After I have completed for you, O Sons, this book which is the last in medicine with its complement, and I have reached the end of it through its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Since operation with the hand is abandoned in our region and time altogether, so that perhaps its knowledge has perished and its trace has been cut off; and nothing remains of it except for small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been changed by hands; and errors and hesitations occurred to them, until their intentions were closed and their strength was weakened. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on it according to the way of positioning, explanation, and abbreviation; and that I would come with figures of the cautery iron and other instruments for work: as is done by adding explanations and hastening what is necessary.
But the reason why a good artisan of it is not found with his hand in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the supports of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and sinews, and their number, and their exit, and of the pulsatile and quiet veins, and of the exits of these.
And because of this, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken about that at the beginning of this book.
"Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we said regarding anatomy is not purged of error, whereby men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who claim to be formed in this science and boast about it without knowledge or experience.
"Which is to say, I have seen a foolish physician cut out a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and he sliced into some of the arteries in her neck; therefore, the woman’s blood flowed until she died in his hands.
"And I have seen another physician who presumed to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large. "He came to him and removed it along with a piece of the bladder. "Wherefore the man died on the third day.
"And I was called to remove it, and seeing the great size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
"And I have seen another physician who received payment from a certain Duke of our land for his medical service: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he suffered a fracture in his leg near the ankle; and the physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong clamps, allowing no air to reach the wound.
"Then he released him according to his wishes. "After that, he released him after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and so it remained until his leg became gangrenous, along with his foot, leading to its destruction.
"So I was called to him and hastened to loosen the bandage; and he found relief and was freed from his pains.
"But the corruption in the limb had already taken hold, and I could not stop it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to walk in the limb until it died.
And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after several days until the evil of it was greatly increased with its lord.
That is, because when the cancer is pure of black bile, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all unless it is in a member that can bear it, so that all of it may be cut off.
And because of this, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the surgical operation is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation associated with health and the operation which involves danger in many dispositions.
And I have already pointed out in every place of this book where an operation occurs which involves fear and dread.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and to avoid it, so that the foolish may not find a way to speak about it and dishonor it.
Receive then the measure with diligence and caution, and your sick with ease and steadfastness, and use the better way which leads by the grace of God to health and praiseworthy success: and leave behind terrible diseases of difficult cure; and lift up your spirits from that which makes you fearful, so that hesitation may not come upon you in your faith and interest.
For it remains more for your glory, and is higher in this world, and finally to the degree of your abilities.
For Galen has already said in some of his advice. Do not treat the bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician.
Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Chapter One.
On Cautery with Fire, and Cautery with Sharp Medicine, this Chapter is arranged and ordered from the head to the feet, including the shapes of the instruments and tools for cautery, and everything necessary for the operation.
Chapter Two.
About incision and perforation, bloodletting and ventoses, and wounds: about the extraction of arrows and similar things: and all this is arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
Chapter Three.
About restoration and dislocation, and the cure of wrenching, and similar things: arranged from head to foot, according to the forms of the instruments.
But before I remind you of the procedure with it, it is necessary for me to say about its benefits and harms, and in which temperament it should be administered.
Therefore, I say that the discussion about the quality of the help and harm of cautery is a lengthy and subtle science, and an obscure secret.
Many wise men have also spoken about it and disagreed about it, and for me, a little from their discussions is enough, fearing prolixity. ✨
Therefore, I say that cautery benefits every temperament, whether material or immaterial, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
About the hot and dry temperament with matter, they disagreed. For some said that cautery is helpful in it. ✨ ✨ ✨ And others said the opposite of this, namely that cautery is not suitable in an illness caused by heat and dryness; for the nature of fire is heat, and it is inconvenient to cure a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
And he who speaks against this said that cautery is beneficial in every warm and dry illness that occurs in the human body; for when you compare the human body and its moistures to the complexion of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say through his speech: for experiment has already revealed this to me many times.
However, it is not fitting that anyone should approach this unless he has already been tested and trained in the final exercise of the chapter on cautery, and has recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration.
As for the other complexions, there is no need to fear; especially in cold and moist illnesses. For all physicians have agreed on these matters and have not disagreed with the use of cautery in them.
And know, my sons, that the secret of cure by means of a cautery with fire and its efficacy over a cautery with combustible medicine is that fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the member that is cauterized; and it does no harm to another member joined with it, except for a slight injury. xspace
But the action of combustible medicine reaches even what is remote from the members; and perhaps it causes illness of difficult cure in a member, and perhaps it kills.  xspace  xspace
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except in excess.
Now indeed this has been made known to us through experience because of the length of our service and study in the art, and our dedication to the truth; and for that reason I am excused from prolonging the discussion.
And if it were not allowed to this book of mine, I would bring you the secret hidden in fire and the quality of its operation in bodies for the purpose of expelling illnesses, demonstrated by a persuasive philosophical speech that would be accepted by your minds.
And know, children, that they disagree about the time when it is best to perform cautery, and they say that spring is the better time.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times because the harm that occurs due to the time is overshadowed by the benefit that is drawn from the cautery. And especially if the cautery is due to severe, urgent pains that do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a worse outcome will occur than the slight harm caused by timing.
And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that only the ignorant and foolish physicians believe that the illness treated by cautery does not always recur; and they conclude this, but it is not as they think. Because cautery is nothing other than a remedy which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, cautery is superior to medicine because of its quick effectiveness, the power of its action, and the intensity of its control. And it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time according to the constitution of the patient, the nature of his illness, its strength, what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluous matter, and what reaches him through food and similar causes, unless the illness for which cautery is applied is fatal.
A subtle illness of a member with few superfluities and humors, such as tooth cautery for pain and similar conditions, it is possible that the pain may not return. "But that occurs rarely.
But the common saying again is true, that cautery is the last resort of medicine; and their intention is not as they themselves intend in it, for they believe that no treatment can be applied together with medicine after the effect of cautery.
But the truth is contrary to that saying, and the meaning, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, does not exist except in this sense: when we administer treatment methods for some diseases and they do not help, then at the end we apply cautery, and it helps; thus it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many stupid physicians understand.
The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this except because of the balance of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that cautery does not cause suppuration in the place where it is applied. However, that is not absolutely true; for I have already tested it and found that cautery itself does not do this in some bodies without other factors involved.
And cautery with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they said. Nevertheless, when you cauterize with fire from gold, the fire does not show you when it is ignited to the degree that you wish, because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly turns cold, if you add more fire upon it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Therefore, the craftsman falls short in that respect; and because of this, cautery with iron is faster and more convenient for us, in terms of correct practice.
And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that those who seek it may find what they want from it.
"Chapter II.
"This cauterization is beneficial for controlling moisture and cold on the brain: these two conditions are causes of headaches, excessive flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, excess sleep, toothache, throat pain, and universally all illnesses arising from coldness, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
"The method of cauterization is that you instruct the patient to first empty the head for three or four nights with cleansing medicine, according to the strength of the patient, age, and habit.
"Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. "Then have him sit upright between your hands, placing his own hands on his chest.
"Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes. "Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
"Then heat the cautery in oil. This is its shape.
"Then place it on the marked spot with ink. Gradually lower your hand to press it firmly and rotate it. "Then quickly lift your hand and examine the spot.
"If you see that the area as large as a lentil or a grain of barley has been exposed from the bone, then lift your hand. "And if not, repeat the process with the same iron or another if it cools, until you see the bone as I have told you.
"Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cloth in the solution. Place the cloth on the spot and leave it for three days.
Then place a piece of cloth soaked in butter over it and leave it there until the fire burn is destroyed. Then care for it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
Now they say that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it sends out; therefore it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and that the cautery should be held until a thick part of the bone is burned.
Then that part which has been burnt from the bone is scraped away, then it is cleaned out.
And others say that it is necessary to go with the cautery to the very end, until it makes an imprint in the bone like a tem, so that the bone falls away; this happens just as if one were using a kirate or the instrument which women put into alphabet infusions. And they believe that from this place the vapors of the head are expelled and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then it should be cleaned out until it heals over.
But these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in some people according to the way of fear.
And to let it go is, in my opinion, better for the patient's health.
For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have shown with other members; and especially when the head of the patient is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and that is what I use. So, work with it for the sake of health.
Chapter III
When chronic and persistent pain occurs throughout the entire head, and the patient uses syrups, powders, purges, oils, and fumigations. And especially if it has already been cauterized with that one-pronged iron I mentioned, and nothing else helps: then consider. For if the head of the sick person is of strong and robust nature, not weak, and he finds extreme cold: then cauterize him with a different iron under that one. Then cauterize him over every horn of his head with the iron, so that it does not pierce the skin, and expose the amount of bone I mentioned. And cauterize him with a single iron on the back of his head at a place called 'uas', which is the location where the windpipe is placed. Raise your hand in this manner, and you will not expose bone. For the sick person finds on account of this an intense pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
And I call this the Cautery in its place. And it is necessary that it be a finer iron than the one used to cauterize the horns of the head and the back of the head.
Chapter IV.
When pain and headache occur in any part of the head, or when the pain extends to the eye and is evacuated with purifying medications, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, but it does not help entirely, then there are two ways to cauterize: either with a sharp burning medicine or with iron. ︎
Now, to cauterize with a sharp burning medicine, take one clove of garlic and peel it, then cut off its ends from both sides. Then divide the place of pain with a broad lancet, until there is a space under the skin where the tooth can be placed. ︎
Insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then bind it with a suitable bandage above. Leave it for fifteen hours, then remove it and extract the garlic. Leave the wound open for two or three days; afterwards place a pledget soaked in butter over the wound until pus forms; then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, make this preparation with some of the warming medicines that I have written about in chapter twelve on heating medicines.
To cauterize it with iron is done as follows: The fire brand, which looks like this.
And it is called a "Claw"; because the head of it resembles the shape of a nail with some curvature, and in its middle there is a small projection.
Then place it on the wound and hold your hand firmly; and slowly rotate the iron with speed; and let the amount that is burned be half the thickness of the skin. And raise your hand so that the vein underneath is not burned and bleeding occurs.
Then soak a pledget in salt water and place it on the wound and leave it for three days; then place a pledget with butter; afterwards treat it with an ointment until it heals. ︎
And if you wish, cauterize this half-head wound with the pointed end of a second cautery. And be careful not to cut an artery in this half-skull, unless it is necessary. ︎
¶ On the method of cauterizing in old half-skulls.
When you are treating half-skull with what we have said in the preceding treatment and in the divisions of diseases, and it does not heal; and you see from the disease that what we have said about cautery with medicine or with a heated iron is not enough, then you should heat a pointed cautery until it whitens after marking the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger or similar to that; and raise your hand once, and bind it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
But you must be careful not to burn the side or the nerve that moves the jaw during chewing, lest a spasm occur.
And be on guard against the flow of blood from the cut artery. For its incision is dangerous, especially for one who is ignorant of what he does, unstudious, and inexperienced; and he leaves off the operation with that in particular.
And I shall pardon myself by remembering to give rules for stopping the flow of blood from an artery according to its manner and in the proper place in this book.
But if you see from the illness that this cautery is not enough, and you see the patient's body tolerating a cautery on the middle of the head, as we have said, care for the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a two-bladed knife.  /> For this cautery is better and more beneficial than that one.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for earache.
When earache occurs from cold and is treated with solutions and other methods of treatment as we have said in the division, but the pain is not removed, then use fire for cautery; and this is what is called a "Puncture," the form of which is as follows:  />  >
Then, after it is heated by fire, make punctures with it around the entire ear, as shown here: or around both ears if the pain is in both at the same time. And keep the cautery a short distance from the root of the ear after marking the places with the iron: and let there be ten punctures on each ear, as shown here.
Then care for the places until they heal.
In the way of cauterizing in Torture.
Chapter VII.
The torture that is treated with cauterization is not anything other than the types which occur from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of torture with medicines, purgatives, gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another a little below its tympanum, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the diseased part. Because softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the manner of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper ear, a little under the horn of the head: and another one on the tympanum, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb. And place your hand with the cautery until the amount equivalent to half the thickness of the skin is burned.  /> Si quis non est prudens in hac arte, vide ne uelimus, ne uideantur perforationes in ea parte.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species made from an old knife, whose form has been mentioned above; however, it is not a little subtler than what you see: and it is necessary that there be a little excess in the thickness of the knife.
Then treat the places with what was mentioned previously until they heal.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for old apoplexy.
When apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment does not help, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head as we said, and a cautery at the back of the head, as previously stated; and let the manner of the cautery be as previously mentioned.  /> Et si fuerit in infirmo fomes, nequeas curare eum: sed poteris curare eum cum cauteriis, et praedicta medicamenta, secundum quod diximus, et si non sanabitur nisi uerecundia tua in deum.
And it is also cauterized with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach; and it is more ultimate.
Then it should be scraped, along with what has preceded.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the first place large henbane seeds and purifying pills for the brain be given to the patient to drink.
Then shave the entire head of the patient and place on his occiput a plaster made from mustard, as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
For this is the method of cautery; and do it in the same way as I have said there.
If therefore he is cured by that, it is good. If not, then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and put the width of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cauteries as described above.
If you wish to add more and the patient is able to bear it, then make a cautery in the middle. If you wish to add more, then cauterize him over both temples.
Then treat the patient until he is cured; and let the cautery be oiled according to the shape described above.
On the Method of Cauterization for Paralysis and Softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed with the purification of the head using henbane and as we have said.  /> ¶ Et sit haec modus Cauterii.
Then shave the patient's head. After that, cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of his head, and with a cautery over each temple, and with a cautery on the back of his head, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of his neck.  /> Et si fuerit necesse: tunc fac ei cauteria quatuor ad uires eius, et sit illud in capite, et inter oculos, et in medio colli, et in medio thoracis.
If however you need to soothe the body with many of those during illness, and if the patient is weak and the disease is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with the last cautery until most of the skin is burned off, and lift your hand. Then care for him until he heals; and thus ends the section on cauterization.
On the manner of cauterizing in epilepsy.
An epileptic is not to be cauterized unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary that you cleanse his brain first with cupping glasses and with the rest of the treatment which we have said in the division, when the patient is large or can tolerate the taking of medicines.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then let him be given gargles and cleansing foods to chew for many days before that, with the improvement of his diet.
Then shave his head; afterward cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of his head, according to what was said before about the manner; and with another cautery on the back of his head, and over each horn of his head with a cautery. But if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned for those with paralysis, and to soothe the body on the vertebrae of the neck and back: and let the final cautery be according to the manner which was said before. 》
But if the patient is a child, then place a fine cautery accordingly.
On the manner of cauterizing in melancholy. 》 》
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned for those with paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of black bile towards melancholy, and the body of the sick person is moist, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a neatly made tortilla from linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and let the sick person, sitting square, be held on every side.
Then present a poultice. And it is more suitable from old ewe's butter. And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of warmth, so that when the finger is inserted into it, it may bear it. Then evacuate it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.  />  Et quando frigida facta est, tollens illud de capite infirmi, fac quod uelis.
Do this for the sick person once a week with the rest of his good regime until he is cured.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures, except that you hold the hand with the cautery; rather let it be fragrant.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place upon it a cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ On the method of cauterizing with water dripping into the eye.
Chapter 13.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the sick person to drink that which cleanses his head.
And keep him away from all moist things, and make him sit in a bathhouse in fasting for several days.
Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head.  />  Et sit hoc in diebus plurimis: et postea fac eum radere caput suum. Then burn the patient above both temples with two irons, if the water flow is beginning simultaneously in both eyes; or from one side only, if the flow is starting in one eye. And cut off with an iron all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the breadth of the temples; and take care to prevent the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and care to prevent the flow of blood.
And sometimes it should be burned on the neck under two bones with two irons fully extended.
¶ On the method of burning away old tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and they are over the veins and arteries which are evident on the outer surface of the head, it is verified that this comes from cold, phlegmatic excesses; then burn with the same iron as I described in the case of water starting to flow, with one iron in the middle of the head, and two irons over both temples, and two irons on the neck under two bones. And if you need to add more, then burn the patient carefully on every side of the eye, at the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small iron.
¶ On the method of burning away nasal odor.
When you are treating this condition with the method we mentioned in division, and it does not benefit from treatment; then hurry up and give infirmocochias to drink for three nights: then shave his head, and burn him with a medium-sized iron and an olive oil cautery. Then burn the patient with two small irons over both eyebrows under the hair.
And be careful not to cut the artery.
And this is the shape of the cupping glass.
In the manner of cauterizing for the softening of the eyelid.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, and this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize [the area] above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side, and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of every cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow, and do not touch with your hand the cautery, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burnt.
In the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn in and prick the eye. )))
There are two ways to cauterize it: either with a hot iron, or with a burning medicine.
But in the case of the hot iron, tell the patient beforehand to let his hairs grow, if he is one of those who plucks them out, until they lengthen and become even. ))) ))) ))) ))) But if they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born. )))
When they are born and become even, then put the patient's head in your lap; then mark on his eyelid with caustic, a mark that should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in slippery elm mucilage, over the eye.
Then, for the cautery iron, which looks like this.
Then cauterize over the figure which you have marked little by little in several places, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned and appears properly.
And the sign of health in your work is that if you see the eyelid already contracting and the hairs rising at the point of the eye.
Then raise your hand (i.e., stop treating): and leave him for three days.
Then put on him cotton with butter, until the scab is removed. Then treat him with ointment, until he heals.
If any of the hairs returns after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
If however the hairs are on the lower (eyelid), then cauterize it until it rises to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
It is that you advise the patient to let the hairs grow until they lengthen and even out. ︎ Make from a piece of cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take from known soap and from unslaked lime one ounce each or so: then grind them together well until you make that quickly, so it does not cool down. Then spread it over the shape of the myrtle leaf that you have made on the cloth, and place it on the eyelid of one or two eyes. ︎ And put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And put your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly. And you shall move it whenever the sick person feels the biting of the medicine, for its biting is like fire.
Therefore, while this biting that he has found persists, then leave off the medicine and move it with your finger. When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid lifted up, as it is lifted up with burning or cutting, it is well: and if not, then repeat on that same spot of medicine where it does not make an impression and does not blacken, until your operation is made equal and the eye contracts.
Then place on it Kohl with butter, until the skin of the burn is removed. Then care for it with diaphoretic ointment or another, until it heals.
And it is necessary for you during the operation that you guard with the greatest care, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid becomes soft after days and something struggles from the hairs into the eye, then repeat the medicine on that spot which is becoming soft from the eyelid, just as you did at first. Then care for it until it heals.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that human eyes are varied in size and smallness. Therefore let your consideration be according to that, and may the way of righteousness not be hidden from him who has an interest in this art. 》
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Lacrimal Duct.
When you are treating a fistula with what we have said regarding the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have an assistant hold their head with both hands so that it does not move or shake.
Then apply a cautery with the shape like this to the eye after placing a poultice of infused cotton in the membrane of an egg or in slippery elm mucilage on it.
Let it be concave like the shape of a vulture's feather quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish for it to penetrate to the other end, or if you wish for it to go upward, do so in this manner.
However, this concave shape is better suited for your task.
Then squeeze out the pus if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Then apply a very hot cautery to it.
And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye towards the side of the nose so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and destroy it.
If you reach with your cautery to the bone at its beginning, it will be good. And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton poultice with butter, and treat him with drying ointment until he is healed.
But if forty days pass and he is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to him until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to its chapter.
And there is another method for cauterizing a fistula that some of the first [surgeons] have said. "> Find the location of the fistula and then place a fine cannula into its slit, that is, a fine tube whose shape is like this. And pour into it a drachm's quantity of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good grasp on the reed, so that the patient does not move at all, lest the melted lead reach his eye.
And you should place over the sick person's eye a cloth soaked in egg white or water.
For lead burns away the site of the fistula and heals it with remarkable healing.
If the fistula is healed along with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal passage and lead the fistula into the course of the nose, so that it will come to its own proper place.
¶ On the method of cauterizing lip fissures.
Often fissures occur on the lip, which are called hairs, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you are treating these fissures with what we have said about the division of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, then use a small scalpel-shaped cautery with fire, in this manner.
And let its cavity be according to the fineness of the scalpel.
Then place the heated cautery quickly on these fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing a mouth ulcer. 😊
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it forms pus and bursts; afterwards it heals and the pus flows out and a fistula is formed: then you treat it, and the treatment does not work in it, then you should heat a cautery according to the size that fits into the fistula. 😊 Then introduce the glowing iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the glowing iron reaches the depth and end of it; do this once or twice.
Then care for him afterward, with what we have said about caring for him until he is cured.
If the pus is drained and healing occurs, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the rotten bone according to how it appears at its head.
On the method of cauterizing the gums and softened teeth.
When the gums are softened due to dampness and the teeth become loose, and you care for them with medicines but it does not help, then place the head of the patient on your lap.
Then use fire to cauterize with an instrument whose form will be shown below, placing the cannula on the tooth; and introduce the glowing cautery quickly into it; and hold your hand briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. ›
And lift up your hand; then repeat the cautery several times according to what you wish. › ›
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour; then spit it out.
For the loose tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
On the method of cauterizing for toothache. › › › › › › ›
When the toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or worm in it, and care with medicines does not help; then cautery in it is in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire. › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › ›
"The cautery for it with butter is as follows: take butter from a cow, and boil it in an iron ladle or in bronze. Then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of the probe. Then dip it in the boiled butter; place it quickly on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools down. Repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; then put a heated iron on top until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth cavity.
The cautery for it with fire is done using a tube of brass or iron. And let its body have some thickness so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
Then heat the cautery whose shape will come; and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or another day.
And it is necessary for the patient to fill his mouth with good butter after the impression of that cautery and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whatever end you wish according to what is possible; and this is the shape of the tube. ➤
¶ On the method of cauterizing in tonsils.
When the tonsils are caused by phlegm and cold humors, do not respond to medicine, and you wish to quickly speed up their digestion, then use a concave cautery like this shape.
It has two open ends so that the smoke can escape from one end while the cautery is heated; and place it once on the swelling, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the swelling. ➤ ➤ ➤
If the abscess is small, then apply a cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it alone for three days, and place over it a bandage soaked in butter until what the fire has burned away is removed.
Then care for it with tooth wax until it heals in the shape of a cannula.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breath.
When the moistures prevail over the bronchial tube, especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary for the patient to be first evacuated with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize him at the crook of the neck near the root of the throat, in a low place; and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, except for some of it.
Then cauterize him with another cautery at the junction of the neck in its last vertebra, terminating there; and let the cautery be small according to the previous method.
Then care for him with what has been said before until he heals.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for lung diseases and coughing.
When the cough and lung disease are from cold moistures, and the patient has no fever, nor consumption, and it is not an old illness: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the collarbone in low, gentle, empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cautery be a cannula according to the previous method.
And if you wish to cauterize by puncturing with a cautery called "Punctum," the form of which has been mentioned for puncturing ear pain; and let there be thirty punctures, almost as many as the other (cauteries).
Then care for him with what came before until he heals.
And now let there be a cautery having three branches, according to this form. Why should he be anesthetized when you perform with him one of the three cauteries at a time?
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to dampness and does not heal within the hour of its dislocation, until it becomes habitual for it to dislocate, then it should be dislocated by a slight movement that occurs as we have already described, at that time you must reduce the dislocation first. Then the patient is placed on his back or on the healthy side. Then raise the skin that is inside the subclavian region upwards with your left hand's fingers: and if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then hold a cautery having two branches with fire. Whose form is this.  • ▭ ▭
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of cauterization with four cauteries will appear.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three branches, why then the figure of the cauterization will be of six cauteries: and the branches are according to the fineness of the silk thread.
And this is the form of the cautery having three branches.  • ▭ ▭ ▭
And sometimes one more is added to this method, making it eight cauteries in total.
Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery. Then make the patient stay still so that the limb does not move at any time until it is strengthened.  •
And if the dislocation is upward (rarely does this happen), then cauterize him on the shoulder with a pointed cautery or by making many pricks with several cauteries.  •
"For the joint is strengthened and moisture removed, and the sick person is healed.
"On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
"When cold and much moisture afflict the stomach, so that it is drawn away from its natural state, and frequent catarrhs are multiplied towards it, and treatment methods do not help: then it is necessary for the sick person to be turned over on their back, and to stretch out their legs and hands. "Then cauterize with three cauteries: one under the size of a chestnut in the thickness of a finger with a clavicular cautery, and two lower cauteries on each side of the single cautery, until you achieve a triangular shape of the cauteries. "And space them apart so that they do not join together when producing pus.
"And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
"And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this pattern without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this pattern. And let the cautery that is used for this cautery be one, according to the shape of a circle according to this pattern.
"And the stomach is to be cauterized by pricking it with this cautery; and it is as if you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you wish with encaustic. Then cauterize it with the cautery of the point, then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it heals.
"On the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
"When pain occurs in the liver from cold and moisture, or from thick flatulence, to the point that it is drawn away from its natural state by an excessive excretion, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and does not improve: then it is necessary for the sick person to be turned over on their neck, and mark three cauteries with encaustic according to this pattern and this quantity at the same place on the liver below the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches. And let the space that is between every cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand much with the cautery." 》
And let the amount that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, and let it be half of its amount not added; and let the patient stand on his feet.
But if he cannot stand, then let him lie down, with his legs stretched out and his arms raised.
This is the form of the cautery.
And indeed it is possible for you to perform this cautery with a scalpel-shaped cautery when you have skill and wisdom in the art.
And be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, and that the thickness of the entire skin is burned, so that the whole body is burned and reaches the intestines; for the skin there is thin, know therefore this.
¶ On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
When an abscess occurs and you wish to know whether it is in the liver or its covering: then if it is in the liver itself, pain and heaviness come upon the patient without sharpness; but if it is in the covering of the liver, there is a very sharp pain along with it. And you will see that its treatment has exhausted its physicians.
Therefore, the patient should recline on his back. Then outline the site of the abscess with a caustic; then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. And this is its form. And burn with it one cautery until the entire skin is burned and reaches the vein, until all the pus comes out; then treat him with the treatment of abscesses until he is healed.
And it is not fitting that one use this type of cautery unless his study in the medical art is prolonged; and through whose hands these diseases have run their course with experience many times; then he may dare to undertake such an operation.
To dismiss it altogether is better in my opinion.
On the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
The ancients said to use the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia for cold pleurisy in this manner. And it is that you should take from the dried, long roots of Aristolochia one root longer than any other, and let it be as thick as a finger. Then immerse it in oil and light it on fire. Then cauterize with one cautery on the place that is between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat sloping towards the area under the chin.
And also with two cauteries on the place that is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping somewhat towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. xspace And with three cauteries from behind: one on the place that is between the two shoulder blades; and two cauteries from both sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary to press with your hand while using the cautery, but let it be freely sensed by the skin.
And some of the ancients said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod; they ignite it and insert it into the intercostal space until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out, as we have said in the case of liver abscess. ♡
But in this puncture with the cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately or a fistula occurs in that place which cannot be healed.
On the method of cauterizing the spleen, Chapter 32.
When you are treating spleen disease, as we have said in the treatment of diseases by division, and your treatment does not help, then there is a need for cautery in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
"One of which is to make three cauteries or four in a straight line following the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, whose image precedes.
And let the size of each cautery be approximately that of a finger or somewhat more or less.
The method of cauterization should be equal to what we have said regarding the liver.
Do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient lie on their back.
Another method of cauterization is to use a two-pronged iron, as mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: lift the skin directly over the spleen where the infirm's left elbow reaches. Lift the skin according to the body's width so that the cauteries fall along the body's length.
Then insert the two heated prongs until you pierce through to the other side of the skin; then remove the iron. Thus, four cauteries are made.
If you wish to cauterize with another iron having three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you have allowed it to discharge pus for many days, for this is more beneficial than any other previous treatment.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in hydropsy.
The cautery does not fall in hydropsy except on the loins properly.
When you treat a hydrocephalic patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and if the treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back between the shoulder blades, one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin. ‌
Then leave the cautery open, so that it may expel pus over time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cautery, because two intentions should be added to him: and with God's help, healing will hasten to him.
The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be key-shaped, as its previous form stated; and that with which the back is cauterized should be almond-shaped, as its previous form stated.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
When they become swollen in a hydrocele and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize above the sole of the foot, which is between the phalangeal and annular bones; raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand and do not press it at all. 
The yellow water will drain, and the cautery should be in this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, one in this way: the cautery should be with the tip of a small knife; and the cautery should be as long as the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg. And there should be two cauteries on each hip; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may drain from it; then treat it with the rest that we have said.
¶ On the method of cauterizing the abdomen when distended.  
Chapter 35   
When there is distention of the abdomen due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; and this is treated with methods of treatment but does not heal; and you see the patient tolerating the cautery well, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as previously stated for the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the umbilicus, with a subtle key-shaped cautery; and a large cautery above the anus over the hemorrhoids, or two cauteries.   
And if you see excessive moisture and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery above the pubis, and a cautery above each thigh: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the navel.
For indeed the treatment is effective, whose benefit does not wander.
¶ On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with that which we have said in division, but the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the back between the shoulder blades briefly in a triangular shape, and with one cautery under the navel about two fingers' width.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him with a large cautery on the stomach, as was mentioned before, and with one on each side of his liver, and another on his spleen, together with a clavicular cautery: and leave an open cautery for some time; then treat him until he is cured.
Chapter XXXVII. 》
When you cut off a nipple, then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then introduce the heated one into the cut nipple itself; and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice.
If therefore the nipples are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have said. Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the ointments, until they are cured.
And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective as a remedy.
§ The Method of Cauterizing an Anal Fistula
Chapter XXXVIII
When the patient does not respond to incision and the operation we have described in its proper place, and is afraid of it, perhaps he can be cured with a cautery.
When therefore someone has an anal fistula and it is old, foul-smelling pus runs from it, and the place becomes corrupt. It is more fitting to do what is necessary: test it with a fine probe. Then learn the depth of its extent with the probe.
Then heat a cautery that is similar to a ray. 😊 Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula itself and also as much of its length as the probe had entered.
And repeat the cautery over it until all the corrupted matter is burned away, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And guard against burning a nerve or large vein if it is there; or if the fistula extends to the body of the bladder or the body of the intestine, then avoid all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you consider that it does not penetrate deeply.
Then care for the place until it heals.
But if the place closes and materials are cut off from it and it remains thus for a long time, then you should know that it has been completely healed. 😊
And if materials are not cut off from it, then you should know that it is deep-seated or there is a corrupted opening at its depth, or something similar to this, whose description will come in its place.
§ The Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys
When pain in the kidneys occurs due to cold or heavy flatulence and weakens because of it, then you should cauterize the patient above the kidneys with a wide-mouthed cautery over each kidney, as described previously.
And perhaps we will cauterize him a second time in the same spot. Why three lines will appear. Therefore, they will be more beneficial in the end.
About the way of cauterizing the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot hold urine, then you should cauterize him in the lower part of the abdomen over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with one cautery from the right side of the abdomen and another from the left side. The length of this cauterization should be according to the width of a thumb's joint. Cauterize him with an inferior spinal cautery, or with two if you need it, as described previously for a wide-mouthed cautery.
About the way of cauterizing the womb.  Chapter 41
When the womb suffers from cold and moisture, which prevents pregnancy and corrupts her menses, delaying their onset and causing pain at their arrival, then she should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the case of bladder cauterization, and with a lower spinal cautery or two. The cautery should be wide-mouthed.
About the way of cauterizing the throat when it is dislocated. Chapter 42
When mucous secretions spill into the windpipe and cause it to leave its proper place: the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when they are compared, and the site of the displacement is found to be empty.
It is necessary to cauterize the patient over a small box of Anchae wax using a similar cautery circle. After you mark it with the cautery around the edge of the box, as if turning it, and so that the box itself falls into the middle of the circle.
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize with three cauteries using a large olive oil cautery, and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then care for it until it heals.
¶ On the way to cauterize sciatica.
When pain occurs in the small box of Anchae and its cause is cold and moisture; and when the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help and grows old; then it is necessary to free the patient from gross humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills and similar ones. ‌ Then cauterize him.
And the way of cautery in it is according to two methods: either with a cautery and drying medicines, or with a cautery and fire. ‌ ‌
A cautery with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is that you cauterize over the small box of Anchae with three triangular cauteries in this form. And make their depth either good or bad. And let the space that is between each cautery be as thick as a finger; and let the cautery be an olive oil one. ‌ ‌
Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the Anchae itself. ‌ ‌ Why are there four cauteries? ‌ ‌
And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form was previously described for the cauterization of the displacement of Anchae, let it be one so that the circle contains the entire Anchae.
And burn away the thickness of the skin throughout.
This is a method for cautery in sciatica when the pain clings to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize with two cauteries on the hip, over the place where the patient indicates the pain is, and your cautery four fingers below the iliac crest towards the flank a little: and let the cautery be of the knife type.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
But if the patient indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a cautery of a point or three, or four, or more, if he needs it.
And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with one knife-type cautery.
And be careful in all your cautery not to go so far with the cautery that you burn a nerve or a large artery and draw upon the patient bad damage or contraction.
And I have indeed seen one and another of those who cauterized above the iliac crest and went too far in cautery, until the leg swelled up so that a tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and rotted away; then there followed dissolution of the belly, and death after that.  ()
If the pain is in both parts at once, cauterize each according to this manner.
And some wise men have said concerning the cautery of the hip, which this method describes. Make a similar needle of iron, whose diameter is half the palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a nut-sized finger or a little less; and inside that needle, let there be another needle, one third in size.
And let there be a space between each needle the size of a thumb's knuckle; and let the needles be open from both ends; and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make for them a handle from iron, fittingly placed in the needles.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it turns red and throws off sparks; then place it on a jar of anchoise oil on the weak side where the healthy side is. Cauterize him, therefore, with three circular cauteries in one go.
Then leave him for three days. After that, apply plasters with butter; and leave the wound open for many days. Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Said Albucasis: "O my son, we have used this kind of cautery little, because of the terror of its appearance; and also, because we have found few who would endure it.
Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauteries for those who can bear it and find its place with it.
The cautery with burning medicines is done like this: make two needles with a perforated ring, into which descends the pin of its door made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; in their height let there be two knuckles, or almost so.
And let there be a space between the two needles the size of a finger's thickness; and let them be open below and above; and let what they contain hold together according to this form.
Then place it on a jar of anchoise oil, with the patient lying weakly on the healthy side. And press your hand firmly over the jar of anchoise oil. Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for an hour; and let the patient bear its gnawing and burning, for he finds the gnawing like fire, until the gnawing stops.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wash away the hot water from the whole wound with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burning is removed; and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it. For it is the last resort in aid.
Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends as far as the hip or leg: make for him a container that holds water, according to what you did for the wound equally.
And this is the way of hot water; and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of drugs. Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part of each; grind both and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which has been pierced with a small hole through which the radius can pass. And place beneath the bottom of the pot another glass pot, and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water so that it covers both by one finger's width; after which you press them together with your hand using good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot. )))
Then gather all that water and pour it over more lime; and boil until it is dissolved again.
For then it will be very strong in acuity, which is used in many operations of medicine and in the cautery of other members. Because it produces the effect of fire itself. )))
And among the medicines with which wounds are also cauterized, as with terebinth, and honey of the pistachio nut, and lime with soap, so that each is mixed together.
And Galen indeed related the treatment of some ancient man by which his pain in the wound and the sciatic vein was cured; and he said it was very effective. He said that no other treatment was needed, and that he was healed in one visit, until he returned and said that perhaps he had entered the bath carried by others, and came out of it already cured.
It should be taken from green seitan: and if it is not found fresh, let it be taken dry, recent; and let it be ground very much with some fat, and placed on the sore, whether it is on the leg or hip; and let it be bound, and left for three hours, or however long the patient feels a relief from the burn. Then put him in the bath.
Therefore, when his body becomes moist, put him into a chair. For the pain recedes and he is cured.
And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides said that goat droppings, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, are beneficial for it; and the cautery is made in this way. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place which is between the big toe and the little finger of the foot, closer to the little finger.
Then take dry goat droppings and burn them in a fire until they become charcoal.
Then place the charcoal on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat that process. Therefore, do not stop doing this until the pain is relieved all the way to the sore and the pain ceases.
And this method of cautery is called the cow's cautery.
¶ Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes back pain occurs from many causes, either by accident or by a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, due to the influx of cold and wet material; and cautery is only suitable for this kind alone, which comes about through the influx of cold material.
It is necessary after the evacuation of the patient with fetid pills and similar ones, that they be made on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the ruler itself, after you mark with a cautery in every line five burns, or more according to the quantity that comes from the strength of the patient: and let the cauterization be done with a small puncture.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a medium-sized cautery in this manner.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an unripe swelling.
This illness often happens to small children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that they experience a constriction in their breath when lifted or moved, and the swelling is found at the end of the spine of the back and it already begins to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize with a circular cautery in this manner.
And let the cautery be placed over all parts of the vertebrae equally; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a puncture cautery in two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other. xspace
Then care for the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware not to administer a cautery on a swelling that occurs from a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing gout and joint pains.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any member of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is customary among doctors to name this specifically gout. xspace
When, therefore, gout of cold cause is being treated with methods of healing, and the pains are not removed, then cautery will remove them.
And it is as if you should cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries, and let the cautery be of olive oil.
And if you need to prick on the sole of the foot, then do so with a pricking iron. If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him on every knee with three or four cauteries from all sides with the same burning iron.
But if you need more of this cautery, then cauterize him with it. And do not dip your hand with the cautery into (the oil), but let it be approximately as thick as the skin.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.  (The "chapter" referred to here is likely the section of Albucasis's textbook that deals with treating these specific ailments.)
But if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the fingers as two lines wrap around.
But if any pain remains in the fingers, then prick each one on every joint and on the palm of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not evacuate the sick person with a good diet or reception of medicines. For if the diet is good and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be cured with God's help along with this cautery.
¶ On the way of cauterizing a hernia.
When a hernia occurs in the groin, and an intestine or testicle descends to the testicle, and this is the first occurrence, it is necessary that you order the sick person to fast on that day.  (Here, "dimittere comestionem" means "to let go of food," i.e., to fast.) And let him use laxatives so that his feces may descend from his belly.
Then have him sit between your hands on his back; and instruct him to hold his breath until the feces or a piece of intestine comes out.
Then bring him back with your fingers, and mark with caustic on the rupture above the pubis, with a mark whose end is similar to half of a circle, towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat the caustic until it turns white and ejects sparks. Then return the intestine or feces to its proper place. Then have the assistant place his hand over the site so that the intestine does not come out; and you have already made an incision between the patient's thighs, and placed a pillow beneath him, and another servant is sitting on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands.  />
Then place the caustic over that mark, with your hand holding the caustic upright. And hold him until you reach the orifice with it; or repeat the process again if you do not reach the orifice on the first attempt.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your use of the caustic, lest you burn it, and cause death or great harm to the patient.
And know that when you do not reach the orifice with the caustic, your operation is of no benefit.
And it is necessary for the caustic to be fine and subtle, according to their size.
Then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound closes.
And it is necessary that you give him food during the time of his treatment, which will soften his belly so that the intestine does not come out during defecation and evacuation.
Then, when he wants to get up after forty days, administer a well-made bandage, and let him hold it for another forty days.
And he should be kept from work, and from excessive food and drink, and from loud voices.
For when he uses this treatment plan, he is cured with complete healing.
And I will say the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly and are beginning, and you want to prevent them from getting worse, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let what is burned be one third of it. Then treat him as we have said: and it will not get worse.
And some of the earlier authors said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with wax and a line is placed which is the width across the top of the rupture, and another line below it. And place your hand in the middle with a pointed cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ On the method of cauterizing for pain due to a fall or blow.
Chapter 48
When pain occurs in some members from a fall or blow and that pain persists for a long time and does not improve with medical treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery of every member should be according to its size and thinness and weakness and strength and the place where the blow struck and caused pain from it. bey
If he is then cured by the first cautery, that is good. If not, then repeat the cautery on him. bey
For it is customary for these pains to be transferred from one member to the nearest one. Therefore, you must use the cautery on them until the patient heals.
¶ On Cauterizing for Leprosy
Sometimes, lepers are greatly helped by the aid of the cautery. And especially the kind of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile; when you wish to cauterize it, take this into consideration.
If the leprosy is at its beginning and you have treated it with what we said in the division, but it does not descend or stay; and you fear for the patient that corruption may spread over his whole constitution, then cauterize him on five points on the head: one in the middle of the forehead, another below it towards the front, at the end of the hairline; two on the two temples; and one at the back of the neck.
And finally, hold the cautery briefly in your hand until it leaves a small impression on the skin, and the scales are loosened from there; so that the exhalation of thick vapors is relieved, and also cauterize the spleen with the cautery, as we mentioned before. 
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and clearly appears; then you should cauterize with these cauteries that we mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two on each cheek, and two on each vertebra of the neck, and six on each vertebra of the back, and a large one on the groin at the base of the tail and one above it in the anus; and two on each shoulder blade; that is, one on each entire shoulder blade, and two on each knee; one on each entire knee, and two on each elbow, and two on each wrist, and two on each tender part of his chest. And you should cauterize him on every joint of the fingers of his hands and feet; and cauterize on each heel of his feet and the palms of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the lower part of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the top of the pubic bone, and another on the top of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, it is a greater help and more beneficial.
And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as the healthy person finds it: because his body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be of appropriate size and shape according to the members and joints: as was previously said concerning the types of instruments.
Then take care of the cauteries with a paste made from herbs and honey, and continue the treatment until it heals.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Coma.
When any member is in a coma and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the comatose member with cauteries, according to the size or shape of the member.
And let your cautery penetrate into the thickness of the skin a little bit. Then take care of it with an ointment until it heals.
And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain type of coma that affects the hand or foot, in the joints of the back at the point where the nerves that move that member exit: and the coma will be removed.
But do not attempt this unless you are skilled in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves that move the body. ]{
Chapter LI
When leprosy is longstanding and nothing helps from the skills of medicine: then cauterize with a deep cautery briefly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Then care for it with a herb and lentil flour mixed with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and the blood of a dove, and the blood of a swallow: let there be an equal part of each; all these are to be mixed together and spread on a cloth, and applied to the place, until it heals.
About the method of cautery for cancer.
When the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery all around it as it is turning.
The wise men have said that it should be cauterized in the middle with the last cautery.
But this does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will cause an ulcer; and indeed I have seen this happen many times. ¶ Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio ultimo in circuitu eius sicuti reuoluitur.
And it is better that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many small cauteries.
About the method of cautery for adubelatis (a type of abscess or boil).
When someone has an adubelatis and it is delayed in coming to a head, either because of an excess of fluid that causes it, or because the patient is old and weak with little blood, or because of the time and you wish to hasten the maturation of the adubelatis, then cauterize around its circumference with many small punctures. Then leave it alone. For it will hasten in its maturation.
But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
And place it in the middle of the adubelatis until it penetrates the skin. The cautery should be made by the infirmarius so that he may lighten the course of the pus.
Then care for it until it heals.
In the manner of cauterizing in a malignant ulcer.
Chapter 44.
A corrosive ulcer is nothing but a corruption walking through the body, and it eats away at it, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see a corrosive ulcer in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then use much fire cautery, both small and large needles, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosion is located.
Then cauterize it on all sides until you have completely eradicated the entire corruption, and nothing remains of it whatsoever. xspace
Then leave it alone for three days and place powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized places until all the scabs are removed, and all corruption is eliminated.
Then care for it with flesh-generating ointments.
If, therefore, you see that after three days healthy flesh is generated, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
And the corrosive ulcer is treated sometimes with sharp medicine. For it arises in the place of cautery.
However, cautery with fire is a faster remedy, and I have already mentioned its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division; take it there when you need it.
In the manner of cauterizing warts and verrucas.
Chapter 50.
Often this disease occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a thick, fibrous growth that injures the foot.
And there are two types of cautery for them: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water. xbspace xthe first is performed as follows: take some sulfur and mix it with the oil of violets and make a small needle from it, and apply it to the wart or verruca. xthen light the needle with a flame until it becomes very hot, and then place it on the wart or verruca. xthen continue heating it until it sticks to it like wax, and when you have done this, leave it in place for a while until it cools down.
"As for that which is with fire, burn a hollow cautery like the feather of a vulture: let it be made of iron, according to the size that contains a nail from all sides; and let it have fine edges.
"Then place the burning one on top of the nail. "Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail until it reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus. "Then apply a plaster on it with wild mallows crushed with salt; and leave the plaster on it at night. "It will indeed be rooted out from its roots.
"Then treat the place with a regenerative flesh ointment until it heals.
"But if they do not turn, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet; then apply a cautery with hot water to them: and it is done by taking a tube made of bronze, or iron, or from a vulture's feather; and place it on the nail or wart."  /> "Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube; hold your hand, and turn it with the pressure of your hand for a moment, so that the edge of the tube is imprinted on the root of the nail, and let the hot water find a path to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait briefly over the stinging of the hot water for one hour.
"Then leave it alone, for the nail will be rooted out with its roots.
"Do this one after another until you have treated all that are on the body.
"Then treat them afterward with whatever ointments regenerate flesh.
"On the method of cauterizing in tremors.
When someone experiences a tremor due to cold in the nerve, or from tertian fever, or for some other reason, then it is necessary to cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the spinal column of the back, and between every vertebrae one cautery, and one cautery on their chest, and one on their stomach.
For the tremor subsides with cautery of olive oil, and health is hastened from cold sickness.
About the method of cauterizing by Albucasis.
Chapter 57
Sometimes foul things are expelled from the body by Albucasis's method, namely pustules which form from heavy, rotten matter.
Therefore, as soon as they appear, they should be cauterized over the top of every pustule with a fine cautery using lit myrtle wood whose tip is set on fire. Or with a long root of birthwort. Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. xspace
And sometimes they are cauterized with a burner at the beginning of their expulsion in this way, and they do not increase; the excess causing them is broken up, and healing comes from them.
However, it should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
About the method of cauterizing for bleeding from an artery in a wound.
It often happens that there is bleeding from an artery which has been cut in a wound, whether it occurs externally or at the incision of an aposteme or member's cautery, and similar things; and it is difficult to stop it. ︎ ‌
When this happens to someone, then quickly place your hand on the opening of the artery and put your index finger over it; and press hard until the blood is blocked under your finger and nothing comes out from it.
Then place a small cauterizing instrument made of iron into the fire and several large ones; blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of the instruments, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been cut; quickly remove your finger and place the cautery on the vein itself, and hold it there until the blood is cut off.
But if it is driven out along with the elevation of your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those that are prepared in the fire.
Do not therefore cease to do this with one after another until the blood is cut off.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, lest something else happen to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off; especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods. Or with a cautery, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood is cut off. ↑ Or it may be tied with a strong thread of binding. Or medicines that have the property of cutting off blood may be placed on it and tied tightly with a decent compress.
However, he who cuts it off with a ligature and constriction with a cloth or with the application of burning substances and such does not help at all, except rarely.
But if this happens to someone and there is no physician present or medicine; then let him begin with the position of his index finger on the opening of that vein, as we have described, and with its very tight constriction, until the blood is held back from the upper part of the wound and above the artery. ↑ And the finger should not be moved; pour cold water of intense cold over it until the blood freezes and thickens, and is cut off.
And during that time he should consider whether anything is needed from the cautery or medicine.
Concerning the incision, puncturing, and venesection in wounds and similar cases.
As we have said in the first chapter, every illness that is suitable for the use of the cautery and burning medicine, along with its causes, instruments, and types of cautery.
And I placed there chapters from the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that what is sought may be clear to those who seek it.  />
And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, O sons, to learn what is in this chapter from fear of what is in the first chapter about cautery.
And because of this, greater care is necessary, for in the operation that is in this chapter, there often occurs an evacuation with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or an incision over an abscess, or the opening of a fistula, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or an incision over a stone, and similar things: from all these comes trembling, fear, and in many of them death occurs.  />  />  >
And I warn you that this hesitation does not fall upon you, for sometimes people with various conditions come to you in this art. For among them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and death is light for him because of the severity he finds from his illness and its long-standing evil.  />  />  >  /> "And with illness from fear which signifies death.
"And among them is one who gives his flute to you and enriches you with it, hoping for health, but his illness is deadly.
"Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such. "And let your caution be greater than your greed and your rapacity. "And do not assume anything from him unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you the praiseworthy outcome to which he has arrived.
"And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognosis and diagnosis for that to which health is properly suited.
"In this indeed you have assistance in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
"May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away your guidance and inspiration, for that is in his hand.
"And I myself have arranged this Chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cautery, from the neck down to the feet, so that it may facilitate for you the search of what you wish and need from it.
"On the treatment of water which collects in the heads of children.
Chapter I
"Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness.
"And sometimes it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
"And I myself have not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and for every one of them that I saw death followed quickly; therefore it seemed to me to abandon the treatment of it.
"And I myself saw a boy from them whose head was filled with water, and his head increased in size every day until he could no longer sit on his own because of the size of his head; and the fluid accumulated until he died.
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and bone, or it gathers beneath the bone above the sinus.
And if the operation is on that [area], and there is moisture between the skin and bone, and an abscess has formed, then it is necessary to cut one incision in the middle of the head, with a width equal to one fingerbreadth; and let the length of the incision be like two finger joints, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of a trepan.
Therefore, if the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place those two incisions according to this form.
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side; and when you press with your hand towards the inside, water flows out and is not hidden from you; then it is necessary to cut three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner.
And after making the incision, remove all the moisture. Then bind the incisions with cloths and wool. Then dress it on top with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with poultices and ointments.
And do not neglect to bind the head securely. And feed the patient with every dry food of little moisture until the part is strengthened and healed.
Another method of incision is to consider where the swelling of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is more on the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right side, or on the left side.  />
Therefore, ascend with your incision to where you see the abscess and the filling of water; and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And be careful not to cut an artery, and cause bleeding, and the patient may die from that bleeding with the evacuation of moisture.
On cutting arteries that are behind the ears.
Chapter 2
When someone has a cold affecting their eyes or chest, and it persists despite the treatment of medications: then the final cure for them is the cutting of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the patient must have their head shaved. Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become visible. Then let the patient tighten their neck with any of their own cloths. Then observe where the vein pulsates.  /> Deinde incide eam superius in medio. And the locations of both are behind the ears and slightly depressed; they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark each with wax and cut both with a sharp scalpel on either side of the opening, and make this incision as wide as the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it from above with this incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' width.
For when the vein is cut, blood flows out in a pulsating manner, which jumps to the innermost parts with frequent leaps.
But if the artery is not perceptible by touch, then measure from the ear the distance of three fingerbreadths. Then mark with wax and find it until you reach the opening.
And what should be released from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will release more or less than that. The entire amount according to what appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Then observe at the wound. Then if something remains at the opening from the bandage, cut it off so that a hot abscess does not form; then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
On the extraction of temporal arteries.
Chapter 3.
When someone has an old hemicrania or acute catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the temples, or an old, severe headache similar to these, and is treated with the methods of medical therapy but does not benefit from it; then we have found that in these illnesses extraction of the arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated, is beneficial.
And the method of operation for their extraction is as follows: the patient should shave the hair from his temples and direct [his attention] to the visible artery in the temple. It is indicated to you by its pulse and rarely conceals itself except in a few people or from intense cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any of his cloths; afterwards, rub the place with a rough cloth. Or steam the place with hot water until it appears clearly to you. Then take the spatula that I described earlier. ︎ Then use it to easily scrape away the skin until you reach the artery. Then insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you have drawn it out of the skin and made it exit from all the tissues beneath it on every side.
If, however, the artery is thin, then wrap it around the end of the hook. Then cut from it a portion according to how much its ends are lengthened and contracted, so that there is no hemorrhage. ︎ For if it is not cut or separated, the blood does not rise up at all.
Then evacuate from blood six ounces, up to three.
If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a double, strong thread of silk or catgut, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the wound has healed, and blood flow occurs.
Then cut the excess between the two ligatures. Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a hot iron until the ends are cut off, using a cautery knife, and it will remain in that place for the same operation.
And this is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever or a hot constitution. For a cautery is among those things which help to dry up humors.  /// The translator's note: "The text here has 'quorum' instead of 'quoniam', which would change the meaning to 'because of those things...' Therefore, it is a better remedy.
And after the removal of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cooked dough and well-prepared poultices placed on top.
And after it has dissolved, scrape with dry medicines that promote the growth of flesh, and with ointments, until it heals.
If during the operation there is bleeding from the artery, then hurry to cut it off with a hot iron or to fill the place with wax; and hold your hand until the blood is stopped. If none of these things are available to you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals.  /// The translator's note: "The Latin text has 'donec congelentur sanguines', with a plural verb form. I have assumed that this is a scribal error and translated as if it were singular."  /// The translator's note: "In the original Arabic text, this section is numbered as chapter 270."  /// The translator's note: "The translation follows the edited Latin text of Meyerhof and Carra de Vaux (1938), with some modifications based on the reading of the manuscripts. And pierce the place with cold water until the pain subsides, and then bandage it as needed.
And to facilitate and ease the extraction of the artery, it is best to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery; let the sharpness of both blades be similar to an almagdatem. However, they are much sharper than two knives. For if they are as sharp as two knives, cold quickly overtakes both of them; and they do not cut the flesh swiftly. Therefore, since there is a little thickness in them, they hold the heat of the fire, and cut the flesh swiftly; with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, easier, and more convenient.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
And let the space between the two blades be as thick as a finger after you mark two places with the cautery; and put both very hot until they reach the vein, cutting it in two places so that what is between its ends becomes long. For they do not heal completely with this cautery.
Chapter IV
¶ On the treatment of persistent, sharp eye-watering.
When tears are persistent and their flow is from the veins outside on top of the head, and medicines with medical treatment do not help; and you see the face of the patient already turning red, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead as if ants were walking there; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hair is now corroded away; and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears—then the ancients needed this procedure for their treatment and called it "treatment with a sword." ›
And it is necessary that you advise the sick person to shave the hairs on their forehead. Then make three equally distant incisions along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be in the middle of the forehead, equally distant from the length of the nose; and the second should be a little further from the movement of the shoulders; and the third should be on the other side. And take care not to cut the arteries that are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all the incisions be like three connected fingers in size: and prepare a piece of sponge for yourself, or many dry cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Then insert a thread with two pointed ends, whose following form is this: From the incision that is near the temple, to the second incision; and with it peel off all the skin between the two incisions, along with the soft tissue that is on top of it. Then do likewise from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove that thread, and insert into the first incision again a different instrument called a sharp knife, gently from one side, not sharply from the other side. And this is its form.
And place its sharp edge toward the attached flesh with the skin, and its gentle side toward the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle incision; and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until what is seen of the skin.
Then do this in the middle incision until the other incision.
And when an equal amount of blood has flowed out, press on the places with clots of blood to stop the bleeding.
Then place a patch of old linen in every slit, and place upon them small balls soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. And see that no hot abscess occurs.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a large infusion with warm water. Then treat it with an ointment of balm and other treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter 5
About the treatment of sharp tears and head colds affecting the eyes from within the head.
When someone has sharp, painful, constant colds, and you see their eyes are thin, small, and their sight is already weakened; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the depths of the head that hurts, and sneezing follows: then know that these things come to pass only from many veins.
And a better treatment for them is this.  /> And it is that you should advise the patient to shave their forehead. Then cut one slit in the middle of the forehead, or another somewhat in width, and begin with the slit from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the mouth; and draw your hand away from the temples that move during chewing until the mouth is exposed; and dry all the blood with a sponge.  />  ·
Then separate between the two lips of the slit with old linen cloth, or with linens from flax. Then bind on top with small balls and soak the balls in wine and oil, so that no hot abscess occurs.
And when you loosen it and see that the hot abscess has lessened: then it is necessary for you to scrub the mouth until flesh begins to form there.  />
Then take care of him with a drying regimen that causes flesh to form, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of resin and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it at the time of flesh formation in these wounds.
Chapter VI
§ On the care for what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water, vinegar, and the like; or some kind of animal.
When, therefore, a stone or something of the kind from those which do not grow and are not added falls into the ear, expose the ear to sunlight; but if you see the stone, then drip some oil of violets or sesame oil into the ear. Then administer an extraction and cause sneezing with a condiment; and plug the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you have placed around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
For often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then administer the extraction with tweezers, that is, fine pincers; and their form is this.  />
If it comes out with the tweezers, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction with a fine, small-bladed hook.
But if it does not come out through that, then make a tube from metal and insert the end of the tube deeply into the opening of the ear, and plug what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there be no way for air except through the tube; then draw it out with your strong attraction. 
Often indeed it goes out with what we have narrated. But if it does not go out in this manner: then take from helkalimbat or from glue prepared with which birds are caught, a small portion; and put it at the end of the stick after you have wound over it a neatly placed bandage. Then insert it into the ear canal easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Therefore if it does not go out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut open (the ear) before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the manner of cutting is that the physician should first open a vein on the head; and draw blood from him according to his strength. Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward; and find a small cut in the root of the ear at its fatty part in a depressed place itself; and let the cut be lunar shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instrument is possible for you. 》
Then either make the cut swiftly yourself and take care of it until it heals.
If however the thing that fell into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell up, then administer an extraction for it.
But if it does not obey you to go out, then take a thin, subtle spatula according to this shape:
And apply an incision of that kind for the grains which fall into the ear and do not do this when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear until you place it in many pieces; then remove them with tweezers, or a fine probe, or suction, as we have said, for its extraction will be eased.
For water which enters the ear, it is fitting for the patient to use sneezing first of all; and now he has filled his ear with some old bandage; and he lies upon that ear in which there is water. If it exits through that part, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of your finger, thin and soft, and heat them slightly with fire; and let the sick person put one of them into his ear hole: and let him jump on one foot on that side, and strike it with another stone on the stone which is in the ear. Therefore, do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone until all the water comes out.
And now the water comes out in such a way that you should take one of either rush or reed, and insert its tip into the ear; and set fire to the other end with a flame, until most of it is burnt. Then repeat this with another rush, and do it many times until all the water comes out; and remove it with a probe as previously mentioned for the stone.
But if an animal enters it, and its body is small, like a flea, then care for it as I said in the section on division.
But if it has a large body, which is perceptible to the senses; then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks: and this case is easier than all others that are retained in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm born in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not help; then you must examine the ear in sunlight. 》 If something from the worms is visible there, then remove it with tweezers or fine hooks.
But if nothing is visible there, then take a probe of this shape, narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; and insert its thin tip into the ear according to how much the patient can tolerate; then draw with it strongly. For this, often, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then fill the circle of the probe with wax, as I said about the stone.
If they do not come out with what I said: then administer the distillations that the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms; and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring be that with which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is drawn here. As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow at the bottom, in which there should be a small hole, wide at the top.
Let, therefore, the plunger that is inside the cavity of the probe be made from bronze, well-crafted. And if you wish, take a reed and wrap the tip of it neatly with cotton; then pour oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the probe; and let the probe be in the ear; then insert the reed with the cotton on top and press it gently with your hand until the oil is pushed into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels it inside; and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed a little by fire; and be careful that it is not very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.

Chapter 7.
¶ On the treatment of gold impaction.
Sometimes some infants come out of their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it has also happened to some people that an impaction occurs in the ear canal from a wound or flesh born there.
And this impaction sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which sight cannot follow; and sometimes it happens near the outer part of the canal, and sight follows it.
That which occurs in the deep part of the ear and is not seen by the eyesight is difficult to heal in many cases.
And in that which follows sight, you should place the ear of the patient in the sun and look at it; then if you see a visible obstruction, open it with a fine probe, the shape of which is as follows: its tip should have a small width, part of which is sharp, and the rest of the probe should be smooth on two sides so that it does not harm the ear.
If therefore the obstruction is formed of flesh within the ear, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
But if the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth probe and heat it with fire for a short while; then insert it into the opening of the ear.
If therefore you feel the obstruction along with what the patient finds with a heavy hearing, endeavor to open it with ease; and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.  ///
Then place a linen bandage over the ear according to the size of the opening, rolled up in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Or take a linen cloth and soak it in rose water; then sprinkle ground alum over it and use that.
But if you see the ear swelling already, then it is necessary to remove the linen cloth and leave it with another linen cloth that you will roll up in a plaster made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides; then treat it until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water and place the ear on it; and use the rest of the treatment which cuts off the aforementioned bleeding in the section on distillations.
In the care of ptosis of the eyelids.
Chapter Eight.
These ptoses that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or with a hook and cut them from their roots with a scraper. Then place ground cinnabar on the places.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And it is better to cauterize them after the incision. For often they return when something remains of their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ On the care of chalazion in the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter Nine.
It often happens that something appears in the eyelids similar to a chalazion in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is named 'grain'; it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation for them is that you should then consider if there is a 'grain' emerging from what appears on the eyelid and it moves in all directions, and its nature is easy.  ?>
Therefore find above it a slit of suitable width. Then excise it from all sides easily until it comes out. Then hang it with a hook and cut it off.
But if its removal is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it may harm the patient somewhat.
If the slit is large, then close it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. The ointment restores it and fleshes it out.
And if the gravel has slipped into the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then turn back the eyelid and hook out the gravel with a hook; besides this you will need to make an incision and press it from all sides.
And if the eyelid is stretched by the incision, this does no harm.
Then after the incision of the gravel, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the place with what makes it fleshy until the patient is healed.
¶ Concerning the treatment for inflammation of the eyelids.
Chapter 10
Chapter 10: Concerning the treatment for inflammation of the eyelids. Trachoma is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid; and it occurs most often in children. It weighs down their eyes, and they are afflicted with catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the sun because tears rush to them, and on account of this you see them always lying face up, and sleeping that way, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which are already covered by swelling. And indeed, the prominent Axirnath is visible in the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of operation is for the patient to place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare strips from it, and make a circle from those strips according to the size that contains the Axirnath on all sides. Then place it [the circle] over it [the eyelid], and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. ⟩
Then find in the middle of that moistness with a small blade making incisions through its width, and let the incision not be deeper than that made for bloodletting. ⟩
Or it is necessary to excise the entire skin until you reach the achilles tendon, for in many cases the Achilles tendon protrudes from the opening in the shape of a piece of white fat.
Therefore, extract it with a cloth which you have inserted between your fingers towards the outside: and turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add [anything] into the opening, so that you do not reach the eye with the spoon and injure it.
However, if the Achilles tendon does not appear to you at the beginning of the opening, you should introduce a little [instrument] into the opening with ease until the Achilles tendon protrudes. Then extract it as we have said.
Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the wound, and bind it with little pieces of wool.
And there are some people who grind salt and place it in the cavity of the opening, so that it melts whatever remains of that moisture.
Then care for [the wound] until it heals.
However, if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then care for [the wound] with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ Concerning the types of ataxia of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye becomes lax, so that it blinks as it should not.
Chapter XI.
When hairs are born in the eyelids of the eye beyond their natural course among the natural hairs and they grow old; then these [hairs] harm the eye and cause various diseases to occur, such as constant tearing, laxity of the eyelids, and opacities, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
And ataxia of the eye is treated according to four methods. ¶ The first method: ¶ Take a needle and dip it in water and sulfur, and pass it along the edge of the eyelid, and burn [the hairs] with fire; and this is done only once. ¶ The second method: ¶ Take a red-hot needle and burn the entire length of the hair from its root to the tip, while it is still attached; but be careful not to touch the skin, so that you do not cause an inflammation or other harm. ¶ The third method: ¶ Take a very fine and sharp lancet, and make two incisions in each eyelid, one on each side of the [hair], while it is still attached; and then pluck out the hair, along with its root; but be careful not to cut into any vessel. ¶ The fourth method: ¶ When a person feels that the hairs are growing or when he sees them with his eyes; then take a needle and dip it in water and sulfur, and pass it along the edge of the eyelid; but be careful not to touch the skin, so that you do not cause an inflammation or other harm. By cautery with fire. With a sharp medicine, as was stated in the chapter on cautery. Ataxia is cured by incision and suture. By tubes, as I will explain.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head on your lap. Then, turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If it turns, that is good. If it does not, insert a needle into the eyelid from below, so that the thread runs over the needle and is close to the eyelashes themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are born; then draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a stick.
Then find within the edge of the eyelid under the lashes, by means of a spatula introduced from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser.
Then remove the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with wax in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, because this varies greatly among people.
Among these is one who needs a large amount of the eyelid to be cut off, according to the size that is softened by the eyelid.
Then with the spatula find on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser; let there be one slit near the natural lashes, as thick as a stick.
Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.  Bible Then peel it all off.  Bible Then sew together the two lips with a needle and fine wool thread; then clean away the blood, and make the superfluous threads stick together over the two eyebrows with some adhesive substance, if you wish to do that; but if not, it is of no importance.  Bible  Bible
Then leave the stitching and threads for three days, or four; afterwards care for it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitching and treat it with what dries and tightens. For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its healing; but it will be better in the future.
This method of treatment ancient people taught Ataxmir.
Nevertheless, there is concern for the patient in this [method], and it comes from good practice, and there is no fear [of complications] in it.
And there is another method in Ataxmir as well: and it is to make a mark on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks or connected together in this following shape, then cut off what is superfluous with small scissors according to this shape, maintaining equality in the cutting.  />
If it is not possible for you to hold the hook and make it equal, then take a needle with a thread in it and insert it into the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the larger lacrimal [point] and a third thread near the smaller lacrimal [point]; and hold the threads together between your fingers with equality.
Then lift your hand with equal elevation; and lift the skin over the marked point, as we have said.  />  />  />  />
Then join together the two lips of the wound with stitching; and treat it until it heals.
If an abscess occurs at your incision or cut; cauterize it with a hot iron and similar [substances] from the soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes of the eyelid also turn inwards.
Therefore, you should use what we have said about the incision [in this case]; but the stitching is more skillful for both [eyelids]. "On treating Ataxmîr with dogs.
"And you should turn the eyelid and cut the slit that is inside, as I have told you. "Then skillfully make two reeds or two thin sticks: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of the spatula; and you have already cut at the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
"Then place each one with delicacy on the excess from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two reeds from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. "For the skin that is bound will die, blacken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
"If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. "Then treat it until it heals.
"When it is healed, the eyelid will rise; and the hairs will not prick.
"And this is the shape of the two reeds that you make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.
Chapter XII
"On raising the pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
"The operation in this case is to take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of fine, soft silk." ờ "Then gather the ends together and tie each one with a very fine knot; and let the length of the thread be about four inches.
"Then place another fine thread under it briefly, and tie its ends if you wish.
"Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near sunlight to illuminate the work; for this is a delicate or fine operation.
"Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you extract it above the natural hair.
Then pull the thread up over the stitches; and introduce that thread into the stitches, if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the thread comes out with the stitches on the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the stitches are pulled out and the thread does not come out with them, pull the stitches downwards along with the thread that you sewed into them, until the stitches come out of the upper hole, and you see it by the eye's sight; then indeed pull the stitches and the thread, and remove both, and close the eye, and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs and raise it with that; or leave it alone until it lengthens after some time, and then raise it up.
Chapter 13.
When this entropion happens to the eye, it is called leporine.
And this entropion is either natural or accidental.
The accidental one occurs from the healing of a wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you cut open that healed area and separate its lips, and place between them a wick of linen, and bind it until it heals.
And you should not use in its cure things that dry and constrict, for if you do this, the entropion returns worse than before. Indeed, use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek; and a poultice with water in which mallow, flax seed, and dyaquilon ointment melted with some of the oils have been cooked; and wrap with it a wick, and treat with it. ›
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all skill, lest it consolidate according to the form which was in the first place.
And this operation that I have mentioned is nothing but a correction of the alcatrat, so that the form of the place does not return completely to what it was before.
About the care for alcatrat that occurs on the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkle or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV
This alcatrat that occurs below is what is truly called alcatrat. And it is natural and it is accidental.
And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or tear, or branding, and similar things.
And the way to operate on it is that you take a needle in which there is a double thread, and dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the skin upward with a needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.  /> Therefore, if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good.  />
And if not, take a thread and place it in the tear, and turn the eyelid with it; and find two tears on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two tears be from the two corners of the incision until they meet and form a corner: until when they are gathered together this shape is formed, which is in the form of the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that skin to the extent that its lower sharp side extends from where the eyelid follows. Then bring together the separated parts, or sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said about softening ointments and compresses until they heal.
And if it happens to the Xatrati due to a tear or stitching, or cauterization, then you should split the tear smoothly under the eyelashes, just as was mentioned before. Then separate between the two lips with a probe, as we have said.
And the main point about caring for the Xatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Xatrati.
For it is of many different forms: and a skilled craftsman prepares his ingenuity in whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form or very close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in numerous arrangements.
Chapter 15.
About the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
It sometimes happens to many people that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Therefore, you should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula that is not sharp like other spatulas, but rather blunt slightly, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and does not harm the eye with its sharpness. And your incision should be as if you were easily excising that adhesion until, when the eyelid returns to its natural form, the entire adhesion heals.
Then irrigate the eye with salty water and wash it with plain water, or distill into it from a sieve made of crushed juniper berries mixed with water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen probe. And place over the eye a wool compress soaked in egg white. And on the third day use a sieve and patches until it heals.
Of the incision of the nail and prominence of the tear-duct flesh.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two modes. Or it is sinew-like, and it is similar to silica, hard and fine. 》 Or it is not sinew-like, similar to frozen white moisture; when you touch it with iron or try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not stick into it.
And both types do not grow except from the larger tear-duct, until it gradually reaches the eye and covers the sight, blocking light and the movement of the eye.
And the way to operate in its incision is that the patient places his head in your bosom. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 Then open the patient's eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand. Then collect the nail with a small hook and extend it upwards. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or cow hair, or goat hair; and let the thread be strong and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail. And penetrate with the needle and bind the nail with the thread and extend it upwards; and scrape off with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sewing it with the hair to its end. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear-duct with a fine spatula or small scissors; and leave the tear-duct flesh in its natural state so that from cutting it, the flow of tears does not occur continuously.
And sometimes the nail is extended with only a hook; or with thread, as we have said. Then it is scraped with a soft spathame, like this one.
And be careful that the spathame does not touch the corneal membrane, lest a tear occurs and the pupil is pierced.
Then after the incision, cast into the eye some crushed salt or a sieved powder of ziniar, and let it remain until another day. Then care for him with what is needed until he is healed.
But if the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it or secure a hook within it, then this type of nail can be treated many times with medicines, and it heals as I have narrated in the section on division.
But if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the patient, and take a soft, gentle, weakly sharpened spathame according to this form.  /> And scrape away the nail from above with finesse and delicacy. But if you see that it is becoming thin and crumbles away and the scraping leaves an impression upon it, then pour into the eye at the hour of sleep a sieved powder of ziniar or a sieved red powder or crushed salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Then repeat this procedure upon it, until all of it is removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye: then leave it alone and treat the abscess until it heals.
Then repeat the procedure upon it with finesse until it heals.  />
But if the prominence of the tear gland causes great harm in the eye, it should be hooked and a portion of it cut away with a hook: and do not complete the incision, so that the flow of tears does not stop.
Then drip into the tear duct a sieved red powder or one made from ziniar, until it heals.
In cutting Alguardenic and the flesh that grows on the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in the eyes of certain people a red fleshy growth appears, either composed or laid on top, until it covers the pupil or approaches and presses upon the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles the stem of a rose.
And the operation on this is also that the patient places his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or tweezers.
Then first cut the flesh until you have completed its entirety with a scalpel. And be careful not to harm the eye during the operation; and let your incision by which you cut it be either with a lancet, as we have said in the cutting of the nail, or with small forceps, with which asebel is collected, as will be shown in the following chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed and all of the Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or pour into it red powder and similar corrosive medicines; and place on top of the eye a poultice made from the white of an egg: so that it may be protected from hot inflammation. ️
But if something remains of the Alguardenic and you are dominated by hot blood and fear a hot inflammation, then leave the eye alone, and care for it with that which settles inflammation.
Then repeat the procedure on it until it heals.
And do similarly with additional flesh that happens to appear in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that a stranger should perform the cure of every weakened eye either by natural means or by accidental means, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that this member can bear that operation.
About collecting seed from the eye.
Chapter Eighteen.
The seed are red veins that cover the eye and prevent it from functioning properly: they weaken the eye over time.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye with the seed is strong and has no other disease besides the seed: then collect the seed from that eye.
And instruct the patient to place their head in your lap. ️
Then hang those veins with one or two hooks according to your discretion; and let the hook be thin and double-edged, like this shape, or there may be two hooks on a single body, like this shape.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and loosened; and be careful not to damage the eye with the tips of the forceps.
And let your procedure be at midday in the sunlight, and be very steady in your work: so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then drop into the eye a green or red juice: so that its sharpness can corrode what remains of the seed.
But if you are not able to collect all of it in that time, then apply a bandage to the eye with something that will soothe the pain of the eye; and leave him for several days until the pain subsides and is released from the warm swelling: then repeat on him according to the same method until he is healed. ️ ‍
And this is the shape of the forceps.
About reducing a broken nose.
Chapter Nineteen.
Doctors call the broken nose a fistula, which you treat with a cautery or sharp medicine that burns, as its previous account has described.
And if it does not heal, then there is no cure for it; unless you pierce above the abscess at its birthplace, and draw out all the moisture and pus that is in it until the mouth (of the abscess) is uncovered.
When therefore the mouth is uncovered and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape.
And it is called "Rough Cap.
Let it be made of Indian iron and let its head be round like a needle and have the punctuation of a file or very fine awl puncturation, and place it on the corrupted bone site.
Then turn it between your fingers and press with your hand a little while until you know that the corruption is already scraped off; and do this several times.
Then restore the site with drying, styptic medicines.
If the site then becomes solid and flesh grows on it, and the flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days without renewing, or forming an abscess, and nothing else happens to it, then know that it has already been healed.
And if not, then there is no cure for it, unless you bring the fistula to the nostril opening, in this way.
And it is, that you uncover the bone with a knife or sharp medicine; and when the mouth is uncovered, then take a borer of this shape, its tip should be iron and triangular; and let its wood be a tapered pyramid up to the tip as you see.  ()
Then place it on the mouth itself; and let it be near the lacrimal; and move your hand a little away from the eye. Then turn your hand with the borer until it penetrates the mouth and the patient feels it; by this means he finds wind coming out of him when he places his hand on his nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I have taught you.
When the flesh is born and the place becomes hardened, then the material that was flowing out to the outside returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter on the sick person.
¶ On the Reduction of Protrusion of the Eye.
Chapter 20
When the eye protrudes completely but there is no damage or decrease in vision, then it is necessary that you release the sick person; afterwards bleed him; then place cupping glasses on his neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply to the eye a salve made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and colophony. Then bind the eye on top of the plaster with many little poultices.
And the method of making poultices is as follows: take many soft cloths and double each one over four times; make many of them; then place one on top of another according to the amount that the eye needs; then bind them with a hard cloth tightly.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if the bandage becomes soft again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.
If you see the eye has returned to its normal appearance, that is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, poultices, bandage, and cupping glasses until it heals.
¶ On the Incision of the Eye's Tunic
Chapter 21
When a disruption occurs in the eye's tunic and it protrudes from the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and it disfigures the appearance of the person because of this, and you wish to incise it, then the operation on it is as I will narrate: and it is, that you introduce a needle in the root of the eye from below to above.
Then introduce another needle with twice as much thread from the tear duct, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle in place according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it around the edge of the vein in a circle; and tighten it very much.
Then remove the needle, and place on the eye a piece of wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls out with the vein.
Then take care of the eye with what strengthens it, until the wound heals.
And sometimes the vein is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye grows very prominent.
Then it is pierced with a fine needle so that it reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture runs out, and the eye descends; then tie it immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
§ On the treatment of trachoma.
Chapter 22
This disease called trachoma is nothing but pus that gathers in the eye, similar to water dripping down; and it is not itself.
And the method of working on it is as follows: make the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat. 
Then take his head with both your hands and move it until you see the pus come to the lower parts of your eyes. Then it remains still and does not go down, and the light is released; and the patient sees things as he used to see them; and if it has not gone below, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus does not prepare with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands. Then take a fine needle and pierce with it above the small piece of skin for a short time at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane, until the pus comes out.
When he exits, then drip warm water into the eye to which you have added honey; or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
§ On the care of water that has descended into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter 23.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the division, and that which is suitable for making an opening, as declared and expounded by speech, then take the same according to health.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to make the sick person sit between your hands facing the window towards the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tie it very tightly; then with your right hand, hold the eyelid of his eye if the eye containing water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Then take almagda in your right hand if the eye is left; or in your left hand, if the eye is right.
Then place the end of the almagda near the crown with a thickness equal to that of a ray on the white part of the eye where the tear duct appears; then push the almagda with force; and you turn your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almagda has already reached an empty space. ¶
And the measure of the journey of the almagda to the depth should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil until the end of the blackness; and this is the crown of the eye. For you will see it in the very pupil of the eye's vision because of the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Then place the almagda to the point where the water is located. Then press it down with one force after another. ¶
If the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that immediately on which he opens his eyesight, and almagda in his eye.
Then rest for a little while. Therefore, if the water descends, then remove it secondly, except that almagda comes out.
Therefore, when it sticks and does not rise, then remove the almagda easily; and you slowly turn your hand.
Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water and wash the eye with it inside. Then place outside the eye the entire flax or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with a healthy eye.
We, however, and those of our time, place on it ground barley with egg white.
But if the almagda does not obey you when entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a human whose eye is very hard, then you must take an instrument called "spatamile," which looks like this:
Therefore, prick with it only the conjunctiva and do not extend your hand into the opening; and you should make a subtle path to the almagda's place.
Then introduce the almagda, as we have said.
And at the end of your work, let there be prepared for the sick person a well-made bed, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and he shall be kept from all movements and from coughing; and give him food by which his nature is soothed; and let him not move his head at all to the right or left.
And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Then remove it in that dark house, and test his eyesight; and make him see things. 》 Then bring back the ligament until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary that he do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision; rather, it should be avoided because water rises quickly through a strong gaze.
But if a hot aposteme occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day and correct it with something that will calm the aposteme until it calms down; then absolve the sight of it, and place an orale on its face to regulate the sight under it for several days, while he remains in that dark house.
Then let him go out from the house gradually, and turn to his usual activities.
And know that in salt water, the student is not excused from frequent vision; then he may dare to proceed with the operation.
And indeed there came to us a certain one of those who are from Aleppo, who said that in Aleppo a magdan was pierced, through which water is sucked out.
But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of species from the magdan, as if one who does not know them were to stand over it.
They should be made properly of brass; and their ends should have the same subtlety as those that are triangular and pointed.
Chapter XXIV
¶ On the care of flesh born in the nose.
Sometimes various fleshes are born in the nose, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from this is a cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark in color; and from this is a gentle flesh, not dark in color.
In those cases where the flesh is soft, not deceiving, and not cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands facing the ground. Open his nose and throw the hook into those fleshes; then draw them out, and cut what you have grasped from them with a fine sharp spoon on one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If something remains that cannot be cut off, then scrape it with a fine, sharp instrument until nothing remains of it. But if the bleeding is severe or a hot abscess occurs, then apply what is necessary: if it is one of the malignant abscesses, hurry to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is removed.
Then throw vinegar, water, or wine into the nose after cutting. But if the nose is opened and fluid comes out as far as the palate, then know that he is already cured.
But if the fluid does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh formed on the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the cutting.
Then it is necessary for you to introduce a thread of linen with some thickness and many knots tied in it, and place between each knot the size of a finger or less. The patient should then incline his head so that he can send one end of the thread into the nose with a rod or something similar after making it like a needle: he should draw out his nasal mucosa until it reaches the cavity, and comes out over his throat.
And indeed, similar to this are the tricks that boys do in school: it is an easy thing for someone who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread: one end that comes out over the nose and the other that remains inside the nose. Then the seamstress sews up the flesh with knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the skin is already tied with knots of thread.
Then remove the thread; and put on the nose after washing away the blood an ointment that you have soaked in Egyptian oil: do this for three days or more, until all the ointment has eaten away what remains of the flesh.
Then at the end of the process, place a lead pipe into the nose for several days until it heals.
If, however, dry treatment is needed, use that.
For making a head-purifier with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or copper, similar to a small lamp, open like a shell; and its opening likewise.
And if you wish, make a closed pipe, like a reed.
And the opening of the instrument for making a head-purifier should be full and open; it should have a handle at its end with which you hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish in it from juices and meltable things.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp arises at the tip of the nose and increases and grows with time until its appearance becomes ugly.  />  />  />
And because of that it is necessary to cut it off at the beginning of its appearance and root out all of it. Then place on its site either a caustic or a burning medicine that will remain in its place.
If therefore its cutting is delayed until it grows larger, then examine whether it is stony, hard, dark in color, with little feeling; then do not touch it with iron because the abscess is malignant.
I have often seen that when someone gets a boil, a great evil befalls him who has it.
And if the boil is soft to touch, not black in color, and you see that it can be cut entirely, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear or hesitation: and treat the place with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
Chapter XXVI
¶ On suturing the nose, lip, and ear.
Know that when a break occurs in one of these cartilages, operation is of little benefit, except in certain people.
Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: then apply dressings to the wound along with the stitching; and then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the separation have already been separated and each part is healthy: then you should scrape off all parts from their skin until they bleed. Then join the two lips with stitching and tighten them, and sprinkle over the blood powder of dragon's blood and crushed frankincense; and place on top of the powders a piece of adhesive plaster and some other from the consolidating plasters: and leave it tied for two days or three.  Then release it, and change the medication; and leave it until the threads dissolve by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of stitching is to join the separation either with needles, as we have described for stomach stitching; or join the separation with thread, as I have taught you.
Chapter XXVII
¶ On extracting lip nodes.    
"Indeed, many people develop hard growths similar to grains of barley on the inner surfaces of their lips; some are smaller and others larger.
"Therefore, you should turn the lip inside out, search for all its nodes, and hang it with a hook, then cut it away from every side.
"Then fill the place after the incision with pounded wheat until the bleeding stops.
"Then bind it with vinegar, and scrape the place where the wound is until it heals.
"Chapter 28
"About the incision of the flesh of the gum over the gums.
"A growth often appears on the gum, which the ancients call ablus.
"Therefore, you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing the pus or blood to flow out.
"Then place pounded wheat or other astringent, drying powders on the place.
"But if that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does return—then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return again after cautery.
Chapter 29
"About filing teeth with iron.
"Sometimes rough and ugly scabs form on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and out, between the gums, which may blacken, turn yellow or green until corruption reaches the gum, making the teeth foul and unsightly.
"Therefore, you should make the patient sit between your hands, with his head on your lap, and file the tooth where you see scabs and something like sand; continue until nothing remains of them. Do the same for blackening, greening, yellowing, and other discolorations until they are cleansed.
If therefore that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the reason, it is good; and if not, then repeat the reasoning over them on another day, second, and third, until at last the study reaches its desired end.
And know that the tooth requires razors of diverse shapes and many figures, according to which it is prepared for your operation; therefore, the razor with which one shaves the tooth from below is different from the razor with which one shaves between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And let these forms of razors be prepared for you, as you see them.
Chapter XXX
¶ On the Extraction of Tooth Pain
It is necessary that you cure the tooth from its pain with all skill and be slow in extracting it. For its replacement cannot be supplied when it is extracted, because it is a high substance; therefore, there can be no excuse for extracting it, unless when the patient is forced to extract it in order to strengthen and confirm the aching tooth to you.
For many times the pain deceives the patient and makes him think that it is in the tooth and he extracts it; then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen this from the practice of bloodletting.
When the aching tooth itself is confirmed to you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a lancet, on which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all parts; then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until you shake it out.  />
Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and hold the patient's head between your knees so that you have already held it well, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the object from all sides with ease, and attempt to move it as you did initially.
However, if the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with cloth and tie it with a fine thread so that it does not break during your constriction on it with forceps.
And you must carefully make an incision all around the gum from every side very much.
And be careful not to break it, and let a part of it remain, so that the worse evil returns upon the patient with greater pain than before.
And beware of doing what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and audacity when extracting it, beyond what we have described to administer.
For often they cause great illnesses to happen to people, which are more difficult to break and all its roots remain, or some of them; or they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed this.
Then it should be washed after extraction with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
If there is bleeding from the site (for this often happens), then grind some zegi and fill the site with it; if not, cauterize it if zegi does not help you.
The form of the fine forceps with which the tooth is initially moved should have long tips and a short handle, and be thick so that they do not bend when pressed on the tooth; as you see in large-handled forceps, until when you tie them, they do not give way or bend; of short tips, and made from Indian steel or well-made from faled steel with straight tips: and at their tips there should be teeth, some of which fit into others and bind firmly.
And sometimes the extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are very constricted.
Chapter 31
About the removal of teeth, and the extraction of broken jawbones.
When something remains after the extraction of a broken tooth, then it is necessary to place a poultice on that place with butter for one day, or two days, until the place softens; then introduce into it algasti, or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork. The shape of these is that of forceps.
Their extremities should be made like a file inside, or like tweezers.
If it does not obey you in leaving with these forceps, then it is necessary that you make a hole in the root, and expose all the flesh, and introduce an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Its extremity should be short, slightly thick; and it should not be made wet, so that it does not break.
If the root comes out through this, it is good; and if not, help must be given with these other instruments whose forms are these. ■
The form of the first is a triangle, with thickened extremities.
The form is that of a subtle triangular extremity. ■
And with other instruments and tools that have been mentioned in the section on teeth.
It can also be helped with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, a triangular twisted extremity, with some thickness so that it does not break; and it should not be made wet.
And know that there are many instruments of teeth; and likewise the other instruments are not counted, and a skilled craftsman finds for himself an instrument suitable for his work and the diseases themselves. □ ■
Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not name an instrument due to the diversity of their kinds.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then search over it with that which suits it among the instruments and forceps that I mentioned for extracting roots, and aid with this probe, whose form is thus.
Let there be in it something of thickness gradually, so that the bone is caught and held with it, and does not flee and wander, until the bone exits: and restore the place with suitable medicines for that.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction and care for it until it heals.
Chapter XXXII
On the Sawing of Prominent Teeth above Others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly appearance is made by that; and especially when this happens to women and girls, that is, those who have been sold (i.e., married off).
Therefore, you must consider. For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or its sawing and filing are possible: then extract it; but if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is thus.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of Indian steel, very sharp at the end.
And let your cutting, by which you cut it, be done over many days, because of the hardness of the tooth and so that another tooth is not moved.
But if it is prominent and suitable for filing, then file it with a file from India, whose form is thus.
It is entirely from India and its handle is of very small points, like the file with which needles are made: by which the tooth is filed little by little over many days easily, so that the tooth does not move, and falls; then smooth it, in the end scrape it with certain rasps.
If it is a tooth, from which a piece breaks off and injures the tongue, then one must smooth it also, until the roughness of that break is removed, and made even, and smoothed, so that it does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
About pulling teeth with gold wire.
When a shock and blow happens to the front teeth from a strike or accident, and the patient cannot hold together what they eat so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but the cure has not been effective, then there is skill in this: to tie them with gold wire. For silver turns green and putrefies after days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be medium in fineness and thickness according to what fits between the teeth.
And the form of the pulling is thus: take a wire and insert its double between two sound teeth; then weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you come with the thread to the sound tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving back to the part where you began; and hold your hand with fineness and wisdom, until it is not at all removed; and let your constriction by which you tie the wire be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape.
Then cut the superfluous ends of the wire with scissors; and gather together both [ends] and turn them with a pincer; and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be left thus tied as long as it remains.
But if it loosens or is cut, tie them with another wire, and they will remain thus for the entire time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the pulling of two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the incident and remain there as we have said; only a skilled and experienced craftsman can accomplish this.
And sometimes a piece of cattle bone is prepared: it is shaped like a tooth and placed in the socket, where it is secured and fastened as we said: and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either congenital, with which a person is born, or acquired, from an old healed wound.
And the operation on it is this: open the mouth of the patient, placing his head in your lap and raise his tongue; then cut through that nerve-like ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its constriction.
But if there is some hardness and knotting due to the healed wound, then thrust a hook into it and search through its width until you cut the ligament and free the knot.
And be careful not to make a deep flesh cut and sever an artery there, causing blood flow.
Then wash the site of the incision with rose water or vinegar or cold water. 
Then place a linen cloth under the tongue which the patient must hold every night: so that it does not heal again.
But if there is bleeding, then put ground alum on the site. But if the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize the site with a suitable cautery; then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he is cured.
Chapter 35
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.
And the procedure for this is to open the mouth of the patient facing the sun and observe the abscess.
If therefore you see it to be a dark or black color, hard, and the patient feels no pain from it; then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
And if it is inclined towards whiteness and has moisture; then insert a hook into it and cut it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from all parts. But if blood overcomes you during your procedure, then place ground cumin on it until the bleeding stops; then return to your procedure until you extract it with its entirety.
Then let it be rinsed with vinegar and salt; and care for the remainder of the appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of abscesses in the two tonsils.
Chapter 36
Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat and tonsils, which resemble cotton balls that appear externally; these are called two tonsils. When you treat them with what we have said about incision and they do not heal, then observe.
If therefore the abscess is hard, dark in color, and causes little pain; then do not touch it with an iron (scalpel).
And if it is red in color and its root is thick; then do not touch it even with an iron, fearing excessive bleeding. Rather, leave it until it matures. 》 And then either you will pierce it or it will burst by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is fine; then you should cut into it.
And the procedure is as follows: consider before the operation whether the abscess has become hot and filled with quietness, or if it has diminished somewhat. Then have the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should be in your lap. Open his mouth, and let the servant take him between his hands, and press his tongue downward with this instrument.
Let it be made of silver or bronze, which should be as thin as a knife.
So when you press it against the tongue, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and insert it into the tonsil, and draw it out as far as possible to the exterior, except that you pull some of the membranes with it.  />
Then cut it with an instrument of this form which follows. It resembles scissors; however, its extremities should be curved so that the opening of each one is directly at the tip of the other. Therefore, ensure that it is made of Indian steel or steel that has been quenched in oil.
But if this instrument is not available, then cut it with a spatula of this form. Let one end be sharp, the other not.
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in a similar manner.
Then, after the cutting, let the patient gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
But if bleeding occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves and other hemostatics similar to them, until the flow of blood is stopped; then care for him until he heals.
And sometimes abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils. Cut them therefore as I said for the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have treated a woman from an abscess that had developed in her throat, which was pulling it to darkness, with little sensation and had almost closed her throat; and the woman was breathing through narrowed breath, and it had already prevented her from eating food or drinking water; and she would have reached death if it had remained for one day or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches until they emerged at the two nostrils.
I hastened quickly, therefore, and fixed a hook into one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large piece was drawn out from it.
Then I cut it off where it was caught in the nostril. ️
Then I did to her what had emerged from the other nostril's opening.
Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess itself; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood ran out from it; thus the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period; and the abscess followed in the place where I had cut, until it was greatly elongated with her.
Therefore, I cauterized the abscess in the throat.
It stopped growing further; then I left her and did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ On the incision of the abscess on the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When the cold (catarrh) descends to the uvula and becomes abscessed and is long; then it is called "perpendicular". And if it is thick and round at its lower part, then it is called "grape".
When it is treated with what we mentioned during the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot tumor has subsided from it, and is thin: then you must cut into it.
And if something round has grown from it, and it has no length, and is red or dark in color, and there is no sensation in it: then you should avoid cutting into it. For there is fear regarding the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the way I said, from its whiteness and length, make the patient sit before the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument that preceded in the narrative; afterwards, insert a hook into the vein and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.
And you should not cut from it except what is added beyond the natural limit without adding to it.
For if you cut more than this, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the cutting, use that which we have mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened by the cutting, then you should use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cautery for it is not except with sharp water; and it is that you place the patient's head on your lap. Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned. Then take from the water that I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and make a cup of it that is not extinguished, and place it not thick nor thin, and fill with it the hollow of this instrument, whose form is this.
Let its end where the medicine is placed have a concavity like the concavity of a spoon.
And place the instrument with medicine on the wound itself; and let the patient lie on their side, so that saliva may flow from their mouth due to the internal medicine, lest anything should descend into the throat and harm them.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you should place it on the wound for half an hour, until you see that it has turned black and the grinding of the medicine is calmed.
And if you wish to use cotton, roll it around the tip of a finger and soak it with medicine. Then insert the finger along with the cotton into a small tube, until the cotton adheres to the wound.
Do this many times, until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the wound. Then leave it; for it dries up and falls off after three or four days.
If you need to renew the medicine, renew it; and after cauterizing, clean around the wound with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse it with what remains of the medicine around it, and rinse with cold water.
And let it be scraped externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This method of treatment is therefore healthier for the cut and further from danger.
And sometimes the wound is also treated with something even more delicate than cautery and incision; it is treated with fumigation in this manner. Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, marjoram, chamomile, southernwood, and similar herbs; gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged in vinegar and boil; and let the pot be well sealed with clay; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which place a concave instrument in this manner.
"Make from silver or copper and insert the end with the pellet into the patient's mouth until steam rises to the lips above the tube until the lips are much darkened.
Then repeat over it many times until it dries out.
And beware not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival. For it often adds to the swelling, and it is not fitting that you do this except at the decline of its heat.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube and place on its end the shell of an egg so that the patient's mouth does not burn, for the eggshell prevents the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with safety.
§ On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat
Chapter 38
Many times a bone or a fishbone sticks in the throat, or something else.
Therefore, you must extract whatever is apparent from these things after pressing the tongue with the instrument toward the light, and it will be revealed to you what is in the throat.
And whatever does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food settles in the stomach.  /> For perhaps the stuck object will come out with the vomit.
Or the patient may swallow a piece of bread, or a lettuce root, or a dry crumb of bread; or he may take a gentle piece of dry sea sponge and tie it on a thread, then swallow it.  />  /> When it reaches the place where the thorns or bone are and they are drawn out, then it comes out.  />  />
If it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead in this shape.  />  /> 
"The ulcer is larger than the radius for a short time, and at its end there is curvature, which it enters into its throat with ease; and he should have his head raised up.
"And he should beware of the touch of his epiglottis, lest coughing happen to him; and he should expel with it a bone or a thorn, or the physician should insert it with his own hand.
"But what the sick person inserts is better: because of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached; and he should expel it downwards, or draw up his hand with the instrument, all of it according to its quantity which has been prepared for him, until it comes out.
"About the Extraction of a Leech
Chapter 39
"When a leech is treated with what I said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the presence of sunlight or in sunlight after you press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
"If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with fine tweezers.
"But if it is not possible with them, then take a hollow reed and insert it into the patient's throat until it reaches the leech; then insert into the hollow of the reed a heated iron with fire. "Do this many times, and let the patient abstain from water all day.
"Then let the patient take a drink of cold water and open his mouth wide over it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, but not swallow any of it; and move the water in one hour after another with his hand." ・ "For a leech immediately falls when it feels water.
"But if it does not come out with what I have told you, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with anise using the instrument that I described for fumigating the throat.
This is often the case, since it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is as follows: take a pot in which there are live coals with fire, and let the pot be covered with a cover, in whose middle there is an opening; and arrange in that opening the end of the instrument.
Then pour the fumigation and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the tube and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech. For the leech will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst and eat salted and garlic foods, and not drink water.
It is therefore necessary that it will exit with this diet.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat when it falls upon the very sight.
It is similar to tongs, as you see: except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat. And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, on which there is the roughness of a file; when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
§ On the opening and sectioning of apostemes, and their general care.
Chapter 40.
There are many kinds of apostemes, of various types, as will be recalled in this book; and there are two ways to open them and cut them out.
One is from the nature of the aposteme itself, and from that which it contains of humors. ️
And the second method is because of the places in the body where they occur.
Because an aposteme occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus; and an aposteme occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring in joints; and each of them has its own judgment based on their location.
And of aposteme (abscess) there are those which should not be pierced unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion; and there are those which should be pierced while they are fresh and do not mature according to their due course.
Like apostemes (abscesses) that are close to joints.
For an apostema (abscess) that occurs near a joint and its duration is prolonged until it putrefies, which is in its circumference, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is the cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or it is an aposteme (abscess) in the main limb; for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that or the main limb itself.
Or it is near the anus; therefore, perforate it while it is immature and not fully digested, except for a raw aposteme (abscess), unless it is near the anus so that it does not putrefy deep and reach the interior of the anus and become a fistula, or end in something that does not heal. 》
You should know the hour of perforating an aposteme (abscess) that has matured according to its course; and it is at the remission of pain, the subsiding of fever, and the diminishing of redness, pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and other signs. 》 》
And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the aposteme (abscess) and in the more prominent swelling; and the perforation should go along the length of the body if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the upper arms, tendons, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those that are reflected, proceed with a perforation along that membrane.
When, however, the abscess is in fleshy parts: then it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said at the end.
For if you perforate it beforehand, the course of the discharge from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and filthiness, and perhaps its edges become hardened, and its depth.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body as needed, or according to what that part requires.
And you should administer a small perforation for small abscesses and a large perforation or multiple cuts similar to the size of the abscess for large ones.
And there are abscesses for which the skin must be hollowed out and cut when it has already been made like a cloth and its end has died, as often happens with doublets and buboes.
And among them are those that are cut with a three-angled incision. And among them is the one that is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And among them are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones from other incisions, are administered.  />
However, that which has no head, like the soft and superficial abscesses, should be perforated with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And when the abscess is thick and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a part of it from it. Then pack the abscess until another day. Then extract something from the pus again.
Do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person: for the vital spirit of the animal is often resolved from the animal with the coming out of the pus; and perhaps the patient will die, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, beware this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these boils, it is necessary that you clean the wound; and be careful. If therefore the boil is small, or if it is a flat section, then apply dressings of linen, or old cotton. And if the boil is large, and there are many fissures from the perforations, it is necessary then to insert a dressing into each fissure, until they come together.
And if in the boil you have cut off a part of the skin, or concaved it around; then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton, or as when a cloth is woven, or shorn of linen wool without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then discard it, and treat it with that which is necessary from an ointment, until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has soaked in them: and place it on the site of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer a regimen and care and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in the section on division.
But if it is during the winter and the site of the boil is of many nerves; then it is necessary that you pour hot powders with wine and oil on them: and place them on the sites.
And if it is summer and the places are fleshy: then you should place small cloths soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold. Until the third day, as we said, then you should release the abscess and cleanse it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Therefore, this is what is necessary for the universal knowledge of the treatment of abscesses.
According to the second half of the division, I have already spoken about every abscess, how there is a way to its cure individually and in chapters.
Chapter 41.
¶ About the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Abscesses occur on the skin of the head and are small in size; they are of the type called nodules, enclosed by tunics which are bags for them, as if they were eggs of a hen.
And their types are many.
Among them are fatty ones; and among them are those that contain a moisture like clay; and among them are those that contain a moisture like crushed grains or poultices, and similar substances; and among them are hard stony ones.
And in the incision of all of these and their removal there is no danger, as long as during their incision a vein does not cause a contrary action.
And the operation in their incision is as follows: you should test them with an instrument, whose form will be shown afterwards, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if that which it contains is moisture, then cut it with a lengthwise incision with a shallow incision in this manner.
And begin with the incision from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture has been evacuated, then remove the bag that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
Indeed, it often returns if something of it remains.
Then submerge the cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day. For it will eat away what remains of the tumor.
Then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment on the cotton a second and third time, and if necessary, continue doing so until you are confident that nothing remains of the tumor; then treat the wound with the ointment until it heals.
If the tumor contains a fatty lump, then cut it in the following manner, making a cross-shaped incision; and throw away the hooks between the edges of the incision, and excise it from all sides; and strive with your skill to extract the membrane that contains it.
But if a blood vessel opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
And do likewise with a stone-like tumor, through incision and the same treatment, as we have said.
The incision on a stone-like tumor is easier, for it has little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are certain of these tumors which are on the head in some people, and with which there is no moisture at all.
Which is to say: for I incised a tumor on the head of an old woman, and found the tumor like a solid, hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if anyone struck it by throwing something at it, they would wound themselves.
But in other tumors occurring on the head, besides these particular tumors which occur on children's heads and at the roots of the ears, the incision for all of them should be a superficial one.
Place the perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the course of the pus is relieved to the lower part.
Then treat it with what suits them from the treatment.
§ On the incision of abscesses in the neck.
Chapter 42.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And among those that occur in the neck are one and many; and they generate from each other; and every abscess among them is within its own proper tunic, just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said. 》
And there are many types of these abscesses. Among them are stony ones, and among them are those that contain liquids, and among them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, when you see one among them that is of good disposition by touch, whose appearance is close to the color of the skin and moves toward every part, and which is not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the windpipe nor to the artery, and is not deep; it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b. to line g., and excoriate it from all sides; and spread the two lips of the skin with hooks or with many hooks if you need them, as we have said regarding the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is cautious to ensure that no vein or nerve is cut.
And let the knife not be very sharp, so that it does not make your hand slip during the incision or trouble the patient, and you do not cut what is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein or artery and it prevents you from operating, then place ground-up gum or certain powders that curdle the blood in the wound, and bind the wound, and leave it alone until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens; or it begins to want to putrefy. 》 》 》
And the blood is cut off by the tunica. Return then to your operation until you complete it.
Then explore with your index finger if there is any remnant of other small strophulae: cut them and clean them out.
If the strophula is rooted in a large vein, you should not cut it from its root. Instead, bind it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for him (the patient).
If the entire strophula is cut off, you should gather together the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately, after seeing that there is no longer any excess fluid.
However, if you see that there is still excess fluid due to the size of the strophula, you should then aim to cut its root and remove it; and apply the suture as we have said.
And those strophulae which contain humors should be perforated with a superficial perforation, so that the place of their maturity may appear to you; and make the perforation towards what is below in the body, as we have said.
Then after perforation, apply linen with ointment and similar things so that it may consume what remains of the corruption; and when you see that the wound is already clean, then care for him with a flesh-generating ointment until he heals.
Chapter 43.
About the incision of the epiglottis due to an abscess happening within the throat.
The ancients spoke of this incision of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it; and this is their written account. 》
In those who have a hernia, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided, as it will not be helpful; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or on both tonsils, when there is no pain in the throat, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis to avoid death from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circular ridges of the epiglottis with a small incision in width between two ridges so that the incision is in cartilage, not in bone: and this place is suitable for incision because it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
If the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook. Then let him prick the skin until he reaches the throat; avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Then let him cut the cartilage as we have described; and it is indicated over the incision of the throat from the mucus that comes out of it, with what is broken, and loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour approaches in which one fears suffocation, join the two lips of the skin wound, or just the skin alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that promote tissue growth until it heals.
Said Al-Zahrawi. The summary of the discussion we have presented is this: its explanation is only when they see that any one of these abscesses has filled the throat of the sick person and lifted him up to death, and he wishes to cut off his breath, they go to cut the epiglottis so that the sick person breathes over the place of the wound with a certain breath and is saved from death. And for this reason they commanded that the wound be left open until the wickedness of the illness is consumed, and its wickedness lasts three days or thereabouts; then they commanded to close the wound and heal it until it heals. ">
And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the lung's passageway.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning as if she were dying.
Therefore, I untied from the wound, and I found blood that had come out of the small wound. So I became certain that she herself had not cut a vein or artery; and air was coming out of the wound.  \\
So I hastened and sutured the wound and treated it until it was healed; and nothing else happened to the maidservant except for hoarseness of voice, and after a few days she returned to her usual state.
Therefore I say that in cutting the epiglottis there is no danger.
¶ On the incision of a neck hernia.
Chapter 44
This swelling called a neck hernia is a large swelling the color of flesh, and it occurs frequently in women.
And there are two types: either it is natural or it is acquired.
In the natural type, certainly there is no intelligence.
The acquired type, however, occurs in two ways; one of which is similar to fatty knots.  /// And the other type is similar to the swelling that results from the knotting of an artery.  /// And there is danger in it, and one should not presume to cut into it with an iron except when it is small; and you should test it and examine it with a probe. If you find it similar to a fatty knot and not attached to any veins, then cut into it as one cuts a knot; and extract it with what it contains from the sac, if it is in a sac; and if not, then examine its entirety. Then care for the place with what is necessary from the treatment until it heals.
Chapter 45.
Of the section on swollen lumps.
There are many kinds of swollen lumps, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary that I describe here the difference between a swollen lump and an abscess, since there is doubt about it.
I say therefore that when it is an abscess, there is heat, fever, and severe pain until the bubbling of the superfluity settles down and the putrefaction is completed; then indeed the fever and heat subside.
But when it is a swollen lump, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and a kistis called sifachin contains them, which is their proper sac, and it is according to the color of the body; and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a watermelon, larger or smaller. ︎
And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a swollen lump, you should examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to its form which will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
And the way of investigating all swollen lumps and tumors is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part that you find in the swelling; and you should turn your fingers with it little by little, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin. Then you should place your hand according to the size of the swelling.
Then remove the Intromissum and examine what comes out in its wake.
If therefore a running moisture comes out, whatever its color may be, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I said in other swellings. ︎ ︎
And if the moisture does not exit the wound after the insertion, then you should know that it is fatty: therefore, cut above it with a cross-shaped incision as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and strip away the skin from all sides easily; and preserve kistin over it, if you can, so that you may extract it healthy with a knot.
But if the kist [cyst] bursts during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if any part of it, whether small or large, remains, the swelling will return to a great extent.
But if you are overcome and some part of it remains; then fill the wound at its conclusion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and bind the wound, and place a hot poultice over it, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Therefore, if it is a large swelling, then either separate its two lips, and treat it with what makes it heal.
But if the vein is contrary to you, either pulsating or non-pulsating; then hurry and fill the place with ground zegh [a type of plant], and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of the blood ceases; then return to cutting what remains of the swelling.
Chapter 46.
¶ On external instruments for cutting and piercing.
From these are the forms of Intromission, and they are of three types.
Of these there is a large one, and of these there is a medium one, and of these there is a small one.
They should be made from square-ended iron files, so that they may hasten entry into the cyst.
And these are the forms of Surgeries, that is, incisions; and one of them is called beriś, that is, incision; and there are three types.
For among them there is the large, the middle, and the small.
They are suitable for investigating through them boils, excretions, fistulas, and abscesses that are between the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which upholstery is sewn, that is, from brass or iron or silver.
And the best of them are those made of brass.
And surgeries are also made of black lead, which are suitable for examining through them fistulas that have hollows, so that they may be examined with their gentleness and those hollows. 》
And again, there are three types. For from them there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
The form of incisions, and they are of many types.
For from them there are simple ones, that is, those which have one curve; and they are of three types as you see: large, medium, and small.
And from them are blind incisions, and they are of three types.
And from them are incisions having two curves, and they are of three types; and from them are incisions having three curves, and they are of three types; and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and boils are cut and scraped; and they are of three types, for from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Their ends with which the section is made are sharp; their other ends are not sharp. And they are not placed thus except so that through them help may be given in the scraping of nodes because of the fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the sick person may be healed through them, and may find temporary relief from the burning which is found in the scraping of the boil. 》 》
They are made of air and resemble a ray with which alcohol is made. At the end of its broad tip there are hidden punctual points; through these it runs to the inside or the outside as you wish, just as you see.
The form of the hidden Spatumilium between the fingers in the perforation of the aposteme, and the weak do not perceive them; they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.
The shapes of the Ventosarum with which the flow of blood is cut off; they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.
They are made of air or citron wood, round and somewhat long, as you see, and should be very fine.
And it is necessary for you to have these large and small shapes of the Ventosarum, so that you may quickly cut off blood through them in an emergency when there is no medicine present.
However, do not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshy places, such as the thighs of the leg and hip, the upper arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar fleshy parts that are moist.
And sometimes from them are made other small instruments similar to the rinds of figs, according to their shape; with these blood is cut off when it flows from a place of venesection or from an incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this form.
Chapter 47.
¶ On the treatment of the breasts of humans which resemble the breasts of women.
Sometimes the breasts of certain people swell at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted during sleep), until they resemble the breasts of women; and they remain hideously inflamed.  />
He who dislikes it should cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision according to this diagram from line b to line g. Then remove all the fat. Afterwards, fill the wound with an incarnative medicine. Then join the two lips of the wound together with a stitch and care for it until it heals.
But if the breast descends lower and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then one should make two crescent-shaped incisions on both of its upper sides, each joined with the other at both ends until a larger line encloses a smaller one, according to this diagram from line b to line g. Then remove the skin that is between the two lips, and take away the fat, and do as we said about the stitching and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals.
But if you do not complete the incision as you should due to the patient's restlessness or heavy bleeding: then you should fill the wound with cotton wool soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it has dissolved whatever fat remains. Then care for him until he heals.
¶ On the piercing of an abscess that occurs under the nipple.
Chapter XLVIII.
These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of the hard species of strophulae, which contain a bladder, and there are those among them which contain liquids.
Therefore, those which contain liquids should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision according to this form, from line b to line g. And when all that is in the abscess has been evacuated through pus, then fill it with old cotton wool and leave it until another day.
Then remove the bandage and clean with a suitable ointment until it heals.
If the abscess is of the kind called strophular nodes, then cut it open as we said in the section on equal cuts for strophular nodes.
If, however, the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, as we said in what was mentioned before.
Chapter XLIX.
¶ About the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and a vein.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it heals, then frequently an abscess occurs from there; and similarly this happens with a vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is recognized that an abscess and swelling are because of an artery and a vein are: because, when the abscess is because of an artery, it is long and deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a sound.  />
And that which is because of a vein is round and evident on the body.
And an incision over this abscess is dangerous, especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very great. Therefore, its treatment with a knife should be avoided, and those that are also in the limbs or head, their treatment should be avoided as well.
Therefore, for those caused by swelling of an artery opening, seek the cut along the length of the skin. Then open the cut with forceps, then the artery; and free it from its coatings until it is exposed.  />  />  />
Then insert a needle under it and make it pass to the other side; and bind the artery with double thread in two places, as I taught you in the removal of the two temporal arteries.  />  />
Then pierce the place that is between the two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood comes out of it and the abscess is dissolved.
Then apply a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards, treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the abscess is due to a cut vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as possible. Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you extract it from the other side. Then bind the abscess with a good ligature, as I have told you for the ligature of the grape, on both sides with the two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread might be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess near the first needle's incision; press and bind your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in half until what is inside comes out; then cut away the excess skin and leave whatever has been bound from it.
Then place upon it a little piece of wool that you have soaked in wine and oil. Then apply treatment with poultices and ointments until it heals.
Chapter L.
¶ About the abscess that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves; this happens to them from blows or from excessive labor and similar things, and it occurs most often in the joints of the fingers or toes, and in any place where there is movement of the joints. And this is a grave abscess.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many states without pain; but when squeezed firmly, the patient feels a sensation like numbness in it.
And there is no abscess deep within the body, but rather it is under the skin, and the entire thing can be moved in any direction; it does not go to the front or back towards the anterior or posterior parts.
Therefore, if something of this kind is in a joint, it should not be approached with iron. For perhaps contraction might occur.
As for what is of this kind in the head or forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel. If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
If it is large, then hang it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it, and close the wound with stitches: and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LII.
¶ On the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
There are certain people who often have lumps in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, which are called fungalia due to their similarity to mushrooms. ‌ ‌
Whose roots are fine, and whose heads are thick, and their lips are inverted. Some of them are small; others become very large.
I myself have seen a man who had two such lumps in his belly, which were more like mushrooms than anything else; there was no difference between them, they were white and with fine roots, their lips were inverted, and pus always flowed from them. ‌
I cut them open and found that one weighed about eight and a half ounces, the other about six ounces. And the operation for cutting into them is this: If the patient is humid and the color of the lump is white, watery, with fine roots, then cut it with a broad scalpel, and let cauteries be at hand in the fire.
Often much blood is expelled during its incision; therefore hasten if you are overcome by the blood and then cauterize it.
And if you see the patient weak, fearful and timid of the incision with iron, then take a thread well-made from lead, and string it through the athelul; its method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the constriction of the lead. Do not therefore cease tying the lead whenever it is impressed upon the thelil, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
But if the thelil is of a thick root, then there is something fearful and terrifying in its incision, especially what is in the abdomen.
However, it is possible that you may incise half of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then take care of it until the wound heals.
And beware of presuming to incise a thelil that is of a dark color, insensitive, and foul in appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess. And I will deal with the topic of Cancer after this.
Chapter LII.
¶ On treating a protruding umbilicus.
An umbilical hernia can occur for many reasons. Or from a tearing of the diaphragm above the abdomen; and either an altub or intestine comes out of it, as happens in other cases of rupture. ➤ Or from blood flowing from a vein or an artery, as was previously stated. Or from constipation constrained within it.
If however it is due to a tearing of the diaphragm and the exiting of intestines; then its color is similar to that of the body; and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in various places. ➤ ➤ And if it is due to the prolapse of the intestine, then its condition, as we have narrated, is of a more intense variety. So when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance to the bath, and it is very troublesome.
But if it is due to moisture, it is gentle; then when you press it with your hand, it does not become hidden, nor constrained, nor increased.
But if it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears, turning black at the clavicle.
But if it is due to dead flesh, then the abscess is heavy, thick, hard, and it settles into one location.
But if it is due to flatulence, then its touch is gentle.
And the operation in it is such that you should then consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or flatulence; then you must abstain from its treatment. For there is fear and danger in it, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses due to an artery or vein.
But if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestine or bladder, then you must advise the patient to hold his breath and stand upright and extended. Then mark with cautery the entire area around the navel. After that, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands. Then surround the area around the navel with a wide bandage over the place that you marked with cautery. After that, extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook.  \\ Then bind it tightly around its circumference with thread or strong silk cord, and let the knot be an Alexandrian knot.
Then open the middle of the swelling extended above the ligament. If therefore you find that the intestine has already been caught by the ligament, then extract the hernia, and introduce your index finger into it, and push the intestine back towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find the cecum, then take hold of it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
But if it is the opposite for you, that is, if it is an artery or vein, then encircle it much [with thread]. Then return to your work. And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, causing them to penetrate.
Then tie the swelling in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh has rotted and falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Then treat him with the necessary ointments until he is healed.
But if the swelling of the navel is from soft flesh or from moisture, then you should hollow out the swelling as we have said. And extract the blood, or the moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat him with that which will consolidate the place.
Chapter Fifty-Three
About the treatment of Cancers.
We have already spoken in the division of the kinds of Cancer, and how is the way to its treatment with medicines; and one must guard against its ulcerating with the iron during its treatment: and we have said that if a Cancer has been generated in the womb, one must take care in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes a Cancer is in a place where it is possible for it to be eradicated; such as a Cancer which is in the breasts or in the thigh, and similar places on the body, especially when it is small and just beginning.
When it is old and large, you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to heal anyone with it; nor did I see anyone before me who reached that point.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is such that you should precede and dissolve the patient from black bile often. Then perform a phlebotomy on him if you find clear evidence of fullness.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation that is appropriate for the operation.
Then cast into the Cancer the curved hooks that are suitable for it. Then hollow it out completely with the skin from every side, according to your examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, but press on the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or whatever possible instrument is there.
But if the flow of thick blood from the cutting of an artery or vein causes you difficulty, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.  /> And it should not be done on a young person except for necessity.  /> And this is what we have written about it. Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
§ On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter LIV. We have already explained in the division of the kinds of dropsy and how water accumulates; and the signs of every kind, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only the kind of ascites alone; and it does not approach the kind of tympanites with iron, nor the kind of hypoascites at all; for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this kind of dropsy tympanites with medicines, and your treatment did not help; then consider. For if the patient has already become weakened or there is another illness with him besides the dropsy, such as if he has a cough or loose bowels and similar to those; then beware lest you treat him with iron; for there is danger in that.
If however you see the patient with an abundance of vigor, and besides hydropsy alone there is no other illness with him, and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the manner of operating on him is for you to lift the patient standing between your hands, and an assistant behind him should press his belly with his hand, forcing water down to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a thorny sponge, in this shape. Let it be of two sharp ends, long, with a sharp tip like a thorny sponge. However, there should be something of shortness to it gradually, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and damage it.
Then pay attention. For if the hydropsy is generated from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with a cut from the navel by three fingers, to the lower part of it directly above the chest.
However if the hydropsy is generated because of an illness of the liver, then your cut should be on the left from the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let there be a cut on the right side: and it is not necessary that there also be a cut on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument. Then introduce into that cut, and lift your hand with the thorny sponge under the skin, as if you were scraping it off: and let the amount that is scraped be the size of a nail or about that.
Then pierce with the sifac, until the thorny sponge reaches the empty place: and it is a place of water. Then extract it, and introduce into the opening an instrument, the shape of which is this. And it is similar to a reed: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth and clean; at its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is cut according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately sinks onto the instrument; therefore evacuate half the amount of water in an hour.
Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, then perhaps the patient will die within the hour due to the loss of his vital spirit; or a fainting spell will occur which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the measure of its power, and according to what the condition of the patient indicates to you by the strength of his pulse, and by his good state.
Then remove the instrument, and keep the water.
This is because it is immediately retained due to the skin which holds closed the hole that is above the syphon; concerning which I have said that you should pierce it in this manner.
Then repeat the use of the instrument on the following day, if you see that the patient is able to tolerate it; and also evacuate a small amount of water.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error; until there remains only a little water.
But if you are afraid for the patient and let out a large amount of water, then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait for him to be thirsty: and care for him with drying medicines until he is cured; and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after the evacuation of water, as I have said in what preceded.
¶ On the care of infants who are born with their bladder not being pierced.
**Chapter 55**
When a child exits its mother's womb, and the fontanelle of its head is not open, or it is too narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Therefore, one must immediately help with a fine, very small curette upon its birth, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead plug into the opening and bind it: and keep it there for three days or four.
When the child wants to pass urine, remove it and let it urinate.  ?> Then put it back in place.
And if you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will prevent it from closing up.
As for the one whose fontanelle is too narrow, he should be treated with lead as we said, over many days, until it widens.
But those in whom the fontanelle is not in its proper place are harmed. This is because in those who are born, the fontanelle is at the end of the head's neck: therefore they cannot urinate towards the front until they raise their neck with their hand to a higher position. And there is no offspring for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight path: and this is a very foul disease.  > 1062485736
And the method of treatment for him is that the sick person be placed on his back. Then extend the neck of his head with your left hand using strong traction. And cut the top of the neck from the area of the penis, with a needle or a sharp curette, like you would incise a reed, or as if you were cutting something until the middle comes out similar to the top of the neck: and let the opening fall in the middle as is appropriate.  > 1062485736
And beware of bleeding during your procedure. For it often happens thus. Therefore apply to it that which restrains the blood and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ Concerning abscesses that occur on the prepuce and the glans, and their corruption, blackness, and adherence.
Chapter 61.
Often these abscesses occur on the penis, and it has an ugly protuberance of flesh.  />
And from this [type], one is malignant and another is not malignant.
Therefore you should suspend the non-malignant one with a fine hook and cut it off until you cleanse it completely. Then place a soaked bandage in Egyptian ointment on top of it. Then care for the same [place] after that with diacathym-ointment until it heals.
If the abscess is malignant and of an ugly color, then you should apply a cautery to it after its incision and its removal.  />   
But if the abscess is on the prepuce of an uncircumcised man and there is a part of the abscess between the prepuce and outside it: then you should first remove the internal part of the abscess until it heals, and then care for the external [part], because when you care for both at once, the prepuce will not be preserved but will be cut off.   
And now they also occur in the testicles and the prepuce with blackness and corruption. Therefore, you should cut out everything that is already turning black and wants to become corrupted, or has already become corrupted.     
Then bandage the same [place] after that with honey that has already been stirred with sieved grain flour and finely ground herbs.       
Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if there is bleeding, then administer a cautery using a lunar cautery, in this manner.
For the cautery is beneficial for two conditions at once: namely, for bleeding and when a wound becomes corrupt.
If the head of the virga is corroded and completely destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead pipe into the meatus of the priapus so that the patient urinates on it.
However, if the foreskin adheres to the head of the virga and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for him, sometimes it happens due to a wound or an aposteme; therefore, it is necessary that you scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the virga is freed from every part.  />
If it is difficult to distinguish these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape off some of the head of the virga and the foreskin. Which is because a thin foreskin may perhaps be perforated quickly due to its own thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the virga with a thin cloth that has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then it should be cared for with stiptic wine until it heals.
Chapter 57
¶ Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of their mistaken conditions.
Circumcision is not a dissolution of continuity, like other wounds; nevertheless, since it is our operation, by our will, and its use is proper for boys, it is necessary that we mark this operation with something better, and find an easier way leading to health.
I therefore say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws, and we have only learned about it through experience.
And this is because I have found that the majority of craftsmen and bloodletters use cleansing by cutting with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery and ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and ligation with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes (i.e., is cut too deeply). Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore it may happen that the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains intact; thus an incision is necessary to cut the other, which will cause pain. And with cleansing that is done by cautery, which is what shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the male member is not secured because perhaps it may enter its opening.
But in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron may slip and spoil your work; and indeed the child's skin is naturally short, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this.
But cleansing with scissors and ligation with thread has shown me to be a good experiment because the scissors are of an appropriate size for the incision; therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below. ️ Therefore when you press with your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned and they cut at the same time according to one operation; and a similar-shaped compression is made, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
And the method of operation is to cause the child, especially if he understands a little, to think that you are not doing anything except tying a string on his stick; and let him go until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be merry in every way possible for you to do so, according to his understanding. Then make him stand between your prepared hands, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Then insert your hand towards his stick and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the stick comes out. Then cleanse it because filth accumulates in it.
Then bind the marked place with double thread. Afterwards, bind a little lower the second ligature. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature firmly, and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and remove the head of the stick. Then allow the blood to flow slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top; and on the powder a cloth in which a cooked egg yolk has been spread with fresh good rose oil, shaken together; and leave it on him until another day; and take care of him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
The form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows:
The two ends should be blunt and should not be sharp; so that the nail-pin does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
The mistake that occurs in cleansing is if perhaps the entire inner skin or a part of it escapes during the incision.
"Therefore, you should stretch it with your nail from the hour when the tumor appears and cut it according to its size.
"If you cannot hold it with your nail, then remove it with a hook and cut it.
"But if three days have passed and the swelling remains under the rod inflated as an abscess, then leave it until the abscess becomes hot and incised with ease. Then cut it according to how you are prepared, and be careful of the head of the rod. "For this will not harm it.
"So take care of it with the powder that consolidates the wound from the powders which we have mentioned in the section on powders; and if the cut extends beyond the skin and reaches the higher parts, this will not harm him either.
"So take care of it with what we have said until it heals.
Chapter 58
"Concerning the removal of retained urine from the bladder.
"Retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to a stone formed from a pebble or congealed blood, pus, flesh growths, and similar substances which we have mentioned earlier among the methods of treatment in the section on division.
"And if the urine does not dissolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it should be made to sit with its knees bent. "Then let his feet be placed on his back and let him stretch out his stomach over the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as he can. "And so the stone in the bladder neck is forced to expel towards the rear, thus the urine is released.
"But if it does not dissolve with what we have said and the case is severe for the patient, then you must administer its removal with an instrument called a syringe, which has this shape. It should be made of silver and be fine, smooth, and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather in delicacy, as long as one and a half palms. At its tip it should have a fine tube.
And the method of exit of urine through it is to take a doubled thread, and tie a wool or cotton wick at its end with a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off any excess from the wool with scissors, but insert it into the tube forcefully, as with alzer.
Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white: and have the patient sit on a seat, and pierce the bladder, and its tube with wet oils and olive oil and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the tube easily until it reaches the base of the tube.
Then double it above the navel.
Then press the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached an empty space: and this is not done in this order, except because the passage through which it passes is one with a twist.
Then gradually extend the thread with the wool. For urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out and let the urine flow through its natural pathway: and repeat with the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ On the Method of Enema for the Bladder using a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
When there occurs an ulcer in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or pus thickens in it, and it is necessary to instill waters and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed. And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.  /> ¶ De forma Clepshydrae.
And the hollow place, which contains that which propels, should be according to its size without addition, until when it is drawn with something, water is drawn; and when it is propelled, it expels with it to a distance, just as the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
Therefore, when you wish to throw the liquids into a bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the liquid and draw with it that which propels upward, for then the liquid is drawn into the hollow of the clepsydra.
Then introduce its end into a tube, as we have described with the syringe. Then propel the liquid with that which propels, for then the liquid immediately reaches the bladder so that the patient feels it.
The form of a fine enema to irrigate the bladder.
It should be made of silver or copper: whose head is similar to a small alchemist's still and beneath it there is a pouch into which the string falls.  (Or: ... whose head is shaped like a small alembic, and below it there is a pouch into which the string descends.)
Then take the bladder of a ram and place it in that liquid with which you wish to irrigate the bladder. Then tie it strongly between two pouches with a double thread, and heat that liquid slightly over the fire.  (Or: ... between two bags with a strong double thread, and heat that liquid for a little while on the fire.)
Then introduce the end of the enema into a tube; afterward, place your hand on the bladder with the liquid until you feel it tight enough, so that the patient feels that this liquid has now reached the bladder.
If however you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it and pierce it from all its circumference. Then introduce a thread fortunately in those openings, as they roll around. Then make a circle like an embroiderer does: after you have placed upon it what you wish from the moist substances, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it onto the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder for emptying with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60
§ About extracting a stone.
I have already spoken in the division of the types of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I stated the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and all the signs of that; and I spoke about the stone on which manual operation and incision are effective: it is properly a stone generated in the bladder, and one that becomes fixed in the shaft; and I am explaining this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder occurs most often in boys.
And its signs are that the urine exits from the bladder like water in its fineness; and there appears white sand in it; and the patient rubs his shaft, and struggles with it, and often it hangs down. Then he erects [his penis], and exits with it the anus in many of them.
And treatment for boys is easy, until they reach fourteen years [of age]. And it is difficult in the elderly. But in young men it is moderate, in that it is between [those two]: and for someone whose stone is larger, the treatment is easier; but if small, then its care is the opposite. ›
Therefore, when we have come to treatment, it is first necessary to purify the patient with an enema, which removes all the excrement that is in his intestines; for this itself sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone upon investigation.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved towards the lower part: so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or jump from a high place several times.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his knees, so that the entire bladder may become sloping downwards towards the lower part.
Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
If therefore you feel a stone in a space, then hurry immediately with an incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must clean the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger, if he is a grown man; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands firm under your finger: and gradually turn him towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it towards the exterior against the place where you wish to make an incision; and command one assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand above: and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles from the place in which is the incision.
Then insert a cutting spatula, whose form is this. And find it between the anus and testicles, not in the middle but to the left of the natis; and let the incision be upon the stone itself, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the external part of the incision may be wide, and the internal part narrow, according to the size which permits the egression of the stone from it not greater.  />
For perhaps the finger that is in the anus presses upon the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know that from the Stone is which has angles and edges, why its exit is difficult because of it.
And it is smooth, like a hazelnut, and round; and its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, to the one which has angles and edges, add into the cleft.
If it does not exit thus, then you must contrive a device on top of it; or tie a silk thread neatly around it, whose end is like the moon, which ties above the stone and does not escape from it; or that you insert underneath a fine instrument with a curved tip.
But if you cannot do so on top of it, then slightly enlarge the opening. If something overcomes you from the blood, cut it with a thread.
But if there is more than one stone, then first drive the largest to the mouth of the bladder. Then cut into it. After that, drive the smaller one after it; and do likewise if there are more than two.
If it is very large, it is a mistake to cut into it with a large incision. Because two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or a continuous dribble of urine happens; therefore, because the place does not heal at all.
Truly administer its expulsion until it exits; or contrive devices in its fragmentation with forceps until you draw it out piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense and aloe and dragon's blood; and bind it up, and place on top of it a cloth soaked in oil and wine or rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may subside.
Then make the patient lie on their back with their head elevated, and do not remove the bandage until the third day. When you have loosened it, drench the place with water and much oil.
Then treat him with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until he is cured.
However, if an inflamed abscess with burn-like symptoms occurs, such as when blood coagulates in the bladder and blocks the flow of urine, it is recognized by the presence of blood in the urine. Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood. For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply all suitable treatments for its healing until it is cured.
And during the entire course of treatment, it is necessary to bind together both thighs and buttocks so that the medicines placed on the area remain in place.
If the stone is small and lodged in the meat of the penis and blocks the flow of urine, then treat him with that which I have mentioned before you reach the point of incision. For often you will be spared from incision by this treatment, for I have already tested it.
And it is necessary to take a perforator made of steel, the shape of which is as follows: triangular tip, sharp, and fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie it to the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the penis with ease until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and gradually turn the perforator by hand in the stone, attempting to pierce it through until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For immediately the urine is released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the rod. For it is broken and exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
If this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone on the rod itself between the two ties. Then extract it. After that, loosen the tie and cleanse the clotted blood that forms at the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the thread below the stone except so that it does not return to the bladder; and another tie above except that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound. And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the thread above, to lift the skin upward so that it may return at your completion and cover the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61
¶ On the Extraction of a Woman's Stone.
A stone is rarely formed in women.
But if it happens to one of them that a stone is formed, then the treatment is difficult and is hindered by many ways.
One of these ways is that the woman may be a virgin. ›
And the second way is that you will not find a woman who exposes herself to a physician when she is chaste or has a husband.
The third way is that you will not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth way is the distance from the stone, for which a deep cut is needed, and there is fear involved in that.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then it is necessary for you to take a woman physician who knows well; and one who can be found is rarely. ›
If indeed you lack these things, then seek a chaste and skillful physician, as well as a present midwife who is well-learned in the matters of women, or a woman who has been instructed in this art: make her present, and especially command her to do everything that you instruct her based on your examination regarding the stone.
Firstly, it is necessary to look at whether the woman is a virgin. Then, she should insert her finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she should press it under her finger and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the sick woman’s vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand over the bladder and pressing it with a good pressure.
Therefore, if she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the bladder’s opening downward with all her strength until it reaches the hip joint.
Then make an incision over it at the midpoint of the vagina near the hip joint on whatever side she prepares for it and feels the stone there; let her finger not be removed from the stone as she presses under it, and let the initial cut be small.  /> Then she should insert a reed over that incision.
Then she should insert a reed over that incision. If she feels the stone, then she should increase the size of the incision according to what is proportionate so that the stone can come out from it.
And know that there are many types of stones. From these, some are small and others large; soft or hard; long or round with branches.
Therefore, know its type so that you may be informed about it for what you wish.
Therefore, if blood overcomes you, then add ground hematite to the place and hold it for one hour until the bleeding stops.  />  • Si ergo uincunt te ossa, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.  •
Then return to your operation until the stone comes out. And make sure you have with you from the instruments that I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may assist yourself in your operation.
If you are overcome by a flow of blood and know that the bleeding is from the cut artery, then place powder on the site and bind it tightly with decent ligatures, and do not remove them. Leave the stone and do not extract it. Perhaps the weak woman will die. Then care for the wound.
After the sharpness of the blood has subsided after several days and the place has become foul, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
¶ On incision for a hernia containing fluid.
A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white sac that lies under the skin and contains the testicle, which is called the scrotum.
And sometimes it occurs in the proper pouch that nature has prepared for it within the testicle, which is another sac and lies between the white scrotum that we mentioned and the skin of the testicle; this happens only rarely.  If you wish to operate on a watery hernia, do not cut near the skin or the place where the two sacs meet, but rather in the center of the lower part of the scrotum, cutting it completely through.
The cause of this hernia is indeed the weakness that affects the testicles, which is why this material flows into them. And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For its color is either inclined towards yellowish, or it is a reddish blood-color, or dark and feculent, or watery white; the last of these is the most common.  The operation for this kind of hernia is the same as that which we have described for the removal of stones in men.
And the signs by which one knows where the collection of water is located are these: "For if it is in the white scrotum that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round in length, a little like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on all sides.
"And if there is moisture in its own covering, then the abscess is round like part of an egg, and because of this, a person might think it is another egg.
"And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls under sensation.
"When you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the previously mentioned square instrument. "According to what emerges as a trace of that which was inserted, judge that which is between them.
"Therefore, when we come to the cure with iron, it is necessary for you to instruct the patient that they should be bled if possible, and see his body full.
"Then let him lie on his back over something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
"Then sit on his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right side, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the pubic region of the abdomen.
"Then take a broad spoon and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise in the middle, almost to the pubic hair; and let the incision be straight along the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white scrotum containing it; and remove it and observe, or be careful not to cut it: and let your excision by which you remove it, be from the side where it hangs more with the egg. And examine it carefully with the excision according to what is possible for you.
Then perforate the sponge full of water with a wide perforation, and remove all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the section with hooks, and extend the sponge to above, and do not touch the skin enclosing the testicles: and cut the sponge however it is possible for you to cut it, either all at once or in pieces, especially its thin side. For if you do not carefully examine, there will be no certainty that the water does not return upon cutting it.
But if the egg comes out of its shell during your operation: then, after you have filled the sponge section, put it back. Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Then care for it as you would for other wounds, until it heals.
But if you find the egg rotten because of another blackness, then it is necessary for you to tie the vessels that are the suspension, fearing a flow of blood.  />
Then cut off the testicle with its suspension and remove the egg; afterwards care for it as we have said.
But if the water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; cut off the other part just as you did to the first one equally.
And if it seems good to you that the operation is one, then do so; afterwards clean off the blood. And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil or in rose-colored oil; and place on top another piece of wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the navel: and put on top double cloths, which are pads; and tie them on top with a ligature, which has six [parts] according to this shape.
Then let two cloths be taken and soaked, and filled with wool, according to this likeness; and their ends which are pressed from a bag or wet wool; and they are gathered together with a bandage in the loins of the thighs: and one end reaches over the buttocks up to the back, and the second reaches to the pubic region; and the two other ends go over the two hips below, and the other two ends over the two groins; and all is gathered together with a bandage in the loins of the thighs.  />
And sometimes this root is treated artificially with a cautery in place of cutting with iron: and it is done by taking a subtle knife-like cautery, and cutting the skin of the testicles with it; and it is ignited, as we have narrated; until when the white sac containing water is exposed, then take a cautery of this form.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce that sac with it, and ignite it, until all moisture has exited.
Then extend the sac with hooks, and scrape it with a thin ignited cautery, and cut it as much as you can until you have removed all of it.
And be careful from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with cutting.
But if in the hour of cutting or the hour of cautery a hot abscess arises, or bleeding, or anything else: then it is necessary to cure what opposes you with the appropriate treatment for that, as has been said before.
But if the patient is fearful and does not tolerate this operation because of its horror, then perform a puncture as I have described it. And it is.
When it is confirmed to you by the signs we have mentioned that the root is watery: then you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the abscess at its lower part with a wide spatula: and make the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all water has run out.  \\
Then place a cloth over the wound and bind it; let the remaining water flow out. Then care for the patient until the wound heals.
If, however, there is resistance to the passage of water at the time you perforate it, and this is only because the white membrane causes obstruction in the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of water, then you should insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydrocephalic patients is extracted, whose form has been mentioned before; or add something to the operation of the wound for a short while.
And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts. When it accumulates again, then it should be pierced in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days.
Chapter 63.
¶ On the treatment of fleshy warts.
Know that in the incision of this wart, there is a danger leading to destruction in many situations. Therefore, it seems to me that its removal can be saved from this.
And I am reminded of the operation on it and the appearance of the wart.
Therefore, I say that many warts appear on the body, from which testicles are formed: and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Or from an acute or sharp excess that is poured out to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the wart is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found for it; and the wart is heavy.  />
And perhaps it is a stone-like wart, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation of it.
And sometimes it happens from the swelling of the arteries and their distension, as has already been mentioned before; or from the distension of veins.
Therefore, what is caused by this from the distension of the arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the wart when you press it with your fingers. And it is not necessary that you touch it at all.
But what results from the inflation of veins, nothing disperses from it upon pressing with the fingers.
And now it is possible that a section be made over this kind and over other flesh: which is to say, cutting the skin of the testicles. Then stretch the egg upwards and extract it with a white siphon: free the suspending ligaments from the vessels and tie off the vessels; cut the suspending ligament after you have freed it entirely from all parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is attached to those fleshy parts, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg and cut it.
And if there is an attachment between anything of the siphon or within it among the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that attachment and cut it with a round incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of attachment which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut all of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
When your operation is therefore completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the other treatments until it heals.
Chapter 64.
About the treatment for hemorrhoids that occur with varicose veins.
Varicose veins are a swollen tumor wrapped in some kind of wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the infirm.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it in memory.
Truly, we must say how to perform the operation on it, just as the first did.  ?>
Therefore I say that you must have the sick person sit on a raised seat. Then push the scrotum downwards. Then take hold of the skin of the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels that are near the penis; and let another assistant hold this, and stretch it out strongly.
Then cut with a sharp, broad scalpel across the vessels until they are laid bare.
Then peel it from all sides, as we have told you in the removal of temporal arteries.
Then place an awl with a double thread in it, and tie the thread at the first places where the vessels are found; and tie it again at the last of these places. Then cut them with a straight cut lengthwise through the body, and remove whatever has accumulated from fetid, corrupt moisture.
Then treat the wound like other wounds, where there is power to generate pus, so that the vessels which nourish the one testicle may fall away. For it is not bad through this.
But if the vessel should happen to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed along with the vessels; so that the egg may not be deprived of its nourishment through the incision and rot or dry up and be no use.
Chapter 65.
¶ On treating a hernia of the small intestine.
The result of this hernia is the scrotum's splitting, which happens when the intestine becomes extended over the stomach in the groin area from the navel. ‌
Why do the intestines descend through that rupture to one of the testicles? ‌ ‌ And this rupture is either from the scrotum or its stretching.
And these two types happen for many reasons: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things. ‌
And a sign is when it is from stretching. It is what happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an abscess equal in depth: because the swelling compresses the intestine.
And a sign of it is when it is from the cutting of the swelling, because it causes severe pain suddenly at its beginning; and it is an abscess appearing under the skin nearby: and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and its path towards the exterior part of the swelling.
And sometimes it exits with the intestine and a faecal mass; and this is called "intestinal fistula" or "faecal fistula"; and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces flow into the intestine and are retained there; and it brings death to the sick person; because it causes severe pain, especially when pressed upon.
And in the treatment of this disease with iron, there is danger; therefore it is necessary to be cautious in its use.
And the method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine by hand into the depths of their own cavity, if it submits to being returned. Then he should be placed on his back with his head between your hands; and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut all of the scrotal skin along its length. Then place hooks in the two lips of the incision according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be such that it is possible for an egg to pass through it.
Then scrape the swelling and what is beneath the scrotal skin until the white swelling is exposed, hard on all sides; then insert your index finger between the testicle and the white swelling that is beneath the scrotum and between the second swelling, and separate it from its attachment in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with the right hand to the interior skin of the testicles, and with this extend the white thread upwards with the left hand; lift the egg with the thread towards the section; instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards; and you release the adhesion that is behind after the solution is completed.
And check with your fingers to ensure there is nothing of the entrails wrapped in the hard white thread. But if you find anything from it, then push it down towards the abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made from ten threads; and insert it through the end of the thread, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles following the section; then cut off the ends protruding from the thread until there are four threads left. Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross; and tie with them the thread which we have mentioned, because it is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature, so that nothing from the vessels that nourish them can reach them: so that a hot abscess does not arise from there. And place another ligature outside the first ligature, distant by two finger widths. And after these two ligatures leave from the thread that is under the skin of the testicles a length equal to the size of a finger; and cut off the rest completely according to its roundness, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles at the place from which blood and pus flow, as we have narrated in what has been described before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white thread which we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood. It often happens. And let the suture drop on its own.
If, however, its fall is delayed, then it should be soaked in warm water and place on it what we have said until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the wound treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 66
¶ On a swollen nose.
In this condition, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
And indeed the first said that it occurs as we have narrated in a swelling of the nose which is with a vein. That is, after tying the vessels tightly after cutting them, treat them below with ease; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it until the vessels fall out with what opens it up; and treat the wound as we have said until it heals. ︎
Chapter 67
¶ On a rupture that occurs in the groin.
When a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the area protrudes, but nothing comes out of the intestines to the testicles; and if something does come out, it is not much and returns every hour. But if that time is prolonged, a fissure is added in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum. ︎ ︎
And this occurs from the extension of the scrotum which is in the groin, as we have said. ︎ ︎ ︎ That is, because the scrotum stretches; then it softens and the area swells up.
And its treatment is with a caustic, as the preceding narrative has shown.
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner; and that is to have the patient lie on his back between your hands. ︎ ︎ ︎ Then cut the area of the swollen and protruding rupture with a transverse incision, the width of three fingers.
Then tie off the al-saifaq and the parts under the skin until the white al-saifaq, which follows it, is exposed.
Then take a reed and place it on the protruding part of the intestine, and press it down into the abdomen.
Then if there are two protruding parts on the end of the reed coming out of the intestine, join one to the other with a stitch; then pull out the end of the reed.
And do not cut through the al-saifaq at all, nor push an egg or anything else into it, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal adhesions.
Then treat it with wound care. So when you cut the strings, cleanse it and close the wound until it heals.
For the intestine contracts, and no protrusion of rupture occurs.
And cautery is better in this place because it is closer to healing.
Chapter 68.
¶ About softening the skin of the testicles.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the meat between them is also softened and its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it that he make the sick man lie on his back and cut off all of the softened skin above the natural skin.  />
Then gather the two lips together with a stitch; and if you wish, first remove the excess softened skin with three or four stitches, and secure the stitch firmly.
Then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the care of other wounds until it heals and the strings fall out.  />
Chapter 69.  />  />
¶ About castration.
You should know that castration is excommunicated according to our law: and because of this it would be permitted for me not to mention it in my book; and there is no need to mention it except for two reasons.
One of these is so that it may be known by the physician when he is asked about it, and so that he may know how to treat the one on whom it has occurred.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefit through it, such as rams, asses, cats, and similar creatures.
I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways. Either by attrition. Or by incision and cutting.
In that which is done by attrition, the way of the operation is this: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become softened and relaxed and hang down; then you grind them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear to touch.
But in the castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary for you to hold the animal and press its testicular skin with your left hand.
Then bind the suspensory ligament, and cut above both testicles with a single incision until two testicles protrude; then cut them after you have removed the skin from each, and do not leave anything on them except for a thin layer of tissue that is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, and so the animal desires copulation.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70
¶ On the treatment of a hermaphrodite in two ways. ¶
A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways. "One of them is that it appears as a gap or in the skin of the testicles, between two testicles, in the form of a woman's mouth with hair on it; and sometimes urine flows from it.
"However, in women there is one form, and it is like a woman's mouth above the pubis, similar to a man's small testicles protruding outward; of which one is like a man's penis and two like two testicles.
"And the treatment for these three forms, two from men and one from women, is that you should cut away the added flesh until the impression of them disappears. "Then treat them with the same care as other wounds.
"In the second form of men, from which urine flows and is located in the skin of the testicles, there is no treatment or cure whatsoever.
"Chapter 71.
"About cutting the labia minora and protruding flesh in women's genitals.
"The labia minora may grow excessively over the natural state until it becomes unsightly and disfigured; sometimes it increases so much in certain women that it swells like in men and reaches the point of intercourse.
"Therefore, you should hold the excess of the labia minora with your hand or with a hook and cut it; do not finish cutting deeply, especially at the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
"Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
"The flesh that grows is the flesh that develops at the opening of the womb until it fills it, and sometimes it protrudes outside like a tail; and because of this some call this disease 'tail-like'. "Therefore, we should cut it as we would the labia minora and treat it until it heals.
The care of Alratica, which is a woman's ulcer that has not perforated.
Chapter 72.
Alratica is, as it were, a woman's ulcer that has not perforated, or there may be a small hole. And it is either natural or acquired.
Acquired is from the preceding illness, and it itself occurs either from flesh born of an addition or sifach subtilis or thick: and it occurs either in the depths of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and pregnancy, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And the recognition of it is by the inspection of the midwife, if there is an apparent protrusion nearby.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with a stick.
If the protrusion is from sifach subtilis and is near the two lips, then hasten and cut it off.
And it is, as if you place on the two lips a small amount of powder.
Then place your indicators of both hands together and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread. 》 》 Then stretch the two lips firmly until the sifach subtilis is broken open and the protrusion is exposed.
Then take some wool and soak it in oil and place it on the spot; and let the woman keep doing this every day, so that the place does not become hardened in another way.
But if the sifach is thick and dense, then it is necessary to cut it off with a broad scalpel similar to a myrtle leaf. 》 》 》 》
If the protrusion is from flesh born of an addition, then hang it with hooks and cut it off; and let there be with you medicines that settle bleeding without irritation, such as acacia and dragon's blood and powdered eggshell.
Then administer a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; hold it for some days. And administer dry linen bandage, then proceed with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Sometimes a mass of other flesh forms in the womb; it is necessary to cut it according to this method: as long as it is not a malignant tumor, for a malignant tumor in the womb cannot be treated with iron at all.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athena, and red pustules in women's wounds.
Hemorrhoids are the opening of the vein passages until much blood runs out of them constantly.
When hemorrhoids become inflamed, they become pustules; and I have already mentioned their divisions, characteristics, and signs in the previous section. Here, I will explain which ones can be treated and which cannot. )))
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids located at the opening of the womb and not felt by touch cannot be treated with iron.
But those that are located at the opening of the womb and can be felt by touch can be treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house. Then stretch Athena with scissors or with rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle powder on them at the time of bleeding from one of the cut-off powders without moldiness, such as acacia, dragon's blood, thyme, and similar ones. ))) ))) ))))
Then let her press her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water. ))) ))) )))) )))
But if the bleeding persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds, gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on his back.
If the blood is cut with it, that is good; and if not, make adhesive plasters stick to his back and nipples without puncturing.
Then take wool and soak it in the juice of taractyllum, or the juice of arnoglosse, or the juice of the branches of alaual, that is, aglanthus, with Pontic wine, and make it stick to the place.
When the abscess rests, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
However, the red albarth resembles the heads of garlic and is rough to look at.
Therefore you should cut what appears from it, as I said about the thelili, and care for it until it heals.
Chapter 74.
§ On Perforations of the Birth Canal that Occur in the Uterus.
Many types of abscesses occur in the uterus, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thelili, and hot abscess.  />
And I have already spoken about all these illnesses and their types, and the signs of them, and their treatments in the division; it is necessary for me to speak about hot abscess that occurs in the uterus, when it is one of the abscesses that collect pus, and you want to know how its opening with iron is made.  /> 
You should therefore consider: If the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with pulsation and heat and fever, and you see it redden; if a sense of loss occurs over it, then do not hasten to perforate it: care for it until it reaches maturation, until the acuteness of the incident subsides.  />  
Then you should have the woman sit on a seat with two openings, and let her lean back or be placed on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and let her hips be spread apart, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a suitable ligament.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is opened.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, it is necessary that you measure with a rod the depth of the womb of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and it harms the patient.
But if the instrument is more than the depth of the womb, then it is necessary that you place cotton over the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that you place the handle, which runs in the instrument, on the upper side: and let the assistant hold the instrument and let him roll the handle until the depth of the womb is opened.
Therefore, when the opening appears and is touched by hand and is soft and gentle: then it is necessary that you cut it off at its head with a wide spatula.
Therefore, when the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent quality into the wound: and place the cloth, and pull out the cut from the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb and over the pubic bone clean wool soaked in water in which mallow has been boiled.
Then after two days it should be cleaned with a suitable ointment until it heals.
And sometimes the abdomen and wound are washed such that they are given an enema with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound has been hidden inside the abdomen, then you must be prevented from treating it with iron; instead, treat it with what we have said in the division.
Chapter 70.
¶ Instructions for Midwives, on how to heal living embryos that have exited in a non-natural form.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the natural form of childbirth.
From its signs, you will know that when you see a woman pressed down to her lower parts and she desires to smell the air, and what is above her concerning childbirth is relieved, and the embryo hastily exits; then know that this birth is in the natural form, and its exit is over its head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended or hanging from the navel.
When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press on her abdomen so that the embryo may descend quickly.
For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleaned of those excesses by a good cleaning.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural, inpraiseworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits over its feet, and its body comes out before its head and its feet and one hand or one of its feet; or it exits headfirst with its hands; or its intestines come out; and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar forms from the inpraiseworthy ones. />
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to guard herself from error and deception; and I will show every form of them, and what the nature is in each one, and how it can be recognized and dealt with.
When the fetus comes out headfirst by its natural exit and becomes strong against the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and steam her face with fenugreek decoction and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers and explore with it the secondine, and cut it with her nail until what is in it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then command her, after the enema, to be pressed; and make her sneeze with cumin, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. For immediately the fetus will come out.
If two hands of the fetus emerge first, then you should carefully return them gradually with ease. But if it does not obey upon entry, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet up; then shake the seat on the ground, and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them off, and extract the remainder of the fetus; and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it gently, for it will come out.
The exit of the embryo over its feet. When the fetus emerges over its feet, then it is necessary to push them up; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards equalize it.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Therefore, when they come out to the hips, then command her to be pressed, and make her sneeze with cumin; for it will emerge if God wills it. 
And if it does not come out with what we have described, then gradually bring back the fetus until you place it in its natural shape. For he will then come out easily.
And if it is hindered with all that we have described, then take from the mucilage of flaxseed, and oil of sesame, and dissolved gum; and strike all together in a mortar with good pounding. Then anoint the woman's vulva and lower belly with it. Then make her sit in warm water until she reaches orgasm.
And when you see that the lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh and insert it. When the pessary has been in place for one hour, then have her sit on the stool. Then make her sneeze, and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen. For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is through the knees and hands. When it exits in this way, then she should insert her hands gradually.  /> Then let the woman be turned onto her back with her feet hanging down, and she should lie on a bed, wrapping her hands around herself. Then gradually press above her abdomen.  />  /> Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows until she is ready below.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  /> If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them vigorously. Then gradually press above the pubis until the fetus rises upwards. Then she should insert her hands and gradually bring the fetus down; and instruct the woman to bear down until the fetus comes out.  />
The exit of a laterally hanging fetus from the hands. His hand is to be restored to its position. But if it cannot be reduced, then raise the woman and make her walk.
If she is unable to walk, then lay her on a bed; and shake her legs with great force.
Then apply the ointment which you have prepared from adhesives.
But if she receives it in labor, then make her sit on a seat. Then strive to restore the hand and make the fetus equal according to its natural shape; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus on its back with its hands extended, and its face is towards its mother's back. The midwife should hold the fetus' hand, then gradually roll it and equalize it with ease.
When it is equalized, then place on its nostrils what we have mentioned made from oil and adhesives.
Then command her to move slowly. When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat and command her to lean towards the right side. Then command her to compress herself; and make her sneeze with the help of the midwife.
The exit of a prepared fetus on its side.                     When it descends to the mouth of the womb in this way with the caul, then cut the caul with your nail until it is evacuated by its moisture.
If it hangs over the face and neck of the fetus, then cut her from the navel; so that it is not retained, and dies.                    
Then push the fetus into the womb until you place her as needed: and instruct the woman to compress herself several times; for he will come out through the easy exit.
Exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three, and four are born. Nevertheless, this is strange and rarely happens.
Five, however, is a thing beyond nature, and they do not live at all; and the secondine contains them, although they are many, with one. And they are separated by the sifach, distinguishing between each of them the ligament in their respective navels.
And sometimes they come out as if a single fetus comes out through the natural and easy exit; and they come out through a praiseworthy exit, as we have told.
But if some of them are difficult at birth and come to the unnatural figures we have mentioned, then care for them as we have said; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and delay, and arrange according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by the ingenuity leading to health. 》
Remembering what forms in the womb from embryos and miscarries.
Sometimes one forms in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified with me that a woman miscarrying expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed. 》 》 ⟩
This was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the obstetrician. For perhaps it will come to her as that was; therefore let her oppose with what is needed
Chapter 76
About the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you cure a dead fetus with the medicine I mentioned in the division, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use surgery, then you must consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution and not affected by any condition that poses a risk to her life: then it is necessary for the woman to be turned onto her back on the bed, on her back, and let her head be lowered, and her legs raised: and let an assistant hold her from both sides, or she may be tied to the bed, so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils mixed with mallow mucilage, and fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should gently insert it into the womb. Then she should seek with it the place where she may insert the hooks into the fetus and the appropriate places for that.
Therefore consider, if the fetus is prepared to descend head first: then insert the hooks into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or its breastbone, or in places near the ribs and under the armpits.
But if the descent is foot first, then in its pubic bone and midribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand and place its curvature between the fingers of her left hand and insert it gently with her hand until she fixes the hook in one of those places we mentioned, until it reaches an empty space.
Then she should fix another hook or a third one if necessary on the opposite side, so that there is an equal tension and it does not deviate to one side.
Then let it be stretched equally and not only straight but also moved in every direction to ease its removal, as is done with a tooth during extraction.
And it should be so that what is between them softens the extension. If a part is retained from it, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them into that part to rotate and remove what is retained.
If a part of the fetus comes out, then move the hooks to another place that is higher; do this until the entire fetus comes out.
If a hand comes out before the others and it is not possible to return it because of its swelling; then a cloth should be wrapped around it. Then pull it out until the entire hand comes out; cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow; and thus you should do for the other hand and both feet.
If however the fetus' head is large or becomes swollen at birth, or if there is water gathered on its head; then a thorny spatula should be inserted between the fingers and used to pierce the head and remove the water; or it should be ruptured with an instrument called Almisdac. The shape of which will come with the shapes of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, if the fetus is by nature of large head, then one should cut with a trepan and extract it with the instrument called misdach, as we have said. Then draw out the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and becomes swollen at the collarbone; then pierce it until the fluid from the chest is released.
But if it does not become complicated nor submit to birth; then cut the head piece by piece as is possible for you.
If the swelling is in the lower abdomen and it is accompanied by dropsy, you should pierce it until the moisture runs out.
If however the fetus is on its feet, then its delivery is easy and its direction toward the mouth of the womb is gentle.
But if it is constricted in the abdomen or chest, then you should extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and open the abdomen or chest until what is inside flows out.
But if the other limbs have been delivered and only the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand. Therefore, if the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand deep into the womb and search for the head with it, and draw it to the mouth of the womb with her fingers; then let her insert into it one hook or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot swelling that has befallen her, then it is not fitting to labor over it; rather, it is fitting at that time to apply emollients and fatty substances, and administer poultices, and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, it may turn; then let what we said be administered for a living fetus be given.
If that is not possible, then cut it piece by piece and extract it.
And you must not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Therefore, when you have completed your work, then administer what we said for hot swellings that occur in the womb.
But if there is a flow of blood, then let her sit in styptic waters and administer the rest of the treatment.
And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant with another, and afterward that fetus also died. And so after a long time an abscess occurred on her navel, and it swelled until it burst; and she began to discharge pus.
Therefore I was called for her treatment, and I treated her for a long time; yet the wound did not heal.
And so I placed on it certain strong drawing plasters; and a mouth came out of that place. Then after several days another mouth emerged from there. Therefore I was amazed by this, since there is no mouth in the womb.
And so I thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.  \\
And so I examined the wound and extracted many bones while the woman was in good health; and now she has lived in this way for a long time, and she emits little pus from that place.
And I would not have noted this strange occurrence here unless there is knowledge and help in it for what a skilled doctor does with his hand in treatment.
Chapter LXXVII.
¶ On the Forms of Necessary Instruments for Fetal Extraction.
The shape of the loop by which the womb is opened.
Here is the form of the instrument called the stricture, which is used to equalize the lips; it has two rollers equally placed at the ends of two wooden pieces. However, this roller must be finer than the stricture; and it is made either from ebony or boxwood.  />   \\
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the edge of each is about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two attachments made from the same type of wood, which have already been firmly attached to both, whose length is more than a half-palm; and the width of each is about two fingers, or slightly more.
And these two instruments are inserted into the womb's mouth so that it may be opened when you turn two loops.
Another form similar to that one, but finer and lighter.
It is made of ebony or boxwood, according to the shape of forceps. However, at its end there should be two instruments, as you see here above: and the length of each instrument is like a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore, when you wish to open the womb with it, make the woman sit on a bed with her feet hanging down and her legs spread apart. Then insert these two connected instruments into the womb, and you are holding the end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish for the opening of the womb's mouth until it does what the midwife wants.
The shape of another loop, which the ancients called the shape of the pusher, by which the fetus is pushed out.
The shape of Almisdagh, by which a large head is crushed, and it resembles forceps with teeth at the end, as you see. xspace
And sometimes it is made elongated, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, with teeth like a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
The shape of the one-spined hook. xspace xspace
The shape of the two-spined hook.
Form with two ends for cutting off the head.
Form of two broad spatulas.
All these instruments are used, and the more their kinds are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the swifter he is at his task, and the greater he stands among men because of his skill.
Therefore, do not disdain any of these instruments so that it may be prepared by you. Their necessity is inexcusable.
Chapter LXXVIII.
¶ On the Extraction of Secundina.
When the Secundina is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze with you: and press your hand on her mouth and nose. If it therefore comes out through this [method], that is good.
If not: then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid; and put in it opening herbs of the womb, such as calamentum, rue, dill, chamomile, saffron, cassia wood, and centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, and steep them with water and place [them] on the fire.
Then place a reed funnel on the hole of the pot lid, and its other end in the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.  For indeed the Secundina will come out easily.
But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil or in thickened althea [mallow]. Then let her insert [her hand] into the vulva and seek with it the Secundina. "When he finds it, then let him take it and slowly extend it.
"If however it is attached deep within the womb, then he should insert his hand as we have described until he finds the placenta and gradually extracts it straight away so that the womb does not collapse due to excessive force. Rather, it should be turned gently to the right and left, and then pulled according to the amount of traction needed. "For at that point, she will comply, be saved, and escape from the obstruction.
"But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described, care for her with sneezing and with a decoction made from herbs.
"But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself too much during the process of extraction.
"Truly, whatever comes out at the mouth of the womb from her, you should tie to the woman's thigh. "Then enema her with the four-ingredient ointment. "For that will cause it to putrefy after a few days and it will dissolve and come out.
"However, when it putrefies, an evil smell rises to the stomach and head, harming the sick person. "Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for that.
"Some of the ancients have already experienced the usefulness of fumigation with cress and dried figs."
"Description of the instrument used to fumigate a woman during retained placenta or menses.
"Let it be made from a glass similar to an alcama, or from wax. The wide end should be placed over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on coals. Let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed, and then repeat with another.
Chapter 79.
On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, which have already been blocked by a thin film. Therefore, the midwife should pierce that thin film with her finger; and if she cannot, she should pierce it with a sharp spatula, taking care not to touch the scrotum.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on top of it. Then care for him with ointments until he is healed.
But if you fear that it will become blocked again, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
And now an obstruction of the anus can also occur due to the healing of a wound or an abscess. 》 Therefore, that healing should be cut away, and then it should be treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
Chapter 80.
¶ On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are knots and swellings that happen near the anus outside or in the space of one fingerbreadth; and there is one fistula or more.
Therefore, when that knot is cut open, it opens and from it flows a watery white fluid or thin pus.
And sometimes there are fistulas that penetrate from these. Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out during defecation and flatulence when the sick person uses defecation; and perhaps a worm comes out of them. 》 》 》
And there are fistulas among these when they penetrate in the space as far as the bladder and as far as the opening of the penis. 》 》 》 》 》 》 And there are some that penetrate as far as the hip joint and as far as the tailbone. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
When it is recognized that the fistula reaches to the anus, whether penetrating or not, do this: insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe of iron or steel into the fistula if there is no twisting.
If there is a twisting, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or a horsehair until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
If you do not feel it completely and nothing comes out of the opening, neither wind nor worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating; hasten to treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or the opening of the urine, then its sign is the issuing of urine from it and its prevention so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
However, if it is penetrating to the joint of the thigh or the hip socket, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no twisting up to the opening; and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus always comes out of it; and that treatment in it does not avail nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity for him who wastes his time on them.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, a cure is hoped for with a saw as I narrate to you and have already proved: and it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back; and raise his legs above his hips and his hips be bent toward his belly. Then insert a probe of lead or iron if there is twisting in the fistula until you know where the probe has reached.
If however the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Therefore, if you feel on your finger the probe has passed through itself, apart from what you feel between your finger and the probe or flesh: then you should certainly know that it is penetrating. So do not struggle with it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
They have said, however, that some people are cured when the flesh is cauterized and the medication by which they hope for improvement is to ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as was previously described, and insert it burning into the fistula until it reaches the anus. Then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those added fleshy bits have been burned away, similar to a bird's feather quill.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter until the burned flesh comes out; then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth and consolidation.
If it is healed, good.
And if not, then it will never be cured by any other treatment.
And if the probe comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or probe between them, and you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin: then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and go cutting with the probe that is in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe is, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then clean away those fleshy bits that are similar to a bird's feather quill, so that nothing of them remains.
But if the bleeding overcomes you and loosens between you and your work so that you can cut those fleshy bits: then it is better what happens, and more rapid healing, to cauterize with fire or sharp medication.
Because the cautery, combined with fire, possesses beneficial properties, it adds to the burning of those tissues and the cutting off of blood, as well as the drying out of moisture.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter or pounded cabbage leaves until the place discharges pus and the burned flesh comes out with the pus.
Then treat the wound with healing ointments that produce hard flesh; and these are medications that contain astringents and drying agents.
For when they are restored, then it is healed; and do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula has already reached the depth of the rectum and extends from an excess of bodily fluid, then insert your finger into the rectum and examine with it.
Therefore, if you feel a band or membrane of silk or flesh between yourself and it, and it is close to perforation, then there is no operation on it except by the way of trust and hope.
This is because one of three methods is applied to it: either you cauterize it as we said, or you cut it out until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert linen cloths and nearby treatment. And do not proceed too much with the cutting so that you do not cut the ligament that holds the rectum and cause the unfortunate outcome of incontinence without intention. Then treat it as we have said.
For perhaps it will heal; or you may lengthen the membrane itself and cleanse it after cutting it nearly to the rectum as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then cleanse those pieces of flesh that are in the incision as far as you can with probing.
Then strive to restore the entire wound with the incision and the upper orifice where it is healed; and let the fistula remain open in the interior part of the rectum, and it will be less harmful to the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is treated in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for embroidering, that is, preparing hides, in this manner. And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and about that length. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its depth.
But if it is penetrating the edge of the anus from within near to it, then withdraw the thread from that opening; in such a way that you insert your finger into the anus and draw out the end of the thread, and bring together both ends at once; and tie each one, and leave it for one day or two days. And however much the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls away; then treat the wound until it heals and cures.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate by whatever means you prepare for yourself, unless it is very deep. For you do not have the ability to do this for the sake of the fleshy part, so that you do not cut into it.
Then treat it as we have said until it heals.
The form of a spiky spatula by which the fistula is probed, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter 81
¶ On the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood flows after their incision, and on the treatment of fissures.
There are two types of hemorrhoids. Or indeed, they are within the anus, similar to bladders of coal or plums; or as if they were themselves the seeds of grapes. And from them are small ones and large ones, and blood always flows from them, and it is one, and they are many. And they are outside the anus and at its ends.
Nevertheless, those which are outside the anus are for the most part of little moisture, from which runs yellow water or a small amount of blood with persistent flow, and they correspond in color to the body.
And its treatment which is within the anus is to advise the sick person to take a seat and to squeeze until the anus comes out and reveals the hemorrhoids to you. Therefore, hang them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail. Then cut them at their roots.
But if hooks do not hold them due to their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or a piece of coarse woolen cloth and draw them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and after the incision sprinkle on them some warm powders so that they serve as a caustic. Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization. Then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
But if the anus does not comply with coming out, then give the sick person a clyster in which there is a small amount of biting (irritant), so that it washes away what is in the anus and quickly complies with coming out when the patient squeezes.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their treatment is light and easy; and it is as if you take them with your fingernail or take them with a hook and cut them. Then care for them with what we have said until they heal.
And he who abhors the cutting with iron, then it is necessary for you to apply their stitches in this manner. Take thread wound around and push it through a needle. Then draw out the thread to the top and make it penetrate with the needle into its base from the other side; and wind the two ends of the thread beneath the point of the needle, so that they are lateral; and tighten the thread tightly. Then tie off the thread and withdraw the needle.
Do this with all the threads, but leave one out; nor draw it tight, so that excess blood may run from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cedar oil, and place it over the anus; and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave him until he passes it.
When the threads fall out, care for them with ointments and other treatment until they heal.
¶ On the Treatment of Fissures. For often they happen from the drying out of feces and constriction of nature. ›
When they become chronic and the medicine is ineffective, then it is necessary for you to scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they are moistened and the top layer which prevents them from healing is removed. Then care for them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal, then repeat the scraping with greater force than before until they bleed much; then care for them until they heal. › ‹
¶ On the Treatment of Inverted and Uninverted Hemorrhoids; Dry Threads and Carbuncles.
Chapter 82
You should know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and from this comes pain during walking.
Therefore, it must be cut around the head of the nail and held with forceps or a hook, and it should be pulled out from its root.
Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said previously in its chapter.
From athalil, however, there is one small rough, crusty, round lump above the surface of the body. And they often occur in children's hands.
And its treatment is that you stretch the athalil and cut it off: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine as previously mentioned: and thus the inverted athalils, and not the uninverted ones, are removed with an instrument that I will mention.
However, a formica is also a small rough lump on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when it encounters cold, it feels like an ant bite, and it occurs throughout the body: and it mostly happens in hands.
And its treatment is that you take a quill from a goose feather or a strong vulture feather: and place this quill over the formica, until the circle of the quill contains its parts. Then turn your hand with the quill until you cut what is around the formica: and place it deep into the flesh, and pull out the formica from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of brass or iron, in this shape.
"Let the upper end of the syringe draw the plugged catheter, so that its grasp on the finger is alleviated and its rolling back.
"And if you wish to cauterize with an ant, as was mentioned in the section on cautery in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter 83
"Concerning the shapes of instruments that are used for enemas in cases of illnesses of the anus and to relieve the intestines and colic.
"Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or copper, or cast bronze, or hammered.
"And sometimes these instruments are made small and large according to those into whom they are administered.
"Therefore, that which is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and likewise their enemas if their anus is weak or painful.
"A large enema.
"The tube of it, that is, the upper end where the bag is tied, should be wide according to this manner; and there should be a distinct part so that the bag can be tied as you see, and its lower end which enters into the anus should be plugged, that is, not open, very gentle, drawing to fineness; and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
"And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the reeds, somewhat thicker; and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be from a bladder of an animal or from sheepskin, which should be according to the shape of a small syringe, whose tube is one palm long.
"And it should be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger. "Then insert through those holes a thread made of raw silk, which should consist of ten threads or thereabouts, and attach the bag to it like an ear syringe. When therefore it is placed within, let the enema be tied at the head between two tightenings with a strong constriction. Then let him be given an enema with it.
And this is the form of the circle of the bag here depicted, and its openings.
The quality of administering the enema with it is this: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the patient; and be careful that it is not very hot nor very cold.
Then let the patient be turned onto their back and lift up their legs; and place under him an intahaan, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a cloth.
Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances. Then insert it into the anus gently. Then let the attendant take the bag with both his hands together and squeeze it forcefully until he has expelled all that is within the enema into the intestine.
Then remove the enema, and let the patient raise their legs against the wall.
And if the medicine forces him to go out, then let him hold it as long as he is able. And if he sleeps with it throughout the night, it is more efficacious in its assistance.
But if you give him an enema for abdominal pains and his evacuation is urgent; then repeat the enema until he is cured.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very fine and mild, like those with which children are given enemas.
And this is the form of a fine enema on which the skin should be tightly drawn.
Chapter 84
And I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was suitable for the book, and here I will say the treatment of them with the hand and with medicines according to their nature.
Therefore, I say that wounds are distinguished according to that by which the wound is made and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are made are often like these: a blow with a stone; or a cut with a sword or knife; or a strike with a spear, stick, or arrow; and similar things from many objects.
Moreover, wounds according to the parts of the body are as follows: a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar things from those members.
And I am narrating the treatments of some wounds so that I may place this reasoning and rule over other wounds. 》
And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the treatment of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say. When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of bone, consider if it is from the blow of a stone or similar things and has only torn the skin, and the wound is large, and you fear an unfavorable outcome of a hot aposteme; then hasten and make an immediate cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay that; and draw out from the blood according to its quantity. If there is nothing preventing the phlebotomy, especially if the amount of blood coming out of the wound is small. And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the patient take care to avoid fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
If something prevents the cutting off, then let it be cut off from food, and not approach meats or wines.
And place on the wound if it develops a hot abscess, cooked onion infused only in rose oil or with wine that has an astringent property.
But if you are safe from the hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments until it heals.
But if the wound is large or from a sword cut and similar: and its edges do not come together with stitches, then gather them with stitching, as I will describe in the chapter on wounds of the belly about their stitching.
But if the wound has already been detached from the bone and hangs down and there is no retention of it except in a small ligament: then cut it off. Then care for the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to be nourished with foods that are thick like porridge and boiled wheat until it is like a paste and similar foods.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all of the putrefied part and throw it away; then care for it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it does not clot with medicines, then seek for the artery. Therefore if you find it uncut, then cut it with a scalpel or ligature it. But if necessity demands when the aforementioned method does not work, then cauterize it until the blood clots.
If these wounds are small and simple, then their condition is easy and light; sprinkle this powder over them, for it will heal them before the air changes them.
Method of the flesh-forming powder: Take one part of frankincense and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of fresh lime. Grind them all together very finely and sift them; then fill the wound with it and bind it tightly until it adheres well and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with small pieces of cloth, and leave it undisturbed until it is completely healed, so that it does not become detached. For the medicine will not be removed from it until it has healed.
And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood at hand; for dragon's blood also performs the same function in many large wounds, when it is placed upon them and they are bound, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood, which the air has not yet changed.
But if the air has already changed them somewhat, especially in summertime, then this powder is not useful for their treatment; therefore care for them with what we have said, placing upon them certain digestive ointments, or place upon them poultices made from barley meal, mixed with water and honey, until they put forth pus. Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
But if a bone is broken along with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with pincers; and now I will speak of the treatment for head fractures as follows.
On wounds of the neck:
But if a wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in its treatment from that of a simple head wound.
If however the nerve of the neck or artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy for it, except to avoid its treatment with what causes intense coagulation, such as ziniar and zegi, and similar things. Since they harm nerves and constrict them.
And you shall not place anything cold at all on the wound; because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the highest part of the body: and let that which is used for treatment be mild, such as lime washed many times with sweet water mixed with oil, or with rose oil and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water; and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
However, if the wound is large, then apply stitches; or close its lips with small pieces of cloth. Then care for him until he heals.
However, if the wound is deep or an abscess has formed at its lower part where pus is already gathering, then pierce it in a deeper place therein.
If an artery has been cut in the wound and its bleeding has followed, then separate it or cut it off and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
However, if the thyroid cartilage has been cut entirely or in part and the alhaudaj have been saved, then gather the lips of the skin with stitches above the cricoid cartilage, and do not touch the throat; rather make it equal and return it to its natural shape. Then bind it with a proper tightness and leave it for several days. Then care for him with ointments that have coagulant and drying properties until he heals.
If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: if there are bone fragments in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can; and what is not ready, leave it until the wound becomes putrid, and its opening separates and softens.
If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that I mentioned. If bone appears in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it as mentioned in its chapter.
¶ On wounds of the lips.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife: and you see its depth, then observe. If, therefore, there is windiness coming out of the wound when the patient pants, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if the wound is not deep and it is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient; but put on it a drawing ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
But if you do not have the ointment present, then put an old cloth on the mouth of the wound to absorb what comes out of it from moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what accumulates in it runs off.
But if three days or more have already passed for the wound, and no spasm, nor bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing has befallen the patient, and you see that its other dispositions are good: then know that the wound is safe. Therefore, treat him with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
If healing is hindered and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has formed. Treat it according to its own chapter.
And if the wound is from the cut of a sword or knife and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what was mentioned before for stitching, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an imprint on the bone and fragments have broken off from it, then search for the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate. But if they are not separate, then leave them until the wound becomes foul, for their extraction will be easier.
But the treatment of other wounds occurring in other parts follows the same judgment as we said.
¶ On Wounds of the Belly and Exit of Intestines and Their Healing
A wound that occurs in the belly is great, medium, or small.
Therefore, from a great wound sometimes an intestine or several intestines protrude.
Because of this, their introduction and their stitching are more forceful and difficult.
And a small wound also becomes difficult in another way. Therefore, if you do not hasten to return them immediately to their place, the swelling will occur, it will open up and become thick, which makes their entry difficult.
Therefore, a medium wound is better for wounds, because with it the return of the intestine is not difficult, as it happens with these two kinds.
Know that the stitching of the belly is in four ways.
Two stitches are common to the stitching of the belly and to the stitching of other wounds of the body, while two other stitches are peculiar to other wounds.  /> > The common ones are: the first one is a simple one, and the second one is with a needle. Truly they are more specific for the closure of the abdomen: and I narrate each to you with explanation and elucidation.
I say therefore, that when the wound is small and some of the intestine has protruded from it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is because of one of two things. Either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Therefore, when this is the case, you should heat it so that you dip a sponge or wet cloth in warm water alone. Or boil in water safflower, cumin, and nutmeg, and smear the intestine with it until the swelling is resolved.
Sometimes he does this with wine that has astringency, and it is better than plain water for resolving swelling.
Therefore, when you see the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mallow has been boiled. For through this its entry will be facilitated with something small. ›
But if its return is hindered after this treatment, then find the small wound with an instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
And the first cure is better when it is prepared than when it is cut: and there is no need to cut after necessity and lack of an instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted and pointed, and the other part not pointed, and let its tip not be very fine like a spatula, but rather somewhat blunter; and it is similar to a hook, as you see. › ›
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine comes out, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural shape in its proper place, if possible, for this is better. › ›
When however there is a large disruption in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And likewise if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and your care always to this, that the part in which the wound is may be higher than the other part.
And thus you should do this for large wounds and medium wounds.
But for small wounds, place it as it is prepared for you.
Then make sure that there is a pious assistant at hand who holds the entire disruption with his hand: and gather its lips together.  Then let him who follows take the stitching one thing after another, and this is the common method of single stitching.
And it is that you should take a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound. Then leave from the end of the disruption a thumb's width, that is, the doctor's; and insert one needle through what you put in it a thread at both ends of the skin, with both ends of the sinew that is under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate on the other side, and you have already gathered together two ends of the skin and two ends of the sinew: and there are four rows.
Then pull with the double thread around the needle several times from both sides together, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together with a decent union.
Then leave another thumb's width, and insert another needle; afterwards draw it with the thread, as you did with the first needle. You should not hesitate to perform it with what you need from the cubits until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
And let the needles be of medium size between thickness and thinness: for thin needles cut the flesh very quickly; and thick ones are difficult to enter into the skin; therefore, they ought to be of medium size in both thinness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate that the needle be inserted in the two extremities of the skin very close together so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound opens before its own healing, and also so that they do not elongate with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient in his sleep; and put small woolen cloths around them from all sides, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the wound has already healed.
And this type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds in this manner. Because one needle, or two, or about that number is sufficient for their suture.
However, the second type of suture is common, so that you gather with the suture the extremities of four: two extremities of skin and two silk threads in place of one, with a needle on which an equal thread is wound in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have penetrated these four extremities with the needle, bring the needle back from the side where you began, so that the thread falls and remains at the upper part of the wound; thus let the suture be like the suture of a cloth by which clothes are sewn together. And put between each entire suture the thickness of a little finger.  />
This type of suture is known to people.
And with this suture I healed a man of the wound which had happened to him in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife; and there was a rupture of the wound greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had come out, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.  />  />
I therefore returned after his intestine protruded from the wound for twenty-four hours.
The wound was therefore healed after about fifteen days, and I treated it, and he was cured; and he lived many years afterward, converted to his own ways.
And the physicians judged that he would not be cured.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with an ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any medicine at all. I therefore placed an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and I continued to wash it with honey water until it was healed.
I will describe two proper types of suture according to the account of the text.
And it is that you begin with an acute suture: and you insert the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
Therefore, when the needle has penetrated the skin and into the flesh along the length and width of the entire body: leave the end of the thread on one side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer part at the opposite end.
Therefore, when you have made it penetrate in this way at that end from the outer part to the inner part: leave the thread on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other end from the inner part to the outer part; and with your penetration as you are making it penetrate into the thread at the opposite end, which is in its place, until it penetrates completely.  />
Then begin again from that same side, and bring it together with the end which is from the thread on the opposite side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it had penetrated.  />
Then bring it back into that skin, and join the thread on one side with this end of the thread; and withdraw it from the skin which is on that side, and do this once and again; and continue to do this alternately, until you have brought everything together completely in this way.
And the essence of this stitch is like the stitches used by tanners to draw skins together; so that you should make a suture once from one end of the skin, and leave it in place on the other side, until you complete it.
The second type of proper stitch, which Galen called.
This is the narrative of its description, and it should be made similarly to how some physicians make it, so that they bring together every part with its fitting counterpart by nature: and they apply one end of the thread to the other end of it, and one end of the needle to the other end. And this is done according to what I tell you.
You should pierce the needle into the end of the thread nearest to you from the outside, and make it penetrate inside in this way only; and leave two ends of the thread. Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside through both ends of the thread, that is, on both sides.
Then turn both and make them penetrate from the inside to the outside through the other two ends of the thread, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of stitching is better than the common easy one, and it is the stitch which was mentioned before.
This then is also the narrative of Galen.
And some said: The stitching of the belly is done with two needles.  /> That is, you insert one thread into both of them; and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the stitching of those who equally sew skins.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of a wound's treatment is the same as that for other wounds.
Because when you get a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air changes it: and bring out the intestines, and sew them up, and apply suitable remedies: then place powdered incense on it.
But if the air has already changed the wound, then place upon it certain ointments that you have at hand, until they produce pus; and the threads fall out, and the sutures (or stitches) strengthen, and heal (or close up). Then care for it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
But if the remedies are not at hand, then place upon it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old linen cloth: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
For you do not need another treatment for most conditions when the wounds are simple (or straightforward).
But if you fear that the wound might communicate with the main parts (or vital organs) in an injury, then it is necessary to soak soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil: and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If he feels pain or pangs or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens), then give him an enema with black, warm, astringent wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestines and caused an exit wound through to its cavity.
And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and what comes from the small (intestines) is more difficult to heal.
The intestine called the jejunum does not accept healing at all from a wound that occurs in it: and this is because of its great number of veins and their size, and because of the thinness of its body, and the closeness of its nature to the nerves (or nervous system).
If, however, that which comes out of the wound is the zirb (i.e., a piece of bowel), and you acquire it freshly: bring it back according to your reduction, by which you bring back the bowels equally.
If, however, the time has passed and it is now green or black, then it is necessary that you bind it with a thread above the place where it became darkened, so that there will not be a flow of blood. For in the zirb (i.e., piece of bowel) there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature and place the two ends of the thread hanging from below the wound outside it, so that its traction upon you may be relieved, and to prevent adhesion at the site of the bowel and emission of pus from the wound.
§ A reminder of a wound that occurs in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people; for I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly with the thrust of a spear, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound became old, and it formed a fistula, and from it came excretion and flatulence.
Therefore, I applied treatment until I was confident about his healing; nor did I cease to investigate him, until he was healed and the place was strengthened.
After I saw the place was already strengthened, I feared for the patient lest he suffer an accidental evil in his belly; and no accidental evil happened to him from that. › And he remained in his better condition, eating and drinking, having intercourse, and entering the bath, and he practiced his regular activities. ›
And now some of the experimenters said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it ought to be tied up in this manner. And it is that you should take large-headed ants. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant with its mouth open upon the two lips of the wound. When it bites into it, and closes its mouth, cut off its head; for it sticks there and does not come loose.
Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to do this with ants, one after another, according to the size of the whole wound.
Then bring it back, and let the wound close. For those heads remain attached within the intestine until the intestines have digested them and healed, and no harm comes to the patient at all.
And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread; that is, what has been cleansed from the intestines of an animal and attached with it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is that you should take the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove the flesh much. Then tie a fine, thin linen thread at its end. ⋅ Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew with it along with the intestine. Then bring it back to its break.
And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Know that a large, wide wound, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no remedy except for scraping away, and its healing does not happen at all.
¶ On the care of goiters and fistulas.
Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and always emits pus, and is not cut away: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And indeed a fistula is truly a hard, white, perforated swelling with no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather; and because of this, some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And there are certain hours in which it becomes moist, emitting pus. And perhaps the moisture divides in certain hours. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes scarce; it can be thick, or thin.
And I have already mentioned this in the division, when I said 'wounds', that every ulcer which does not heal and does not generate flesh is caused by one of nine causes.
One of these causes is either due to the scarcity of blood in the body, or its corruption; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the generation of flesh; or because it contains much dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance sent to it is of poor quality; or because the medicine used for its treatment is unsuitable; or because the falling corruption in that region is of a pestilential nature, or due to a property of the region, as occurs in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is difficult and the healing of apostemes is delayed by nature; or because there is a bone within it, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, as well as their treatments with medicines, in the division; and here it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment of fistulas and ulcers that is done by the way of surgical intervention with the hand.
Know then that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body. For there are fistulas which reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the liver; or the intestines, or the bladder, or one of the ribs; or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints formed by the composition, such as the hand and foot; and there are those which extend to the vicinity of the main member, and similar ones.  />
This fistula, according to this method, is difficult to heal due to the disease, and does not accept treatment; dealing with it is laborious and full of ignorance.
But if the fistula is of any kind whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe made of iron or copper, if the fistula extends straight, and search with it.
However, if there is a curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with a lead probe of fine quality. Because lead, due to its softness, adapts and bends around the curvature.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate its location with a probe. Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from among its openings.
For the liquid with which you irrigate it passes towards the other openings and flows out of them.
Then carefully investigate according to the way that it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the depth of the fistula is distant or near; or whether the fistula is one whose openings are many, and stand over all of it, with your greatest strength: with your questioning of the patient, by which you ask the sick person, and with the discovery of pain upon pressing with your hand on the place, and similar indications and accidental causes.
When you have stood over all these things with true positioning, then go to treatment with confidence. And consider then, if the fistula is appearing near or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you; then cut the fistula as was previously stated from my account, and remove what is in it by filtration, and rotten flesh that grows in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.  />
If, however, the fistula is of great depth and straight, then it is necessary that you cut as much of it out as possible. Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply a bandage soaked in sharp medicine and insert it until it reaches the hollow of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron; do this several times, until the sharp medicine has eaten away all that remains in the hollow of the fistula from the corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it heals.
If it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have described.
Therefore, if the cause of the fistula is a bone and it is certain to you, then search for it and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from the vein, nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Therefore, if a bone is revealed to you and there is some corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed. Then treat it with what promotes healing until it heals.
If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before, then know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption.
Therefore, examine it again and make a very careful scraping and cleansing of it with all your strength.
Then treat it.  /> If it heals, that is good; if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body which you have not reached. You therefore lack skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If the bone is small and possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
If indeed there are many bones, then make a careful extraction of all of them, and do not let any slip by with your strength.
If however something from the moisture is causing trouble for you and there is no fear or error in their incisions, then cut those moistures and flesh if they are present, and free the bones.
If however you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place something on the wound to cause it to putrefy; and leave it until what is around those bones from flesh and moisture putsrefies.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal over. And let the cut which you have made in your work be constricted. Or if you are afraid, place on it a cloth soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointment.
For when those moistures have putrefied and the bones have been separated from them, their removal is made easier and their extraction also.
But if it is a large bone, such as the shinbone or the hipbone, and part of it has become corrupted; then scrape it with the finest rasp until that blackness and corruption are removed. Then restore the wound.
But if what is corrupted in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely up to the place where the corruption reaches; then care for it until it heals over.  />   />   />
And I tell you a story which happened to a man in his leg; so that you may use it as an example and assistance for your work.
There was a young man about thirty years old, who had pain in his leg from an internal cause that moved within him; that is, from the inside, until the material reached his leg and it swelled up with a large swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, time passed with error on the part of the physicians until the abscess burst, and many substances gathered with it. And his cure was delayed until the leg became ulcerated and many openings formed in it, which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Therefore, many physicians attended to him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them until I was called, and I saw his leg and the substances flowing from those openings in great quantity; indeed, all his body had already withered away, and his color was jaundiced.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings and the probe reached the mouth.
Then I investigated all the openings and found that they were interconnected to each other from every part of the leg.
Therefore I hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed part of the bone, and found it corrupt, that it had already rotted away and blackened, and become putrid, and penetrated all the way to the marrow.  />
I therefore sawed off what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
And I judged that there was nothing else in the bone except for that corruption which I cut away and sawed off. And I had already rooted it out.
Then I applied a wound dressing with consolidating medicines for a long time.  />  And it did not heal.  
Then I probed again and exposed the bone a second time above the first exposure, and found continuous corruption with the bone, and sawed off what appeared to me from that corruption as well.
Then I attempted to dress it. And it did not heal.
Therefore I exposed it again and did not stop cutting the bone piece by piece and trying to dress it, and it did not heal until I had cut away about a hand's breadth of bone with its marrow.
Then I restored him with medicines, and he was quickly consolidated and healed. This repetition of the operation and section would not have been necessary except for the weak condition of the patient, his limited tolerance, and my fear of his death; because he was experiencing syncope from excessive evacuation at all hours.
Thus he was completely cured; and a strong, good flesh grew in the place of the bone; his body became well-proportioned, and his strength returned; he resumed his normal habits; and there was no damage at all to his walking.
But if the projecting bone has already been broken off in the body, then you must sew it up in this way: Take a string and tie it to the end of the projecting bone; and command someone to pull it upward; and place another thicker woolen thread over the first string. Then tie it over the flesh that is next to the bone; and extend its end so as to pull the flesh downward; and you will uncover the flesh over the place where you wish to sew, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Place a piece of wood or board under the bone properly; for when you do this, it will not prevent the saw from cutting through the rotten flesh.
And the sawing should be slightly above the rotten spot, so that the rot is not in a hollow of the bone; and it does not appear to the touch, and thus induces an alternate method of sawing.
But if the bone is rotten and does not project outward, but rather continues connected to another part; and the rot is in its middle or side; then uncover all the flesh from all sides completely. Then place a piece of wood underneath.
Then saw through it from the first side where there is rot, until the sawing reaches the other side; and let the sawing be slightly longer than the rot, as we have said.
If corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
However, if corruption is between two joints, then there is no skill in that except to scrape it off.
But if corruption is in the comb of the hand or the comb of the foot, then the matter is very difficult. Indeed, you must examine how the corruption appears to you. And scrape it off, and clean it as best you can with whatever skill is available to you: when the vein or nerve does not work against you.
And know that there are many different cutting tools and saws for cutting these bones, depending on the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness or thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and softness. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable tool for each type of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of tool you need when your study is prolonged.  /> And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of diseases, then indeed you will find through yourself what suits it from the instruments for every ailment.
And I assure you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will use as examples for what you cut, and a test by which you try others.
The shape of another saw.
The form of the knife for joints. Let the head of this knife be in the shape of a star-headed nail: and its points should be in the shape of the points of the elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except to smooth the heads of joints when they are injured, whether a large or great bone is present.
The form of the larger knife.
The form of the broad knife.
The form of the knife which has a concavity.
The form of another fine knife.
The form of another knife with a curved tip.
The form of the small and delicate needle-like knife.
This resembles a file, and its tip is like a saw; it is used in many places for the sake of cutting bones. xspace
The form of the knife suitable for removing that which has been perforated from the bone.
Its tip is triangular and its points are sharp.
It is made of iron. And similarly, all that we have mentioned should be made from knives and saws.
¶ On the cutting of tips and sawing of bones.
The tips become putrid either from an external cause or from an internal one.  /> Caput XC.
Therefore, when you have treated that putrefaction with medicines and the treatment does not help, and you see the putrefaction spread into a limb which is not affected by anything else: then it is necessary for you to cut off that limb up to where the putrefaction has reached, so that the patient may escape from death or from the greater evil of loss of the limb.
And the sign of that which occurs is that the member darkens until it appears to be burnt by fire or decayed after blackening; until that decay spreads to the point where it follows that member and creeps throughout the whole body.
Therefore, hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of decay is from the bite of certain venomous creatures, such as the marine scorpion, viper, or asp, and similar ones.
If therefore the decay or bite is on the tip of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the decay to advance to the rest of the hand.
And similarly, if it occurs on the hand, then cut it off at the root of the wrist, and do not leave space for the decay to reach the forearm.
And if it invades that [forearm], then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
If, however, the decay passes through and you see it around the elbow, then death is certain for the patient. And beyond that, administering from the treatment is a matter of skill.
And similarly, do the same with the foot when decay invades a toe; then cut it off at one of the joints. If it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the entire foot. If it however advances to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
When decay has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill [to save him], except to abandon and leave the patient to death.
And the method of cutting or sawing a member is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut and tie another ligature above that place. And let one assistant pull the lower ligature downward, and let another assistant pull the upper ligature upward. And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is laid bare. Then it should be cut or sewn.
And you should place a cloth of linen over all parts, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area; and it may happen that an additional injury is inflicted on the sick person, and a hot abscess forms.
But if bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area, or place some powders that absorb blood on it. Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and care for it until it heals.
And I tell you that this happened to a man on his foot, the same event as I am telling you.
Which is to say that a blackening occurred on his foot, similar to the burning of fire; and this corruption first began in his toe until it spread to his entire foot.
Therefore the man hastened to cut himself off, after he saw that the corruption was advancing into his limb with great intensity, which he found from the pain and burning of it; and he cut himself at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in his index finger of his hand.
So he came to me, and I tried to draw out that excess with the ointment I placed on his hand after cleansing his body; but the swelling did not subside, and began spreading to another finger until the corruption spread to the whole hand.
So he called upon me to cut off his hand; and I refused, hoping for the subsiding of that swelling from me; and I also feared death at cutting off his hand. ➤ Because the man's strength was greater than the condition.
So after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land; and news came to me about him that he had hastened and cut off his whole hand; and he was healed.
And I did not bring forward this narrative except to be of assistance concerning that which falls under the category of this illness: and so that it may serve as a signifier by which is indicated, and according to which one should act.
About caring for the sinuses, and the quality of enema administration with medications.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or perforates, and what is within it comes out as pus, and the place remains empty like a vessel: and the skin that is above it is like a cloth that has already been made thin: and it does not reach to the end in its corruption, neither imprinting on a bone, nor on a nerve, nor on a ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula. However, if its space is prolonged until the corruption imprints on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula or fistula.
And its treatment is that you should cut off all that skin as if you were rolling it up: and especially when it has been made thin, like a cloth: and you trust that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin adheres, and it does not follow from this final corruption; and if there is thickness in the skin of flesh, then treat it with an enema: and it is as if for a sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then enema it with Egyptian medication, which is vinegar, oil, and sumac, receiving equal parts, gathered together in a vessel; and boil them over fire until the medication becomes red: and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take what you need from it, dissolve it with water and honey, and use this mixture as an enema for the bladder; then tie off its opening and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Then draw it out with a suppository. Do this for as many days as are necessary until the bladder is cleansed and the stench removed.
And sometimes it should be irrigated with ashes water when this medicine is not available to you. Take the ashes of vine wood or holm oak wood and pour them over the water. Then strain it and use it for an enema until you are confident that the bladder is now clean.
But if the patient cannot bear the Egyptian medicine or ashes water, then use an enema of water and honey into which some powdered ginger has already been mixed. Or irrigate it with a mixture of honey and wine, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine causes the bladder to adhere, especially when the wine is somewhat astringent and dry.
When you have done this several times and are confident that the corruption of the bladder has been removed, then irrigate it with what causes flesh to grow there.
And this is done by taking some diachylon plaster and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine; or you can irrigate it with certain other medicines and ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
But if the opening of the bladder is too narrow to accept an enema cannula, then dilate it briefly with an iron instrument; or insert into it a tampon wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicum ointment until it is sufficiently dilated.
And similarly, if the opening is also large, then gather its lips with a stitch; and leave from it the amount into which a clyster may enter without addition.
And similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is elevated upwards; then cut into it in the deeper part that is within it, so that the pus may flow downwards: for when pus is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus lower as you wish; then strive to prepare the membrane with a preparation that allows the pus to flow easily according to how it is prepared for you. Strive that nothing at all of the pus be retained within it; and take healing ointments which are applied to the wound, suitable for what you wish. And spread them on a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such size that it may cover the entire Sinus. Then cut with scissors a hole directly in the orifice of the Sinus, a little wider than the orifice of the Sinus. Then spread gentle ointments on another cloth according to the size of the hole; and place it over the Sinus, distant from its orifice, so that the exit of the pus from it may be relieved; and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days once.
But the one that is over the orifice of the Sinus; it is this one which you remove in every hour, so that what accumulates within it from pus may exit; and so that you may know whether that which flows out of it is much or little; or digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself; whether the master of it feels pain within it, or if there is no pain in it, and whether there is a swelling within it, or if there is no swelling in it.
When your treatment is extended in this manner and you see the material exiting from the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus has adhered or is approaching adhesion; therefore, dissolve it in the morning or on the third day. And when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth for another one and renew the ointment.
But if a thin pus exits from the sinus after a long period, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are people who slow down the growth of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
But if after many days an undigested pus exits from the sinus, then know that the sinus has not adhered.
If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its course prolonged, then add to the drying of medicines; but let the physicians make sure that the medicines are humid in their substance and dry in their power, like the ointment called dyafinicon when a superfluous amount of egg is added.
And from the above-mentioned treatment, it is that you should take the ointment called dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and pour over it an equal amount of old wine in its substance.
Then prepare it with this, and use it.
And now perform a similar action when you do not have the ointment called dyafinicon present; for honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it. Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; grind all of them together and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire. Then line it with a cloth and tie it over the sinus; and line it with the honey you have boiled until it thickens, and powder over it spices, and place a cloth over it, and tie it.  ///
And sometimes it is given with long birthwort, and root of the heavenly lily, and lily: and flour of the herb, and centaurie. Use them either as simples or mixed together; pound them and sift them; then powderize over the honey I mentioned, and use it.
But if the abscess is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, then know that there is a corruption in its depth; either it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments; then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, as has been mentioned before.  /> 133
On the care of a whitlow and crushed nail, and the cutting of the finger, and its sectioning.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the thumbnail of the hand or foot; and perhaps it can arise in the other fingers as well.
But when the abscess is prolonged and its treatment is neglected and it becomes a hot abscess; or it is corrupted and emits pus until it gnaws at the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, so that there is a foul odor; and the tip of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it with what we said in the section on division, and your treatment is not effective; then you must cut off with a knife all the remaining excess from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For cautery is very beneficial.  /> 135 
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of the nail now press the flesh inward and begin to prick it and hurt it; then you must place a fine wire under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut off that part of the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the medicinal substances that burn and corrode until all of it is removed. Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
But if the corruption has already begun in the ulcer, then it is necessary that you cut into that ulcer and remove it; for it will never heal as long as there remains a corrupted ulcer within it.
If you see the gangrene and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, as was mentioned earlier in its description. Then care for it until it heals.
But if it happens that the nail is worn down or struck: and there arises a severe pain from it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first. Then cut the nail with an acutely pointed spatula, making a transverse section from top to bottom as you see fit.
And take care that the section does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause a very severe pain to occur through this over the patient, and there will be an additional cause of scarring in that place.
Then care for the place with something that soothes the pains.
But the extra finger that is born in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and sometimes it is born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some of the finger's joints. Therefore, that which is born in some of the finger's joints does not move; and that which is born at the finger's joint, perhaps moves.
The section of those which are fleshy is easy. Which is to say: cut it at its root with a broad spatula.  /> Et sic de iuncturae addita: et similiter quae sunt in manibus aliorum, et est eisdem remediis curanda, et idem est modus curandi eorum.
However, the cure for that whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult. Avoid cutting it.
But if it is born on a finger at the last joint, then you should cut its flesh with a round incision right up to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those suitable saws for it. Then care for it until it heals.
A contraction that occurs between fingers can often happen due to a birth defect, that is, it is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or a burn from fire, and similar causes.  />
Therefore, you must cut away that contraction until the fingers return to their natural shape. Then place between them bandages or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly heal together, and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place heals as it should.
And similarly, if a contraction occurs between some fingers and the palm, then cut away that contraction according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
¶ On the incision of a tumor.
Veins are swollen, thick, full of melancholic excesses that occur in many parts of the body; and most of their occurrences are in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and workers and bearers.
Therefore, you must administer a purgative made from black bile several times with a strong laxative.
Then bleed the patient from those veins.
Their treatment with iron is in two ways.  /> ● If it is on a small part of the body or not very swollen: then incise it gently, and extract what is inside it, and cauterize it so that it does not swell again.  /> ● But if it is large or very swollen: then cut away its skin, and take out what is in it, and stitch up the wound with silk thread until the swelling goes down. 》 One of these methods is to cut them open and extract the black blood. And another method is to lift the vein and remove it entirely.
Its section is according to this manner. First, soak the leg with very hot water until the thick and feculent blood dissolves. Then tie off the patient's leg from the top of the thigh to below the knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, with a wide incision.
Then lift, that is, draw out the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and first of all, let the phlebotomist bleed the patient. Then cut the nail along with it below: until enough blood comes out as you see fit and which the patient's strength can bear.
Afterwards, tie it off and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile. Repeat the evacuation and bloodletting whenever the veins are full and it harms the patient.
Its lifting is according to this manner. Shave the leg of the patient if it has many hairs. Then put the patient into a bath or soak his leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell, or if there is no bath available, exercise strongly until the limb warms up.
Then cut the skin along the length of the vein's path: either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until it is visible to the touch, and at its appearance you will see it redden towards blackness. When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Then insert under it a reed until when lifted and emerges from the skin; hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Then cut another incision near that incision three fingers wide. Then scrape away the skin from above the vein until it appears. Then lift it with tongs as you did before, and hang it with another hook as you did at first.
Then cut another incision or several more if you need to. Then lift it and cut it off at the last incision near the heel.
Then draw it out to the incision above it.
And do this until you draw it out from the uppermost or all of the incisions, when it comes out entirely; then cut it off.
But if it does not obey you by being drawn out and lifted up, then insert a needle with a strong double thread and tie it off, and draw it out; or insert under it a hook: and turn your hand to every side until it comes out. And be careful that it is not cut.  /> For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to lift it up, and harm may come to the patient from that.
When you have drawn it out entirely, then place over the wound a woolen cloth soaked in wine and rose oil or oil, and care for him until he is healed.
But if the vein is constricted and has a tortuous course which it follows to its parts, and is not straight as we have said, then you must slit over it along every part of its tortuous course and places of its twisting.
Then hang it with hooks until you lift it all out; and be careful at your incision above it that you do not cut the vein or injure it, for it will become very difficult for you to lift or draw it out. Therefore keep your discretion.
The Shape of a Wound that is Healed by a Wine-based Remedy.
The shape of a blind tumor.
It does not have the convexity of other tumors, nor the sharp extremities so as not to wound a vein; and it is large and twisted, soft: because if it were thin, it would pierce the vein with its thinness; but it must have excessive thickness, as we said.
On the Extraction of the Vein of the Leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi and the Arabian land, and in dry, hot lands where there is little tenderness, that is, where neither grass nor trees grow.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs. xspace
And its generation is due to putrefaction occurring under the skin, just as happens within bodies with serpents and worms called ascarids, and the worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein's appearance is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg. Then the spot becomes blistered. Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistered spot, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
Therefore, when its extremity becomes visible from that, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm and two nqbats, and leave the suspended lead hanging from the leg.
So whenever something emerges out of it to the outside, wrap that in lead and tie it up. If it becomes very long, then cut off a piece of it and wrap the rest. And do not cut it off at its root before all of it has emerged.  ?> If you cut, it contracts and enters into the flesh, causing an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad sore.
Therefore, it should be treated gently and extracted gradually until it comes out from its last part, so that nothing remains of it in the body; and this vein, in certain people, extends to a length of five palms and ten. And now it has come to me because it came out of a man from twenty palms.
But if it is cut during your treatment time, then insert a reed into its opening and perforate it with a long hole along with the body until everything that is in it from matter is evacuated; and administer treatments for putrefaction of the place for several days. Then treat him according to the method for treating abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle or in the foot itself; and there are many openings for it, and from each opening a branch comes out.
Therefore treat it as we have said in the division, along with what was stated beforehand.
¶ On cutting above worms generated under the skin, which is called bovine disease.
This disease is called in a certain land among us bovine disease because it often happens to cows and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it goes through the entire body, ascending and descending; and it is felt when walking from member to member until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin and comes out.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. Just as worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms, occur in the belly.  />
And fear is caused by its malignancy. Because when it goes into the body and is raised to the head and reaches that place, then perhaps it opens up there and exits, and destroys the eye, and this often happens.
Therefore, when you want to cure it and extract it, this is only done during its movement and appearance to the senses.
You must therefore tie strongly with a ligature what is above it and what is below it. Then cut above it and extract it.
But if it goes deep into the flesh and you cannot find it, then put a cautery with fire on that place until it dies.
And what is even more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see that it has already reached near the eye at the head, then tie a good ligature under it on the eyebrow. Then cut above it and extract it. abei
And the patient must use bodily cleansing with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
And he should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ On the incision for Nakir's disease.
This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from one limb to another.
And I myself have already seen this, as I am telling you. I was called to a sick woman in certain villages. beyi beyi And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling on the tendon of the arm vein.
And after I remained for one hour, I saw a swelling go forth like a caterpillar, moving quickly up her arm to the shoulder faster than is possible, just as silver moves when it runs from place to place.
The pain then retreated from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Then I sat for an hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Then he told me that it was turning throughout his whole body, as I saw.
So I marveled at the speed with which it changed from member to member. And truly, before that, I had never seen this illness in my eyes acting in such a way. However, I have seen many people in whom pain was transferred from member to member; but I had never seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that this happened except because she was one of those women with dry bodies and visible veins; from which it seems to the senses that the wind was transferred.
And it is necessary that these do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.  />
Therefore, when you want to treat it and the patient feels that pain, then if it is visible to your eye as we have said, quickly tie above it and below it; and cut above it until that wind comes out constricted; and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with bodily evacuation and with what expels winds and binds them with fetid pills, and pills of serpentaria, and similar things.
§ On the Extraction of Arrows.  />
Arrows are distinguished by their kinds and by the places where they fall from the body.
Their diversity is such that some have large heads and others small; some are hollow and others solid. And among them are those which have three angles. And among these are tongues. And among these are stars.
However, those which fall according to the members are of two kinds. For the members are either from the principal hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar things. Therefore, when it falls into one of these members and the signs of death, which I will tell you later, appear to you, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, because death follows him in whom it is, in many cases. And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits through the fontanel on top of the brain are: because there occurs from it a severe headache, blindness in one eye, dizziness, redness of the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion, and vomiting of bile. And perhaps blood will come out of the nose or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice destroyed. And a white fluid like dough comes out of the place of the wound. And from it comes something resembling the wateriness of meat.  />
If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating it, and extract the arrow if it has not exited.
The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple and feels as if it is stuck in a hard thing, not an empty one. And perhaps there is a movement in the arrow similar to the pulse and black blood runs from the wound.  /> 89463217 And it is followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting. You should know that death has certainly come.
And the sign of an arrow wound to the lung is that blood-froth comes out of the wound; and the veins that follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the sick person changes. And he exhales a great deal of air with great force; and seeks to inhale cold air.
If the arrow falls on the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it is close to the small ribs; and there is a great gasping with severe pain and sighing; and all the limbs of the shoulders tremble.
And if the arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out of the wound from food.
And if the arrow falls on the belly and pierces it, then something of fecal matter comes out of the wound, or an intestine that has already been torn. There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
If the arrow falls on the bladder and urine comes out; and something comes out of it to the outside, and the pain is greater on the sick person; then you should know that it is fatal.
The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and shoulder joint, and back of the loins, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and others like them from the limbs are healed according to various dispositions; when the arrow does not find a main artery or nerve; and is not a poisoned arrow. 》 》
And I tell you that I have seen of these arrows, in order for you to know through this concerning your cure.
That is, because a certain man had an arrow fall on his tear duct at the root of his nose. I removed it from her other side, under the fat of her ear; and she was healed, and no harm came to her eye.
I also removed an arrow from a Jew that had fallen into his eyelid fat under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not get anything but its small end, which was attached to its shaft: and it was a large arrow of the Turkish bows, with a soft iron tip, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil befell his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat.
And it was an Arab arrow, and that is the type with barbs. I cut, therefore, above it between the two rings: and it was already sunk into his throat. Therefore, I became skilled with it, until I removed it; and the Christian was healed. />
And I removed another arrow from a man that had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Therefore, after thirty days had passed and nothing changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow; and I sharpened it, and removed it; and he was healed, and no evil befell him.
And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound over it had become healed. Therefore, after seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the base of his thigh.
And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound over it had become healed, and the arrow remained inside her; and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face; the wound hardened and remained, causing him little pain. There were many similar cases like this.
And I removed an arrow from a man who was one of the king's nobles; it had struck him in the middle of his nose and slightly deviated to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
I was therefore called to treat him three days after the incident with the arrow. I found that the arrow wound was very tight.
So I examined it with a fine probe and did not feel it; the man himself found pain and discomfort under his right ear. Therefore, I hoped that this was a point of exit from the tip of the arrow.
I then applied a plaster with attracting and digesting powers to the area, hoping that the wound would suppurate and reveal to me the sign of the arrow so that I could cut over it; but this did not happen, indicating that the arrow had not reached that location.
I continued to apply the plaster for many days, and no discharge occurred; the wound healed, but the man remained weak from the arrow's removal for some time until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. And he told me about it.
And he told me about it. So I placed a sharp, corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until it opened up; and when I probed it with a probe, I felt the tip of the arrow attached to the wood.
Then I continued to widen the wound with that sharp medicine until we could see the tip of the arrow visibly; and this process took about four months.
Then after the wound had been widened enough to allow me to insert forceps into it and move the arrow, but it did not exit; I did not stop refining and inventing methods for removing it until one day I began with well-made forceps, as will be shown in their form at the end of this chapter, until I removed it. Then I repaired the wound.
And indeed, doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored. Therefore I repaired it (the cartilage of the nose), and the wound was healed, and the patient was restored to full health; nothing whatever harmed him.
And I tell you about the method of extracting certain arrows: so that you may use this as a rule and understanding for what I did not say.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended by mere narrative; nor does the book comprehend them, but a skillful craftsman compares a little to much, and what is present to what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument in dealing with external things of this art when they occur.  />
I say therefore that arrows do not exit from the members to which they are fixed except in two ways. Either by retracing their path back out of the place where they entered. Or through the opposite side (of the body).
And those that exit where they entered are either arrows passing through fleshy parts, which can be drawn out and exit.  />
But if it does not yield to exit at the time it fell, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrefies, and its extraction will be facilitated, along with its exit.
Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to you for extraction, then leave it also for some days; and every day try to extract it with traction and motion, until it comes out.
But if after several days it does not yield to you for extraction, then you must bore around the arrow in the bone itself from all sides with a fine awl, until the arrow becomes enlarged. Then draw it out and extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden in some part of the body and is concealed and hidden from sense, then seek it out with a probe. But if you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the length of the arrow deep inside, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then cut open above it until the wound is widened and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
But if there are ears (i.e., pieces of flesh) by which it is held, then free the attached flesh from every side and in every way you can manage to do that, and if it cannot be extracted because of the breaking of the ears and their twisting, then persist until it comes out. )))
And when you administer the extraction of an arrow in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps on all parts until you make it come out; and be subtle with the utmost subtlety so that the arrow does not break and its attraction and extraction become difficult for you.
If you cannot cut it in one hour, then leave it for some days until what surrounds it decays. Then repeat the process; the swelling will be relieved. However, if the flow of blood is causing difficulty for you, then administer what we said in its own chapter on treatment: and guard your virtue from cutting a vein or nerve or sinew.
And administer the medicine in every way that is possible for you to evade the arrow: and let it be with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that when you draw the arrow, it should be weakened according to the figure as it was at the time of the arrow wound itself. Because it is more beneficial. If this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
If the arrow comes out of the opposite part, or something is already protruding to the outside, or if it forms a swelling at the tip of the arrow that you can feel under the skin and see it protruding, cut above it; let the incision be according to the size that the forceps can grasp in it.  ()
Then draw it out, for it becomes easy to remove.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and enlarges its own opening; then draw it out.
And if not, leave it for some days; then repeat the process until it comes out.
If the arrow has a wooden shaft, then push it out with its shaft.  ()
But if the wooden shaft has broken off and you wish to administer a push, then insert into it a concave instrument so that its concavity enters into the tail of the arrow; then push it out with it.  ()  ()  ()  ()
If however the arrow is barbed, then push it through with an entering instrument. For the arrow should be removed by that means.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh in which the poison is located, if it is possible for you. Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow falls into the chest or belly or bladder or side and is close to the surface so that you can feel it with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it, then cut, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then treat the wound, if you see it, until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
The ends should be like the beak of a bird and made in such a way that when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
And many forms are made from them, large and small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its narrowness, and the width of the wound and its narrowness.
The form of the pushing instrument for barbed arrows.
And the form of the pushing instrument for blunt arrows.
This is the end of the blunt arrow like a radius, so that its entry into a barbed arrow may be facilitated and it may be pushed with it.  />
¶ On the bleeding of veins.  />
There are thirty veins that run in the body and into which it is customary to bleed.
Of which there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear in both temples; and two veins in both tear ducts of the eyes, which are called the watchers; and one prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and one vein at the tip of the nose. And two veins of Guidugi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins that are in the lower lip. And these are the veins which are called Algecherich. And two veins that are under the tongue.
But the veins which are bled in the arms are five in each arm.
One of them is called the cephalic vein and it comes from the outer side; and the common people name it the head vein.  /> And the dark one. And it is the median vein and it is formed from a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein; and the common people call it the body vein. And the basilic vein, which is situated on the inner side, and is also called the tickler. And the common people call it the belly vein. And the cord of the arm, which is situated over the axilla; and that is the one which is bled, and it appears clearly above the thumb.
And the little saver: and it is a vein between the ring finger and the little finger, and there are two branches of it.
And in the leg and foot there are three veins.  />  />  /> One of them is the one which is under the arch of the thumb on the outer side.  />  /> And the second one is the saphenous vein, and its location is near the heel on the inner side. And the nessian vein; and its place is near the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ About the bleeding of two veins behind the ears.
However, the bleeding of two veins that are behind the ears is beneficial for old coughs, and headaches, and sahafati, and long-standing bad sores on the head.
And the manner of bloodletting it is as I will tell you. And it is done by shaving the head of the patient; and his occipital region where the two veins are located should be rubbed with a rough cloth using good friction. Then the patient should tie their neck with a band, until the two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears in the two depressed areas of the head. Seek them therefore with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that spot with encaustic paint.
Then take the bloodletting knife, which is called the incisor. Then insert it under the vein into the skin, until the bloodletter reaches the mouth of the vein. Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin using an incising cut. And let the length of the incision be two fingers' breadths joined together, or about that: and allow as much blood to flow out as you wish.
Then tie it with small bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And now at the beginning of the book there has been explained the cutting of them and their own cauterization.
The bloodletting of the two arteries in the temples is beneficial for chronic migraine; and for recurrent dizziness; and for persistent headache; and for the flow of acute discharges to the eyes. ■
And the manner of bloodletting them is as I will tell you. Let the patient tighten their neck strongly, until the two veins become clearly visible to the touch; and let their pulse be felt under your finger. ■ ■ Then mark it with encaustic paint.
Then lift up the skin with your index finger above the vein and insert a lancet underneath it, and lift up the vein above. And cut it, as you did with the two other veins: and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the binding of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for one hour. Then put a cloth and bandages on it and bind it tightly above; and leave it until it heals.
And now the description of them, their cutting, and their extraction has been mentioned at the beginning of this book.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is after cephalic phlebotomy for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and redness, and foul ulcers.
And its quality is as I tell you. Let the patient bind their neck with a band until the vein appears. Then take the instrument called a scarifier. ¶
Place the projecting point of the scarifier on the vein and strike it with a comb or something similar, allowing the blood to flow according to your will. Then loosen the patient's binding and bind it until it heals.
Sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet. However, it should not be a sharp-pointed lancet like the others; rather, it should have a broad point. And cut the lancet according to the direction of the vein, because the mouth is nearby; and perhaps a thin lancet will break when it is there. ¶ ¶
The affliction of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of both eyes is for eye disease from scabies and redness: it causes blindness in the eye and facial pain.
And the method of bleeding them is that the patient tightens his own neck with a cord. Then perform the bloodletting on these veins, and you should be standing over their head.
And let the bloodletting be done transversely along its length a little bit, with a small fleam, wide a little bit, for there is no flesh in that place. For if the fleam is too fine at the tip, it might break.
Then let as much blood flow out as you deem necessary. And place a bandage over them, and bind them for one night, and then remove the bindings.
The veins of the nose are beneficial for acute fever, severe headache, and facial pain, such as migraine and facial redness, especially when chronic.
And the method of bleeding them is that the patient tightens his own neck. xspace Then hold the patient's nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long fleam, and insert it into the middle of the lip between the two parts that divide the nose along its length. Because the vein is not visible or palpable there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately. xspace ething
And you must hold your hand with the fleam a little bit, and let as much blood flow out as necessary. xspace ething ething ething ething ething ething Then bandage it for one night. For it recovers quickly.
The two bloodlettings of Guy are beneficial for constriction of shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, melancholic diseases, impetigo, and bad ulcers, as well as for corrodents, that is, herpetic eczema.
And the method of these bloodlettings is for the patient to tighten both his veins under his collarbone with a ligature; and let the physician stand over the head of the patient, while the patient sits on a stool.
Then the phlebotomist should cut the vein for bloodletting slightly longer than usual. Then draw from the blood a measured amount, or as much as is necessary for that purpose. Then do the same with the other vein.
Afterward, release the ligature and tighten both veins moderately so that the patient is not overly constricted. And leave it thus until morning. For the wound will heal.
About venous bloodletting of Al-Ghafiqi. The bloodletting of the veins of Al-Ghafiqi is beneficial because it helps with a sore throat, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, as well as bad ulcers that are also on the nose and its surroundings.
And the method of these bloodlettings is to have the patient sit before you and tie his neck with a cord. Then turn his lip and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and you can identify each by the blackness of both. And this is true because around them are small, dark veins. Therefore, cut both with a single incision. (): 100)
If however there is doubt about which one it is and you do not know which one it is, then pay attention to the larger of them and the more obvious.
And do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip, for this is the most common practice; and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ On bloodletting: After the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, the veins under the tongue should be bled. The advantage of the bloodletting of these two veins that are under the tongue is that the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for throat diseases and also for mouth disease and other oral diseases.
And the manner of bleeding them is to have the patient sit between your hands in front of the sun, and lift up his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side a vein, and on the other side another vein, and the color of both leans towards blackness.
Therefore, bleed both; and be careful not to finish bleeding them with your hand. For under these [veins] are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries may occur.
And the three veins that are bled in the elbow, the bloodletting of these is commonly practiced on all people.
Their bloodletting is done according to two methods. Either by pricking with a broad myrtle bloodletting needle, or with an olive wood needle that has been planed to sharpness; or by cutting with a surgical knife, which is called Alnesil. And this is its form.
And of these there are broad and fine types according to the size and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle bloodletting needle should be broad, as you see. And it is fitting for opening hollow, full, prominent, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and more delicate in its ends.
And it is fitting for phlebotomy of subtle veins, which contain thin citrine blood.
However, the basilica, which is one of these three veins for phlebotomy, is useful. Because it extracts blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and belly: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be cautious when he phlebotomizes it, because of fear of it, for under it there is an artery. If therefore he errs and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur. Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize her with the phlebotomy needle; rather let him cut with alnacil. 
If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to remove it and replace it with another one, or look for some of its branches; or in place of that vein, the vein of the arm. For it is clear, and cut it with a phlebotomy needle, as we said.
But if you want to phlebotomize that same one, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, to touch the place until you know the place of the pulse. Then mark the place with cautery, afterward constrict the arm, and cut the vein with a concave section using the phlebotomy needle called alnacil, as we said.  And be careful that the incision does not fall into the space of the artery.
And when you see, as you tie the ligature, swelling in the place marked with cautery, then that swelling is of the artery; therefore, avoid it.
If you see blood spurt at the site of venipuncture, as in a child's urine, and it is fine and red; then know that it is from the artery. Then hasten, and place your finger on it for a long time, and afterwards remove your finger. Therefore, if the blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tie off the arm and leave it; and let the patient beware of moving it; and let him be in fear of it.
And do not move it for several days until it heals.
But if the blood does not spurt and it overcomes you; and you do not have a remedy at hand, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.  ​ For its extremities contract, and the blood spurts out.
Or take the bark of a fig tree and pound it; take half of it, and tie it over the vein with a suitable bandage, along with a thread and cotton wool until another day.
Then if the blood spurts out, that is good. And if it does not spurt out, then treat him as described above for the dust that causes blood to flow; and its bleeding is not difficult in many conditions because of the small wound and the possibility of tying off from the arm.
Venipuncture of the dark vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.  ​
And it is suitable for the person drawing blood that they be without fear of bleeding her, for under her is a nerve. Therefore, if he adds to the incision for bleeding and finds a nerve, it happens that she becomes stunned, and her healing becomes difficult, and perhaps she does not heal at all.
And this nerve often appears to the sense of touch. But if in some people it is hidden and subtle and does not show itself, then you should place your bleeding incision where you will bleed her, with the section of Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If a vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
About the cephalic vein. The benefit of bleeding the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein, if you wish, to bleed her by pricking with an olive-wood lancet or a myrtle-wood lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor a nerve.  />
Nevertheless, it is suitable for you when bleeding, that you avoid with the lancet only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it will not harm her if it is not found on the first strike, to repeat the bleeding over her several times.  />  />
Nevertheless, perhaps it swells in some people when not bleed on the first strike, but that swelling does not harm them in any way.
About the usefulness of bleeding and the precautions to be observed in it. The nature and effects of bleeding are from that which you should consider for its correction.
First, therefore, is what you should know: that bloodletting is not done except for the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
And let bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Fusca, and the Basilic. And let bloodletting be done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach; in summer and autumn after eating, when there are signs of fullness.
And let bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from midday.
However, bloodletting that is administered for illnesses does not have a fixed time, but whenever the circumstances and necessity demand it, whether at night or day, at any hour, and in any season.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth to the seventh month. Nor should elderly people who have passed sixty years be bled.  />
Therefore, when someone wants to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the bloodletting with a gentle enema, if there is a lot of retained feces in them, so that the veins do not draw putrid harmful substances from the intestines during the bloodletting into the principal members.  />  />
Nor should a patient be bled who is suffering from nausea, or drunkenness, or recovering from drunkenness, until that condition is removed from them. Nor [should one bleed] a sick person with dropsy.
And one should avoid bleeding again after an attack of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, or anything else that diminishes strength from the body or animal nature.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that: if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines; if it is possible for him to do so.
Then let him enter the bath, unless something prevents him; or he should exercise in some way to refine the blood.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said; and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all evil accidents of the soul, such as anxiety, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, superfluities, and similar things.
And he should have present those things whose use customarily runs in the lives of men for their fragrance, scent, and merriment, and similar things, according to what is possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a chair that is higher than the chair of the one being bled; then he should draw out his arm and rub it with his hand twice or thrice. Then let him tie the band with a cord and wrap it twice.
And let the tightness be moderate, for if the tightness is uneven or too tight, then it prevents the flow of blood; and if it is too loose, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Then after tying, it is necessary for the one being bled to rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the place of the bleeding with a small amount of old oil properly.
Then let him place his left index finger slightly above the vein in the place where he wants to make the incision, so that the vein does not flee and the strike is not missed. For there are veins that flee like a string during phlebotomy, and there are those filled with air; and when you place the incision on them, they contract under the incision, and deceive the phlebotomist, and the incision does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is constricted. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and attentive in all these matters.
Then put aside the phlebotomy. If, therefore, the vein is opened with one stroke, then it is good. And if not, then repeat it with another stroke under that place, or above the same with haste; if the place does not suppurate.
If it suppurates, or if the patient is alarmed, then leave him for a day, or two days; and do not let the ligature be too tight. For perhaps a hot abscess will be drawn out. Let him not enter a bath. 》 Neque comedat cibum nimis frigidum, nec calidum, nec siccum, nec umidum: sed mediocriter temperatum.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
If the opening is small or if the blood flows finely and you fear that not enough will come out, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole along its length, and add a little to the operation.
And do this with haste, before the place suppurates, for a suppurating place is common among many people during a small operation.
If you see that it has already suppurated, then do not repeat at all on top of it, for nothing will be excused to you. And put some olive residue on it, for it will help the flow of blood. 》 Hoc faciet medicus in omni operatione sanguis. And this is better in this place than oil itself and any other kind of oil.
And likewise administer olive residue in every phlebotomy where you forbid the flow of blood; and they do this with theriac, with alfarach, and with saffron, when any one of them is placed on the spot.
For blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
But if a large abscess occurs in the place of phlebotomy - for this often happens, especially to those who are not bled except on that occasion or whose vein opening is small - then hasten and put a sponge soaked in salt water over the spot, heated slightly; and let it remain there for an hour, for it dissolves. 》 Quod si non soluitur, tunc scinde eam et pone aliud super ipsum: quoniam et illud faciet idem.
And it is necessary that you do this after the flow of blood from that vein, with its completion, or from another vein.
If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after several days, it does not harm; and if you wish, put something of dissolved aloe or myrrh on it, or some juice of mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
And indeed, many times pustules and swellings occur at the basilic vein phlebotomy.
Therefore, place your hand on it; if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is bad. Be careful not to put anything of what we mentioned on it. For perhaps blood from the artery will flow out from there.
But make a plaster for it with what has an astringent property, so that the place may harden. Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract blood from every man according to his strength. And it appears from the prevailing color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, then allow it to flow until it turns red; and similarly if you see that it is thick, then let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary that he who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once a year should have an ample bloodletting of the vein, and the phlebotomy should be broad; and in him who is weak, it should be the opposite.
And it is necessary that he should be bled at intervals, and the opening should be narrow; and better than what is done in bloodletting by venesection is a transverse cut, not a prick.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and from cutting the nerve, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
And if one is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that before the bloodletting they eat a moderate amount of bread soaked in pomegranate juice or wine if it is heated; and extract from them blood in three or four times.
And if they have a cold constitution, then before bloodletting let them eat bread soaked in apple syrup or in honey syrup flavored with spices, or in fragrant scented syrup.
But if fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is much blood loss, then it is necessary that they drink meat water and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let them use aromatics with algalia, and anoint their chest with it; and use the other things we have mentioned in the division of the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
But whoever wants to extend their arm and release their blood a second time, if the bloodletting is for much evacuation and his strength is weak, he should release the blood gradually according to the amount of his strength over continuous days.
But whoever wants to extend their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do it after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
But whoever wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side to which it inclines, they should extend themselves on the second or third day.
In whose body the blood is already heated and sharpened, and causes fever to happen, it is necessary that blood come out of them in one go, and a large amount be drawn from them; and the opening be widened until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and place your hand on their pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting. Often it happens that the phlebotomist is unaware and falls into neglect.
And it is not appropriate when one wants to release the arm and let out blood a second time, after the vein's opening has already been closed, making the exit of blood difficult, to press strongly on it with force and quickly stretch out the arm. For that is very bad; indeed, leave it alone until it is bled again a second time.
Or remove the clotted blood from the vein's opening with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, and place some salt dissolved in water on it. And place on it some of the theriac called Alfaroc or Sagzena, and cover it with a gentle bandage until the blood comes out.
But if the vein has already formed an abscess, then leave it alone and do not cover it until the abscess is settled.
If the necessity compels one to let out blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize at that same place or in another arm in another vein.
The cord of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the Fusca and the Basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is such that the patient places his hand in warm water until it becomes hot like fire and the vein appears clearly.
Then tie a bandage around it with moderate tightness. Then phlebotomize transversely little by little, not broadly, nor longitudinally; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it a little above the wrist joint.
If the exit of blood is prevented, then place your hand in warm water again and let the blood run in the water until you achieve what you need.
If however you are in the days of summer, then you should avoid washing your hands frequently in hot water. And indeed the course of blood is most placed in hot water in the time of winter.
And phlebotomy from this vein is safest of all veins because there is no pulsating vein beneath it nor a nerve.
But the phlebotomy of the right hand’s salutary vein is beneficial for illnesses of the liver.
And the method of phlebotomy is to tightly bind the vein of the hand with a ligature or your hand after you insert it into hot water until the vein swells and becomes very noticeable. 》 Then prick it transversely. And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all.
And preserve so that you do not end your hand with the phlebotomy. For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, exposed from the flesh.
Then immerse the hand in hot water again and let the blood run into it. For if you do not immerse it in hot water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal quickly.
And likewise, you should do this with every branch tied off.
The benefit of this phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen; and likewise do so with its phlebotomy as you did previously equally.
The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the uterus, and retention of menses, and diseases of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient places his foot in warm water and makes a rubbing on it until the veins swell, and then binds above the ankle with a cord. And the place of the veins is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe, and many branches extend from it on the sole of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch or at the heel in its junction, for this is better and safer.
But if you phlebotomize it on the sole of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath it and extend over the sole of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy as if you want to cut it from the side, and let the phlebotomist be Nasil.
But if the flow of blood is prevented, then immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
But if the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat with a little phlebotomy above, for this place is safe and you need not fear harm from it when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.  />
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot likewise.
But the place of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the inner side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the inguinal region when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient enters the bath and hurries; and bind his leg from the inner side of the groin to above the heel with four fingers' width, with a thin long cord, for it does not appear otherwise.
Therefore, when it appears, then phlebotomize it in whatever way is possible for you, either by transverse incision or by longitudinal section, and the latter is better. The place of it is safer, and this thing is very hidden in many people.
The place of it is safer, and this thing is very hidden in many people. But if you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses, then perform phlebotomy on some part of it, which is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and turn towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and let as much blood run out as you can.
Then release the constriction and place the skin over the site of the phlebotomy, and bind the site. For it heals quickly.
¶ On Cupping and the Benefit of Its Use.
Cupping glasses are made from horn, metal, or glass.
And cupping is done in two ways. 》 One way is with scarification and bloodletting, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this type of cupping that is done without scarification is done in two ways. Either it is with fire, 》 》 Or it is without fire.
And the sites for cupping that are given with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places on the body. One is the cupping of the occiput, which is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and cupping of Alhagdahim, which are two sites on either side of the neck at the same time; and cupping under the jawbone below the mouth; and cupping of the two shoulders; and cupping above the tailbone; and cupping of the two elbows in the middle of both arms; and cupping of both legs; and cupping of both knees.
Cupping does not draw blood from the small, dispersed veins in the flesh, and therefore their potency is not diminished as it is with bloodletting. And it is not fitting to administer cupping either with fire or without fire for any illnesses that are caused by fullness until the entire body has been evacuated.
If necessity calls for cupping due to illness or habit, we administer it at the beginning of the month, at the end, and in the middle, and at whatever time it may be.
That is to say, because there are some people who, when their blood increases, require its extraction through cupping, find headache and vertigo in their head.
And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And among them are those who scratch the site of their cupping. And among them are those whose laughter is increased. And among them are those who taste blood in their mouth; or the tongue swells and they spit out blood. And among them are those whose sleep is increased. xspace And among them are those who see blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to these in their sleep.
Therefore, when we see any of these things and especially if it is on the third day of the month, we then order cupping to be done after two or three hours have passed from midday.
The benefit of cupping the neck is that it alleviates heaviness in the head and the discharge into the eyes. But it should be done only after the evacuation of the entire body.
And this cupping is used in place of cephalic venesection.
And it is not permitted for those of cold temperament or with a head cold to use it. It causes great harm to him.
And because of that it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor for those whose heads are afflicted with cold diseases.
But he who becomes accustomed to it continually has forgetfulness generated in him.
And because of that it is necessary for you to instruct the person cupping in bloodletting to briefly lower his hand with the cup towards below, fearing lest forgetfulness be generated.
Cupping or Alkehel is the place of dark bloodletting and basilica bloodletting, and because of that it benefits asthma, constriction of breath, rupture of the lung, coughing, and fullness.
And it is necessary that the cup of Alkehel be briefly applied, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.  /> Et oportet, ut sit ei purgatus intestinum.
Cupping however of alhagdahim benefits pains occurring in the head, and eye diseases, and hemiplegia, and perforation, and pain in the tooth roots: and it is the place for basilica bloodletting.
And it is necessary to instruct the person cupping in bloodletting not to press hard with the cup after scratching, lest he cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Cupping however under the chin benefits ulcers of the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar diseases which are in the mouth; and it stands in place of bloodletting at Ali Ehriq which is on both lips.
Cupping however with spoons benefits al-khafeefah, which occurs from congestion and heat.
Cupping however of the inner parts of the two buttocks benefits the supplement to bloodletting of the three veins, basilica and dark and cephalic; because it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh, and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And you should instruct the bloodletter not to proceed too much with the incision, because the place is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
And the cupping glass that is applied to the anus benefits hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
And you should instruct the bloodletter to use a large cupping glass and one made of metal, because the place requires strong suction; perhaps delicate ones break, and it should be incised with a large cut.
But cupping glasses on the legs diminish greatly, because they draw blood from the whole body; and they benefit old pains in the kidneys, womb, bladder; they provoke menstruation, and benefit boils and amenorrhea; and they serve as a substitute for two saphenous bleedings and alchorbe.
However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to happen in many people.
And the benefit of cupping glasses on the Alchorbe is close to the benefit of two leg cups.
The quality of the position of the cupping glasses is that you should place the cupping glass in the beginning empty and draw with moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors may come to the place with equal arrival; and do not cease from repeating and continuing this until you see the place already reddening and swelling, and the redness of blood appears; then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider in the disposition of bodies.
For someone who has tender flesh and few pores, you should scarify him only once, not more, so that the place does not become ulcerated.
And instruct the bloodletter to enlarge the incision and make it a little deep; and let him regulate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
If there is a growth in the blood, then it is necessary that you incise him twice. The first incision opens the way for the blood to be made subtle and watery, while the second incision is used for a precise examination of the extraction of thick blood.
If however the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made so that it reaches its end.
And finally, when we want to extract blood gradually or briefly, one incision is sufficient for us. If we want to extract much blood, we should use multiple incisions.
And if we judge that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to incise with a deep incision, and the end of the incision should be equal to the depth of the skin.
¶ What is that which must be administered from the oils at the site of incision, and what should the person being bled avoid?
In the case of one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the sites of incision be anointed with open, soothing, softening oils: if this is in the summertime, such as alkali oil, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seeds.
And if this is in the wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or safflower oil, and others similar to these.
But if the excess is thick and cold, then let the oil be bitter orange oil, or oil of balm, or oil of aloe, or oil of dill, and others similar to these.
If the person to be bled has large pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary that they be kept from oil, and it is necessary that these people rinse the sites of incision with rose water, or cold water, or solarium water, or pumpkin water, or purslane water, and others similar to these. /> ¶
He whose blood is very moist should cleanse his wounds with vinegar or water of myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
As for him whose discharges are thick, he should cleanse his wounds with old wine or water of sumac, or decoction of anise or chamomile, and similar things.
And it is necessary that cleaning should be avoided in the bath or after leaving the bath; rather, it should be administered one hour or two hours after leaving the bath.
And it is not permissible for someone to sleep after cleaning.
What should be used to fumigate or bloodlet before cleansing?
And after that you should consider first whether the patient who has been fumigated or bloodlet is choleric and if sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood; then he should receive cooling things, such as pomegranate seeds, and also endive with vinegar, lettuce, sowthistle, and mallow, and similar things.
And his food should be simple, and the meat of mutton or fowl, and seasoned foods with sour condiments, and similar things.
And if his constitution is cold, he should take in drink syrup of honey or sweet wine, and althaea made from seeds; and let him take medium-aged fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and it is particularly recommended that he use a small amount of food. And let his food be simple and let him eat quail or turtledoves; and small birds like sparrows; and young pigeons.
And on the day of cleansing and bloodletting, drink should be more than food; and it is necessary to give in drink to certain people, in some hours, theriac alfaroch or a medicine made from musk, that is, mastic or aloeswood, before cleansing: and before or after bloodletting: so that the main members may be strengthened, and the blood refined. And it is not necessary for them to take it in a heated drink.
Of cupping without scarification. Now cupping without scarification are the cuppings placed on the liver, and spleen, and gout, and on the belly, and navel, and kidney region, and the bladder: because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And through them is sought nothing except drawing of blood from one member to another, as we place the cupping on the breasts during the illness of nosebleed. And we use them so that we may dissolve from the member the cold and unseen windiness in the member, as we place the cupping on the belly and navel. For it makes the member porous and warms it, and removes pain on account of this, because it dissolves that windiness.
Also it is placed on the kidneys when there occurs in them a stone or bladder stone. By the power of its drawing indeed perhaps it opens up the stone or roots out the stone from its place.
And similarly it does when placed on the liver and spleen for dissolving windiness in both.
And these cuppings are administered empty with only a cut. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water during pleurisy illnesses: and this is done so that the cupping be filled and large with only hot water or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping administered with fire.
Let the width of its opening be two fingers' breadth, as we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be on its side in the place which is about the middle of it a small hole, according to the size that can enter into it a needle: let it be made at once from brass or copper, thick-rimmed, smooth, even, polished so that it does not harm the member upon its position over it: and let there be in its midst a transverse rod of brass or iron where the candle with fire is placed.
And now this wound becomes large and swollen, larger than the one we have described, and only slightly smaller than that, according to the illnesses and age of the person using it.
For indeed, the ventoses for boys and thin people are different from those for men and those with thicker bodies.
The manner of applying this ventose with fire on the limb is as follows: Light a wick made from linen or a small candle made from wax, and place it on the middle of the crosspiece that is in the center of the ventose, so that the fire burns around the lower part of the ventose, to prevent the patient's body from being burned.
Then place it on the limb, and let your finger be on the opening that I mentioned, until when we hold the ventose; while we need to, remove the finger, and the vapor will come out of that opening, and the ventose will immediately release.
Then light the wick as needed, and repeat the process if you require it again.
However, in the ventose used in the illness of pleuresis with water, there is no crosspiece nor opening; and it is only applied after being filled with water and placed on the limb.
And this is its form.
And the larger this ventose is, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
¶ About the Suspension of Bloodletters.
Bloodletters are not used on many [parts of the body], except for those limbs where the application of ventoses is impossible due to their smallness, such as the lip and gum, and similar parts. Or on limbs that are bare of flesh, like the fingers, nose, and similar parts.
And the quality of using them is: that you come from bloodletters which are in sweet and clean waters, free from decay. ›
Then they are released day and night into fresh water until they are hungry, and there is nothing left in their stomachs. Then the body should be first evacuated with phlebotomy and with enema. Then cleanse the member of the patient until it reddens. Then they are placed upon it.
When they are filled and fall off, and if it is possible to suck the place with an enema, then it is more useful; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then with much water, let it be washed and squeezed out.
If the flow of blood continues after the fall of leeches, and if this is due to perspiration, then pour a flax cloth into cold water and place it on top until the sweating stops.
If the blood increases, then sprinkle on it powdered alum or oak galls and similar astringents until the bleeding stops.
Or place half-peeled beans on the spot and let them stay until they stick to the spot, for the blood will stop.  \\
And if it is necessary to repeat the use of leeches, when possible, change them.
But if leeches are prevented from biting, then cleanse the spot with fresh blood. Or prick with a needle until some blood comes out. Then place them on, for they will stick immediately when they sense something from the blood.
When you want them to fall off, sprinkle some powdered aloe or salt or ash on them, and they will immediately fall off.
This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it concerns the restoration of bone fractures and dislocations.
Know, O Sons, that fools and the common people boast about this chapter, even though they have never looked into an ancient book nor read a single letter from it.
And for this reason, this method has been privately concealed among the sciences in our land. And I have never found anything good in it at all, and I would not have attained what I have attained except through the lengthy study of ancient books and diligence in understanding them, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Then I devoted my life to experiments and long study.
And now I have described to you in this chapter all that my science contains: and concerning the experiment which I passed over after I shortened it for you, and released it from prolongation, and shortened it with the end of shortening, and showed it with the end of variation: and I formed many forms from the forms of instruments used in it, when they are added to variation, as I did in the two preceding chapters. ︎
Chapter 2
In the prologue of this chapter, it is fitting to summarize the key points and topics that are necessary for understanding them first: so that you, and those who are quick to learn, may know or learn this noble art, and teach others from you.
I say, therefore, that when someone has a fracture, dislocation, twist, or fall, you should hasten first to bleed them and loosen them, or both together, unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength: or the one who experienced something of these things is a child, or an old man withered by age: or it is a time of very hot weather, or very cold. ︎
Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and birds or goat meat; and avoid wine, heavy meats, and overeating of all foods that fill the veins with blood. Until you are sure of the healing of the warm swelling, and you do not fear the outpouring of matter to the member; then let the sick man return to his first regime with which he was accustomed.
When the fracture of the mouth begins to heal, then it is necessary for the sick person to be fed with nourishing foods that are abundant in nutrients and thick; such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, rice, fish heads, fish tails, cow intestines, eggs, fresh fish, and heavy wine, and similar things. With this diet, the healing of the fracture is faster and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first stage of old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be joined and healed according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their members; and they heal and join together those which are in the end of softness, just like the bones of little children.
However, nature attaches to the broken bone from every side something similar to glue, which has thickness, by which it adheres and binds together until they are joined together and bound together until it reaches the end of strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing prevents it from performing its functions; and because of this cause, it is necessary to provide for the sick person foods in which there is heaviness, thickness, and abundance, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the members; for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all other members are diverse from one another. And I have come with the recall of every type of fracture described in its own chapter, distinguished from others. And the types of bone fractures are also diverse among themselves.
Since a fracture can be curved, besides which splinters may occur in it. And sometimes the fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and these fractures are fragmented, that is, splinters, and protruding pieces, like those in a reed when it is trimmed with a knife for writing. And they do not protrude: and there is a fracture accompanied by a wound and tearing at the end: and there is a small fissure fracture.
And every type has its own skill or tool for its repair, as will be mentioned later, arranged by topic.
And from that which is recognized as a bone fracture is its twist and prominence, and its appearance to the touch, and its sound when you press it with your hand.  />
When there is no apparent twist or sound to the touch when you move the bone, and the patient does not feel great pain, then it is not a fracture. Rather, it may be a twist or a small fissure. Therefore, do not disturb it with your hand or pressure. Instead, place on it some of the medicines whose use will be mentioned after, when the time is right for that: then bind it tightly with fine bandages.
And know that when a place is curved and split into two, besides which splinters occur in it, however, every part is removed from its pair: then you should begin to straighten it immediately, evening it out before an inflammation occurs.
But if an inflammation occurs in it, then leave it for some days until the inflammation subsides.  />  /> Then straighten it according to whatever method is possible with gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration and equalization are easier than that of bone, where fractures occur.
Then tie it according to how you remember it.
But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two sides, whether it be hand or foot; either with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb on an equal spot, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended; then strive with all your skill and in whatever manner you can to return those additions to their places: and beware lest by your operation any pain or injury occur to the weak spot. And strive with all your skill that you join one of the two bones with its mate, according to the best forms.
And it is necessary at that time that you feel and touch it with your hand. Therefore, if you see something different there, correct it and make it equal according to the extent of your skill.
And beware of making a violent extension or a strong compression, as many foolish ones do.  /> For often they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb through their operation; as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Then bind it after equalization and proper operation, stricture, rest, and tranquility; and admonish the patient about this. And instruct him to be careful not to move it during his vigils or sleep, and during his turning, moving about, and all his movements with all his might.  />  /> And so that he may avoid the position of the limb which causes pain to follow. "When he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb, then it is necessary to change its position to one that causes no pain.
"And be careful with him so that his position is equal and straight, so that the limb does not become twisted when it is restored.
"And the condition of a broken limb's constriction is as I describe.
"Know that broken limbs are varied by their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
"Therefore, those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and thigh, then it is necessary for there to be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth. "But those that are thick, such as the thigh and leg, there should be a broad, hard wrapping.
"Because the wide bandage binds the large limb and constrains it from all sides equally with even tightness, so that no blemish enters it.
"Then begin after your evacuation from the equal position to place on top of the broken area an appropriate ointment on soft tow. "Then begin to wrap the bandage over the broken area with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves, and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
"Then go with it to the upper part from the broken place, and tighten less than you tightened the broken place. "Then extend yourself with the wrapping from the broken place slightly, and gradually ease the tightness until you reach a large healthy part.
"Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with wraps. "After that, go with the wrapping to the lower part from the break. "And let your work be in the tightening of the wrapping and its easing, according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Then place between the layers of soft tow or cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is made even, if there is any twisting in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Then wrap another layer over it. Afterwards, place on these layers evenly made and well-shaped splints immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in the place.
But if there is swelling or abscess in it, then place on it something that will relieve the abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days. Then tie the splints over it.
And let the splints be made from half-round canes, planed and wisely shaped; or they may be made of wood used for sieves, which are made from pine or geraid, that is, branches of the palm tree, or calingi: and let the width of each splint be according to this form and figure.
However, it is necessary that the splint placed on the tracture be somewhat thicker and wider than the other splints; and the length of the splint should be according to what is allowed by the member in terms of size and narrowness.
Then tie another bandage over the splints, similarly to the first binding. Then tie it securely with threads, as we have said about the binding; and know that your binding over the site of the fracture should be more, and the farther it extends from the fracture, the less the binding.
And know that the threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and they should be of soft linen.
For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of foolish people who use their threads made from twisted flax cords, it is a great mistake; for the binding slips with them outside of the proper quality.
And fine threads are not suitable again because you will not achieve through them what you want due to narrowing.
And it should not be less than a finger's width between the stitches.
If the patient is injured by the tips of the stitches after constriction in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow or carded wool until he is no longer harmed by it.
When there is a fracture with a wound and disruption of the skin occurs, I will excuse myself from mentioning it again by its singularity in the second chapter.
And know that not every broken bone should be tied with stitches on the first day. Which means that if the bone is large, you should not place stitches on it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the occurrence of a hot swelling.
And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients used to restore, and which are placed on a fracture or dislocation.
The method of a common shortened plaster for restoring a fracture, suitable for most constitutions, especially women and children, because it is made from something that neither heat nor cold can overcome.
And it is, that you take from the mill's dust, which is the marrow of flour hanging on the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone: and make it as it is, except that you sift it with the thin skin of an egg; and put its preparation not thick, nor fine. Then use it.
Another method of plaster for restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twist. Take almess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and the juice of all, ana ʒ X; of myrrh, ana ʒ V; and of both aloes, ana ʒ V; and alethil, ʒ XX. Let everything be ground and sifted, and mixed with alethil water, or with the thin skin of an egg, if the patient's constitution is hot. › Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones, and it benefits many people.
Another method for making a plaster that is also beneficial for fractures and dislocations: Take equal parts of mugwort, marshmallow, and white hellebore, each one ounce; also take myrrh and both kinds of aloe, each half an ounce; and Armenian bole, two ounces. Grind all these ingredients very finely, sift them, and make them into a paste with water or the whites of eggs, then administer it.
A method for making a plaster to reattach separated joints and bones to their proper places, and to soothe the pain that occurs in them, as well as bone fissures and fractures: Take clean wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and apply it to the place.
And indeed this plaster does not have the power of restoration, but it is good for soothing hot inflammation and properly drives away pain. ︎
A method for making a plaster that restores broken bone: Take the leaves of the common fig and the leaves of wild poppy, grind them all together, and make a plaster from both.
A method for making an abbreviated plaster, to be used in the restoration of a bone fracture and when you wish to resolve any remaining inflammation. Take equal parts of the root of white hellebore, camomile, violet flowers, and barley flour. Grind all these together and make them into a paste with wine, unless the limb is hot.
If it is hot, then make it with water of moist coriander or with water and use it.
Another method for a stronger plaster for resolving inflammation than the first one, to be used when a hard inflammation occurs during the restoration of a limb: ︎ Recipe of althea root, flax seed, balm, mallow, sumac, violet flower, and chamomile, all in equal parts; grind everything and make it with willow water or sweet water or wine. All of this according to the warmth of the limb and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates however did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb at the time of its restoration except for plaster made from wax and oil; nothing else; and he related that it is a medium between coarseness and fineness.
However, Galen believed that substances which have a drying effect on heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, along with similar substances from those we mentioned, should be placed on a fractured limb at the time of its restoration.
¶ Method of plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain. Recipe mugwort, chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt in equal parts; grind, sift, and make it into a plaster.
The quantity by which it should remain bound and then be dissolved is to observe at that time if no pain occurs in the patient, nor itching, nor does the broken bone move from its place; then you should not dissolve it for many days. If it happens that a severe itch or disturbing pain or swelling occurs in that place, then hurry and dissolve it in the same hour; remove the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge moistened with water; submerge it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain is relieved.
If it happens that a severe itch or disturbing pain or swelling occurs in that place, then hurry and dissolve it in the same hour; remove the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge moistened with water; submerge it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain is relieved. Then allow the member to rest for one hour. Then place on it a piece of cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose-scented oil; and bind it on for one night, until you are sure that the hot abscess has been relieved, and the swelling of the member has subsided, and its pain is removed.
Then apply to it a fine bandage and a small poultice; but do not bind it too tightly with your first bandage, and make the bandages that follow with it, until it is healed.
But if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all symptoms have been completely removed, and you no longer need a poultice and bandage, then bind it as you did at first, evenly.
But if nothing happens to the member from those things which I have mentioned, then do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days. And when it is unbound after twenty days, according as you see from the release of the member, as we have said, until such time as the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh comes together upon it: add also at that time more to your bandage than your first whole bandage; and add also in the thickening of weak food, according as you remember before.
But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out and becoming thin beyond what is fitting: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it. Soak it therefore with warm water at every time when you unbind it, and let this be for all three days, and relieve the bandage a little.
By this procedure nourishment comes to the member, and it is healed quickly.
But what foolish repairers do to a member when it is not first properly repaired after a fracture, and they repair it according to crookedness, that is an error from their procedure, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have said this in their books, and would have done so with it.
And I did not see their trace anywhere in that at all, and it is better if it is not done.
On the making of an injury to the head.
There are various kinds of fractures and many shapes; their causes are also distinct.
For there is a fracture caused by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone entirely to where it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and on account of this, this type of fracture is called 'axial'.
Or the sword cuts into part of a bone and cuts its surface but does not penetrate all the way through; and this type of fracture is called 'kalaan', that is, 'complete incision'.
And there are two types of wounds of fractures: large or small. ¶
And among the fractures is 'crushing' or 'grinding', and its cause is a blow with a stone or falling onto a stone or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating and approaching the marrow which is under the bone, or it is on the surface of a bone; and there are two types of wounds of these fractures: small or large.
And among the fractures is one which is hidden within a bone, like a hair's breadth, and it is a small crack; and on account of this it is called 'capillary'. ¶ ‌
And among them is the fracture which occurs from a fall or blow with a stone and similar things, which cause a layer of bone to split towards the inside, creating a depression, as happens in bronze cauldrons when they are struck, and part of them splits towards the inside.
And this occurs most frequently in the heads of moist bones, such as those of children.
And for all these types of fractures, splints are separated, and I will come with a reminder of the whole in its place.
And we know all these types of fractures by examination upon them, and investigation with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
But the species of the capillary is recognized by this, that it is exposed above the skin, and cleaned, and covered with wax: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms something that indicates a clear danger, such as vomiting of bile, distention, loss of intellect, hoarseness, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, their redness, and similar symptoms in various conditions, it is certainly not cured: and if you see non-threatening symptoms and hope for recovery, then begin its treatment.
That is, if a wounded person comes to you at the time of wounding: and it happens in the winter days, then you must strive for the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane corrupts, and those symptoms we have mentioned occur.
But if the fracture of bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with fragments, and drawing inward: then you must cut away the broken and drawn part, as I tell you.
And it is that you shave the head of the wounded person: and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you: according to the shape of the wound, and what is easiest on the patient.
If during the extraction of a bone there is bleeding or a hot abscess, then apply that which is necessary. And it is that you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be secure from bleeding. Then begin with the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And this is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a trephine of sharp edge, and this is its form.
Then administer another trephine after the first, wider than it by a little; and this is its form.
Then administer also another trephine, even wider than the second one.
And the second method is that you should have with you a number of different trephines, some of which are wider than others and some shorter; and they should be sharp at the end of their extremities, and made of Indian iron or steel; and use facility in striking over the trephine, so that it does not shake the head and injure it.  />
But if the bone happens to be hard and strong, then it is necessary that you should bore around it before you administer the trephines with boring instruments called non-penetrating borers; and they are not so named except because they themselves do not penetrate the end of the bony substance to what is behind it; for this reason, since the end of the borer is rounded over that which is under its sharp point, like a border and small circle, it prevents sinking in and penetrating the thickness of the bone.  /> />
And it is fitting for you to take from these borers a great many, each of which fits the thickness of the bone, until you have with you a borer for every skull; and the length and shortness of the sharp end of its tip should be according to the thickness of that particular skull.
And this is the form of three types of Terebrae, or Trepanes.
The quality of penetrating around the broken bone is this: you place the Terebra on the bone and roll it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated. Then change the Terebra to another place and put between every hole a quantity of thickness of the radius or about that amount.
Then cut with the Incisors what is between every hole from the bone and make that thinner than you can over that to the point of fineness, as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with some other of those instruments which you have prepared for it, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
And it is necessary that you take care with all caution that the Terebra or Incisors touch nothing of the brain.
Therefore when you go around the bone by penetrating and have separated it from the brain if it was continuous with it, and after you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and even out the end of what remains in the bone with another similar instrument like the Incisors. However, it ought to be thin and fine more than other Incisors.
If something remains from the small bones and splinters then take those easily with that which you have among your instruments. Then cure the wound afterwards with compresses and ointments as we said.
And another method of operating is very easy and far from fear, which Galen said and praised it greatly, and this is his statement. It is necessary for you first to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and manifest until when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the end of this lenticular Incisors, which has this form.
And the lens-shaped part, the gentle one, does not cut anything: and its sharp part goes into two sides of it, along its length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part rests against the siphac, with its sharp end cutting into the bone.
Then strike over the Incisor with a small hammer from one side until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it is turned: and you will be confident from the cloth that no accident will happen to it which you fear completely.
And if the physician is not more foolish than other men and is less ignorant of it, and does not sleep, then if anything from the cloth remains attached to the bone in certain places, he would cut it off with the end of the lens-shaped incisor itself, and free it from there easily. It is freed from that without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not reach the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps which you have prepared in various sizes, so that you may administer the most suitable and straightest ones according to the nature of the operation, the fractured bone itself, and its shape. And it is necessary for you to administer with wider ones first than those rasps. Then use a finer one after that.
And it is necessary for you to administer with wider ones first than those rasps. Then use a finer one after that. And do not cease to do this continuously until you reach the point of using the finest and most delicate one of all.
But in each of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary to take care according to what leads to its correction.
And it is a thing that is not hidden from anyone who has any interest in this art, and we have written about it and demonstrated in cases of great fractures.
But if the skin flap is retained when you extract the bone: then it is necessary to take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another piece of cloth, either double or triple-folded, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth. And make sure to do this as lightly as possible so that it does not burden the patient.
Then apply a broad bandage over it and do not tighten it unless it holds the wound firmly; and leave it for one day or two days until you are certain that there is no hot swelling. Then loosen it and apply after that medicines with which there is a dry excess, such as the root of lily, powdered herb, frankincense dust, aristolochia, and similar things; and it should be made into a powder from these medicines to be sprinkled over the wound like dry things. 》
And generally apply every medicine that has the property of cleansing and not causing irritation. And be careful according to your skill that the wound in your treatment is clean; and there is no dirt from ointment or other impurities in it.
And be careful according to your skill that the wound in your treatment is clean; and there is no dirt from ointment or other impurities in it. Do not allow any pus to gather on it at all; for when pus gathers on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, and a great evil befalls the patient afterwards: and this happens especially in skull wounds, when the bone is cleared from them, particularly when its care is neglected, with blackening on its surface.
Therefore, if such afflictions befall the patient, know that it is undoubtedly fatal.
And if the blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to produce that blackness; then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and anoint a cloth with them. Then place it upon the pillow; afterwards treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals.
¶ On the Restoration of the Nose When It Is Broken.
Know that only the two upper parts of the nose are broken simultaneously or one of them, because they are two bones; for the lower part is cartilage and cannot be broken, and nothing happens to it except for abrasion, twisting, and flattening.
If one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and equalize that fracture with your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and easily.  /> And take care that no pain occurs to the patient due to your action.
But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it; then it should be equalized with the tip of a small stick.
But if the fracture is in both parts, then do likewise; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day during the quiet stage of a hot swelling.
Then insert a linen wick into the tip of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two wicks if the fracture is in both parts; and let the thickness of the wick be such that it fills the nostril.  /> 
And some of the ancient surgeons said that ointments should be poured into butter and changed every day. However, this does not seem right to me; rather, the ointment should be poured into a bladder of an egg and mixed with ground pepper. Then leave the ointment until the bone hardens and the cartilage thickens.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of ointment, after wrapping the nose in a soft cloth: and this happens so that it holds the broken nose more firmly, and so that the sick person is not prevented from breathing.
And this is not necessary. If you want, do that; and if you want, make ointments.
But if a hot abscess occurs on the nose while you are working on it, make a plaster for the nose with caerot or cotyledon boiled in rose oil or a little of diacodion.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then you should make plasters for it with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with an egg bladder. Then place soft wool on top of it, and do not bind the nose at all.
But if the broken bones of a small nose fracture are shattered, then you should cut through them and remove them with appropriate instruments. Then, whether it is a cut or a wound, take care of it with what causes the flesh to grow and strengthens from suitable plasters or ointments for that.
But if a wound occurs between the nostrils, then you should take care of it with ointments and administer a lead tube until it heals. ➤
§ On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not with a wound, then see if it is only broken on the outside and is not split into two parts and curves toward the inside; then its diagnosis is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert with your left hand the index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and with it push the prominence of the fracture inward with ease from the inside with your other hand from the interior part of the bone neatly, and make it equal.
But if the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then you should administer traction from both parts, according to the straight line, until it is possible to make them equal.
But if the shock or disruption has already occurred to the teeth, then bind them with gold wire or silver wire, or silk thread from which you hope they will remain. Then place a splint on the broken jaw. Then place on it two layers of cloth, and on the cloth a large neatly made bandage; or an equal piece of sole skin in the length of the jaw.
Then bind it from above according to how its bandage is prepared and its application is suitable until it does not break; and advise the patient to rest and be quiet; and give him soft food.
But if you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then hurry and remove it on the third day. Then correct what has changed from it, and apply a plaster of mill dust with egg white or sesame flour, after you have removed the splint; and place soft wool on top of the plaster.
While that bandage remains on it and the bone's position does not change, leave it alone, lest you loosen it, until it heals; or bind up the fracture. For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
But if a hot abscess occurs meanwhile, then administer what we have often said for its reduction, until that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider [this]. For if already a fragment is separated from the bone, either by itself or through carelessness; then be skillful in this, so that you remove those fragments of splinters along with what suits you among the instruments for their removal.
But if the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to your need.
Then when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains of them, whether the wound's opening is then wide or not—if it is not, place on it one of the bandages that suit it, and allow it to heal until it heals.
¶ On restoring the collarbone when it breaks.
Indeed, the collarbone most often breaks from its anterior part towards the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
For it either breaks and separates into two parts, apart from the fact that splinters may occur in it; and this is easier to restore.
Or [it happens] such that splinters occur in the bone, and this is more difficult to restore.  /> Or [it breaks] with a fragment of bone remaining attached to it; and this is most difficult to restore.
Or so that [the break] occurs with a wound.
And the procedure in it when the break is without a wound is to have two assistants present: so that one of them holds support for the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards the affected side.  /> Then you place the fingers of your right hand under the broken end [of the collarbone], while with your left hand you push the healthy end upwards.  /> And you continue doing this until the broken ends join together perfectly.  /> Then you bind them tightly with a bandage, and leave it for fifteen days or so, not allowing anyone to touch it.
Then make the fracture even with your fingers until it takes on its proper form: and there should be no projection or depression.
If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's scrotum a pad of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your needs: and extend and raise the Furcula, and compress the pad with your hand, until you make the fracture even, as required.
If you cannot pull the end of the Furcula outward because it has gone too deep, then it is necessary that the patient be turned over onto his back: and place under his shoulder a medium-sized pad, and have your assistant press down on the shoulder until the bone of the Furcula which is deep comes up: and then correct the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
But if you feel a splinter from the Furcula that moves, then it is necessary to scrape over it and remove the splinter easily.
If however it is retained in the bone, then use an awl in its incision with one of the instruments that you have prepared for that purpose, after you have placed under the Furcula an instrument that preserves Sifach: and this instrument is made of wood or iron. And this is its shape.
It resembles a spoon without a bowl.
And its width should be according to your need for it, in proportion to the size and thickness of the bone. Its length also according to what is possible for you in working with it.
And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
If however the gap of the wound that you cut when you removed the bone splinter is wide and you are safe from inflammation, then bring together the two lips of the wound with a stitch.
And if the wound is small or you suspect a warm abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and fine wool according to the size of the wound.
If a warm abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the wound.
But a stricture of the bone without a wound or incision should be treated by placing on it an ointment made from flour and egg white. And place soft tow on top of it. Then place a weight under its heel if necessary.  /> Then take a bandage, that is, a roll as the Saracens use, which should be very long; its width should be one palm or about that. Then place a doubled piece of wool on top of the tow and ointment. Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width should be three fingers, and similarly in length. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap the cloth with the splint in the place of the bandage that falls over the break and the place. Then place the bandage over the break as it was rolled, and wrap it around its neck and under its sound heel and under its damaged heel; and bring it back over every part, so that the stricture holds the break well: and this should not be hidden from you, nor removed, lest the splint slip off the broken bone.  /> And therefore it is necessary that you examine the patient every day. Whenever the bandage softens and you see that the splint has already slipped off, then straighten it and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's back on his back, and place under his heel, by his bedside, a small pillow at night, so that with it his support is raised from his side. The fracture of the clavicle is healed by raising the arm.
Or tie the arm of that person to their own neck; and do not untie the bandage if it is not happening in the place of the injury due to itching or from a swelling, until twelve days have passed.
Then renew the plaster if you see the face turning towards it. And add tightness, and leave it until it is restored and solidified.
And indeed the fracture of the clavicle is strengthened and reinforced most in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens more quickly in certain individuals.
¶ On the healing of a scapula fracture.
The scapula is rarely broken, and only in its broad part; and from it nothing breaks except its edges.
When it is broken in that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and this is not known except by touch; then according to how the fracture appears prepare it.  /> And bring it back to its natural form in every way possible for you.
Then place on the site powder of flour with the white of an egg and soft flax, and put a little bit of doubled cloth over it. Then place on it a broad splint made of thin board according to the size of the entire scapula, or slightly larger than that.
If however there is a hollow beneath the splint in any place of the scapula, then fill that hollow with soft flax until the splint descends to an even level.  />  />  •
Then fasten over it with a long bandage, of decent tightness and firmness of the splint, so that it is not moved from its place.  />  •
And examine the bandage every day. Whenever the bandage becomes loose, tighten it and if the splint is moved from its place, even out the splint; and let the patient lie on their sound side.
And a spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Therefore, when this number is completed, then release the bandage, and you will be secure. For it [the bone] is of bones whose separation is not to be feared, nor their loosening.
But if it proceeds from a fragment of bone and pricks under the skin, then cut along with it and remove it. And do what we said about a fracture of the collarbone due to the subsidence of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ About the restoration of a rib fracture.
The chest is sometimes broken in its middle part, and this happens rarely. Its extremities are frequently broken and crushed by its accidents.
When its middle part is broken and bends towards the lower [part], and there is a severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps it vomits blood, and the concavity of the broken bone is noticeable to the senses, the restoration is that the patient should be made to lie on his back: and place a pillow between its blades. 》
Then press its shoulders and gather its ribs from both sides or the flanks with hands; and make them equal in thickness according to all possible ways that are appropriate until the shape of the bone returns as it should be. 》
Then place on it a plaster and wool, and place on top of them a splint made from thin wood such as willow or hazel, or similar light woods, after you have wrapped the [ribs] in cloth. Then make it even and tie it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and go with the bandage following its roundness to the back several times, and bind it tightly with a decent tightness. 》
Then consider the ligature at any time, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if its necessity calls for its loosening due to itching or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or an abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the poultice, and correct what happens with its method of treatment.
Then return the poultice if you see a pus-like substance; and attach to it a ligature until it heals.
About the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that the breaking of ribs does not occur except in thick places which follow the back, and from their ends on the front part. And they do not break except because they are made of cartilage. And the recognition of it is not hidden from the sense by examination with the fingers.
And its restoration is done thus: that you make the broken part even with your fingers as much as possible, until it matches the shape, as is necessary. Then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a splint if it needs it. 》
And if the break of the ribs is inclined towards the inside: then a severe pain and stabbing occurs, just like that which happens to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pricks the membrane. And also difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood occurs; and this is difficult to cure.
And the ancients have already devised many ingenious methods for it; and among them are those who say that you should give to the sick person foods that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the stomach is inflamed and swollen and the break is pushed outwards. 》
But we absolutely reject doing this, lest a hot abscess be formed quickly if it is not already present. If however it has already happened, then he adds it in that (case).
And some of them said: let there be placed over the wound a bellows, then let it be sucked out with strength, and this is more similar to reasoning. Nevertheless, one should fear that the bellows will attract superfluities to the place, due to the weakness of the body's condition.
And some of them said: the wound should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil; and between the ribs there should be placed small pieces (of cloth) until it is filled, so that when it is wrapped around it will make an equal bandage according to its roundness.
Then the patient should be treated with a pleural cure made from food and medicine.
But if something violent happens to the patient, which he cannot bear, and his face is pricked with a piercing pain, and we fear for the patient's life; then it is necessary to cut open the place and expose the broken rib. Then we shall place over it the instrument that preserves the siphon, of which the description has been given previously; and we shall cut the bone with ease, and cut through it.
Then we shall join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch; and we shall treat it with plasters until it heals.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then hasten and pour small pieces into rose oil, and place them over the site; and the patient should be treated with what is suitable for an abscess.
Meanwhile, he should also lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he recovers.
¶ On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
For the bones of the neck, a fracture sometimes occurs, and rarely an abrasion; similarly also for the vertebrae of the back. When this happens to someone and you want to know whether it will heal or not heal, then observe. For if you see that the person’s hands are already softened, numbed, and lifeless, and they cannot move them or extend them or clench them; and when you try to clench their fingers with your own and prick them with a needle, they do not feel it and experience no pain: then know that the condition is incurable and is often fatal.
But if they can move their hands and feel the clenching with your fingers and the pricking with a needle: then know that the neck of the bone is intact, and that the patient will heal with proper care.
But if the same thing happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not: then observe the person’s feet. For if they are softened and experience what was described for the hands; and when lying on their back, there is a release of wind and waste without control; and when turned onto their stomach, there is a release of waste without control; and when lying on their back and wish to urinate but cannot: then know that it is fatal.  /> Do not bother with treating him.
But if none of these things happen to him, then the condition is less severe.
And the treatment for what happened is to try to reduce the hot swelling in this way: place crushed rose oil alone on the vertebra, or with fried egg yolks.
Apply this to the area several times a day until the hot swelling subsides; then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters on it and bind it firmly with a bandage. Advise the patient to rest and remain calm. He should not sleep on the part where he feels pain until it is healed.
If it happens at the site of a fractured bone or any detached part: then it is necessary to make an incision over the skin and remove that. Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches, if it is large. Then care for him with some ointment until he is healed.
But if the last bone of the tail is broken: then it is necessary to introduce your left thumb into the anus and align the broken bone with your other hand as best you can, and re-align after the first alignment.
Then place him on his side and remove it; and care for the wound with the preceding treatment until he is healed.
¶ On the restoration of the anus.
Chapter 11.
The bones of the anus are rarely broken.  /> If they are broken, then the break is not complete but a splintering at their extremities; and they split lengthwise and turn towards the inside; and pain occurs in that place with tenderness, and the leg that is broken becomes numb.
And its restoration is to place your hand over it until you are standing above the break as its shape shows.
If the break is only at its extremities, then align it as you prepare from the alignment until it conforms to its natural shape.  /> 
But if the break is lengthwise or has already turned towards the inside, then have the patient lie on his stomach until you are ready to restore that break. So when you have aligned it, place a plaster over it; then place over it a splint of wood or leather and bind it with a bandage that will not cause displacement of the break nor movement of the splint.
And make the cavity of those equal with that which fills it, until the stricture takes it equally; and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs: then cease from extending it and its restoration until the hot abscess settles; and place upon it what settles it, as was said before, then return to restoring it; and tighten it as necessary.
But if it occurs in a bony protuberance or is fractured, extract it.
¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the thumb.
The thumb is that which is between the elbow and the end of the palm.
Therefore, if it breaks, its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you take a flat wood of medium thickness, according to this shape which follows.
And two bands are bound at the two ends.
Then it is suspended from a high place; and the patient sits on a seat.  ?> Then he lets his broken arm fall onto the wood until it reaches its tip, where in the middle of which is attached a curvature of the wood.
Then place something heavy on top of it so that the assistant extends it downwards. Then the physician sets the fracture with his hands at the same time until the fracture returns as necessary.
And the other method is that the patient lies on their back; and hang his hand from his own neck with a band. Then instruct two assistants to hold one of them what is above the fracture with his hands; and that the other holds below it, and each extends towards his own side.
And if you wish for a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with one band and above it with another; and each of the two assistants extends towards his own side.
If therefore the fracture is near the end of the humerus, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a ligament be placed over that spot and over the elbow itself.
Then equalize the fracture with ease and without effort until when the fracture is aligned as it should be and a good application is made: then tighten it, unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the bandage until the seventh day. And place on it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess quiets down: then tighten it: and the way to tighten it is to place a poultice over the fracture.
Then wrap a new cloth bandage over the poultice. Then raise the arm to the support, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
And wrap and bind the arm to the support so that the arm stands in place of a crutch: unless something prevents you or anything changes due to the broken bone.
But if you fear that something may change due to the broken bone, then use crutches: and it is that you should place a wider and stronger crutch over the fracture itself. And between each crutch, place a finger's width of space: and the length of the crutches should be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers from every side.  />
Then bind over the crutches the bandage I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.  />  />  />
And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture. And the more the fracture extends, the less should the bandage be.
If you see the position of the stars and the constriction, as we have said, immediately in the hour when you restore the limb, then do this: but if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the constriction and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the bond for three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place, or food is prevented from reaching the limb because of the disposition of the superfluity of constriction. Therefore correct all of that, as we have said.
But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bond until after three days, or more.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his belly; and place under his aid a cushion filled equally with wool.
And be mindful at every hour of the night or day, that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or the bond softened. Therefore correct all of this with your strength.
And give the patient's food according to the order that we have described previously, so that it is fine at first, until the mouth begins to dry out; then it is necessary to thicken his food.
For the custom of aid and leg is that it should be tight for forty days; then therefore it is necessary to loosen it, and administer a bath, and treat with ointments that correct this.
But if the break is ugly and ground down, then do not loosen from it the bond and stars until fifty days, and even two months.
¶ On the restoration of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearms.
Of these, one is smaller; and it is that which follows the thumb. ‌ And another is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Perhaps therefore only the larger forceps breaks, or perhaps the smaller one; and perhaps they both break at once.
Therefore when the small upper forceps breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the lower forceps breaks, its breakage is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse still when two bones are broken at once.
If therefore the bone that is broken is the small upper forceps, then it is fitting for the physician in its restoration to place a small extension with ease until he makes it even.
If however it is the large forceps that has been broken, then it is necessary to place a very strong extension.
And it is necessary for him to place the figure of the hand in its restoration, and its extension extended over the cushion. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint of the thumb be higher than all the digits or others; and let the patient sit squarely on himself, and let the cushion be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height so that the patient does not incur labor.  />
Then let the assistant stretch the arm from below with his hand or with a bandage. And let another assistant extend it similarly from above.
Then let the physician make the bone even until he brings it back to the best shape he can.
If there are splinters in the bone break, then strive to bring each fragment back to its place with your strength.  />  />  />
But if it appears to be a separate splinter that pricks the skin and there is no hope for its restoration, then shave over it and remove it according to the manner we have said before.
If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter for that, therefore take the treatment from there.
If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your healing, then take a cloth made from rose oil and white wax, with a consistency between thick and thin; bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage until the abscess subsides; then remove the wax, and apply an emplastrum prepared from millstone powder and egg white. Then place a compress, and let the compress that is placed directly over the break be somewhat wider and stronger.
And know that the number of compresses for the arm is six, arranged in various ways; whether the break is in one or two joints at once.
Then place your bandage over the break stronger and more vigorous, and somewhat tighter towards the upper part of the break or its lower part; or place a softer bandage for a short time, as has been mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the break be soft and moist; and not hard or rough. And let the thread with which it is bound be made of linen, medium between fine and thick, as we have said.
And examine the member and its ligaments after days. If anything happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the member; then it is necessary to bathe the member with warm water until that itching subsides, and leave the member unbound until it subsides; then renew the bandage.
If the bandage has already been softened, and the bone has been separated, and similar things; then strengthen that whole with your skill, and examine again.
For if food is prevented from reaching the member because of the excess tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat and leave it for some days until the food can reach it; then bind it again.
If however nothing happens to the patient from those things which we have mentioned, then it is not necessary that he be bled, except after twenty days or thereabouts.
Then let the hand of the patient be suspended around his neck. And let his neck be straight and guarded by its strength from violent movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days, or in thirty-two days, and perhaps it is healed in eighteen days. All of that depends on the temperaments of the body and the strength of the patient.
¶ On the Healing of Fractures of the Hand.
Know that a fracture of the bones of the hand and of the joints of the fingers rarely occurs. And it does not occur unless there is frequent friction.
Therefore, when a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the patient sit with his back straight, and before him let there be a seat according to its measurement. Then place his hand upon it extended.  /> Si autem accidit infirmo fractura digitorum, tunc oportet, ut ponatur infirmus supinus: et quiescent digiti sui in terra.
Then let the assistant stretch the broken bones, and let the physician straighten them until they are joined together by a good union.
Then it is necessary to place a plaster and wool if there does not occur a hot swelling. Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place, and you have now rolled it up in a linen cloth.
But if the fracture is near the bottom of the sole of the foot, then make something similar to a ball from cloth, and instruct the patient to press on it with his broken sole; then let it be bound with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather, which has softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the sole; and bind it as is necessary.
If, however, the fracture is on the outer side, then you should place a splint on top and another splint from below on the sole of the foot; and let the hand be held open and straight. Then put a bandage around it, as the hand is wrapped: and stretch it between the fingers with a ligament.
If a fracture happens to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, let it be set as is proper. Then let it be bound with a splint: and if you wish, put a small straight splint on it so that the fracture may be lifted up and not moved.
But if the fracture is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, and index finger, or ring finger, and little finger, then let it be set and bound with the healthy finger that follows it; or let them all be bound together according to their continuation: and this is better. Or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And take into account in your restoration and after the arrangement of the warm compress: and apply what is needed when something from it happens, according to its narrative.
¶ On the restoration of a hip fracture.
The hip bone is often broken and becomes apparent to the senses because it turns inward and backward.
And its restoration is done thus: that a bandage is tied above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture. › And let the patient be laid on his back. › ›
Then let every bandage be extended by the assistant to its respective place according to equality; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone. › › › ›
But if the fracture is near the base of the hip, then let the bandage be at the pubic bone so that the extension goes upward; and another bandage below the fracture.
And thus likewise if there is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee, so that it may extend to the lower parts.
Then the physician should adjust the bone with both his hands until he restores it to its natural form: and join the bone with a good union.
Then you must place a poultice and bandage, if an abscess has not occurred in the limb. But if an abscess occurs in it, then leave it for several days until the hot abscess settles; then return to your treatment.
And its bandage should be like this: You must wrap over the fracture a hard bandage, that is, a splint; and double it twice or three times, and let there be an excess of it. Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the base of the calf muscle.
And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee towards the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part on both sides. Then wrap over the leg and thigh what is in excess of the bandage.
Then place on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself a splint, and put one splint over the shinbone.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage may be even.
Then begin strongly with the bandage from the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four wraps. And as you extend more with the bandage from the site of the fracture, let your bandage be smaller and softer and gentler.
Then attend to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg. 》 Tie therefore with both three splints each which are above. Then go with the two ends of the thread towards the lower part until you reach the heel of the foot. And tie both ends of the strings to the other side: so that the ligature is not removed from its place.
Then leave the bandage on it until it heals, so that no decay, abscess, or swelling, and similar things occur in the limb. If anything happens from this. Therefore hasten with its removal, and correct whatever happened from it entirely, as we have said many times.
If however there is a splinter of bone that is piercing, then it is necessary to equalize it, if it is possible for you. And if not, place a bandage over it and remove it; and care for it as we mentioned before, until it heals.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is tied with strings, just as we said for the arm and hand.
However, in the healing of such a fractured one, lameness does not happen to the invalid. And if it is restored alone, without the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary for that one to always limp.
And know that the hip is tied for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less; all of this depends on the diversity of temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ On the healing of the fracture of the patella of the knee.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap happens rarely, but its abrasion occurs often.
If however it does happen to be fractured, then only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.  /> Et si est fracta Rotula, tunc debet medici cognoscere, utrum est fracta tota, aut fracta pars eius. And it is either with a wound or without a wound. And stand on it entirely with the sense of touch.
And its restoration is thus: that which was disrupted from its parts with fingers, until it is aggregated and joined together as much as possible by equality and simplicity, and construction.
Then place a plaster made of sesame flour or from a mill with egg white; and place on top of it a round piece of cloth if you need it; and bind over it an appropriate bandage for that.
Then consider all the arrangements we have mentioned for other fractures; such as a hot abscess and similar things; so that you oppose every incident with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ About the restoration of a thigh fracture.
Know that the thigh has two bones, one of which is large and is called by the name 'thigh bone', and the other is fine and is called 'tibia'.
And it happens to both types of fracture that it happens to the two bones of the arm; and because of this its restoration is done like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
If both bones break at the same time, the leg turns in all directions.
And if the finer bone breaks, the leg turns to the front.
And if the larger bone breaks, the leg becomes shorter; and it is one of those which do not conceal itself from you.
Then administer extension, equality, and bandaging of the cloths according to that equally.
However, it is necessary, if the thigh fracture is a foul fracture, having many splinters; that the extension be less and gentler with your alleviation.
And in the case of the thigh there is something more to do than for the arm; and that is, when you have made the cloths equal and completed all your work, then take two strips of wood from pine which are used in the construction of sunrooms placed under the boards: and they are made into palm-sized pieces; and choose those whose thickness is not too great nor are they among the smallest; and their length should be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.  />
Then wrap around each cloth twice along its length. And place one part of the leg on one side and the other part on the other side; and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Then bind two bandages in three places: at both ends and in the middle. For when constriction is prevented, the leg deviates to the right and left, and it stands firmly in place.
And now indeed let a cradle be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and place the leg in it so that it may preserve it from motion.
And indeed you must do this especially in a fracture when there is an associated wound.
Then examine the leg every day, and strive with all your might to prevent swelling or inflammation, or any other complications.  () If therefore any of these things happen, then treat it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills it.  ()
On the Fracture of the Bones of the Foot and Toes.
Indeed, the heel bone never breaks completely.
However, the bones of the foot sometimes break, and the toes hardly ever break; and this does not happen to them except by abrasion in many cases.  () ():
If the bones of the foot break and you see those bones separate from one another, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground as if he were walking.  () ():
Then stand on your own foot and place it over the one that is elevated from those bones; afterward press or step on it, and adjust it until it returns to its proper place.
Then apply a poultice and wool on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Then bind it with a proper ligature after you have wrapped it with bandages and other necessities.
After three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligature. For you will find that the bones are leveled, whether they were broken or dislocated. The operation is therefore on them, as you see.
But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and level them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint on the finger according to its length, and let it be slightly wider; then place this board that I have told you under the ligature, and bind it with a proper ligature.
But if two, or three, or more of the bones are broken, then place a splint on each finger according to its size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board below the ligature: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the ligature, so that it holds well.
And it is fitting for you not to forget to consider all that I have told you in the other fractures from the accidents that we mentioned; and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ On the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the pubic bone, and a man's penis.
When a woman’s vulva is broken, then make her sit on a stool. Then incline her slightly towards her back, and let her be held from behind.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let there be a sphere in the vulva from that.
Then let the woman be shaken, and gradually raise her back.  /> For that cotton comes out until there is a sphere before the opening of the vulva, and the broken part returns.
Then place a little down upon its back. When he wants to urinate, let him remove the probe easily, then urinate; and put it back as you first inserted it; then return to his little feather.
Let him do this for seven days, or thereabouts, until the wound heals.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a straw tube over its opening, then insert the whole bladder into his wound. Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inside the wound swells up, for the bone will return to its place.
Then fill it with a probe and let it remain for several days, as we have said, until it heals.
And when a man's or woman's breastbone is broken, then administer for its restoration and alignment that which we have mentioned concerning the shinbone.
And the rectum should not be hidden in these nearby fractures which hardly touch it, especially for someone who has some learning or experience. ›
And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself indicates to you the right way in many arrangements for its restoration and setting; so understand.
But if a man's penis is broken, take the throat of a goose and insert the penis into it. Then place a bandage of cloth over it and let it be wrapped up, and leave it alone for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it.
¶ Concerning the setting of bone fractures when there is also a wound. ›
It is appropriate for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip or thigh bone, to hurry and bleed him immediately: if you find the conditions for bleeding as we have mentioned previously.
If the wound is bleeding, you must hasten to cauterize it, so that you sprinkle ground zegi over it; if nothing else is available.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day; and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad things to happen to him.
But if the broken bone protrudes above the skin, then you must try to reduce it and make it even with your hands, with gentleness and a small amount of stretching.
But if its extension and making it even with your hands are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument. And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight finger-widths; and its width is according to the size of the wound. And because of this it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity needed for that treatment in every type of fracture.
And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not bend during the operation; and let its end be sharp, with an edge at its ends. And let its upper part be thick from half of it to the lower part.
And this is its form.
In this operation, the sharp end should be placed on the protruding bone; and it should be pushed with one thrust until the bone returns and is made even to some extent.
Therefore try to make the ends of the fracture even with each other.
But if the ends of the fracture are fine and the instrument does not take them well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.  \\
If you cannot reduce them by the method we have described, then cut him with a suitable instrument from those we mentioned, or saw him with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Then scrape off what remains on the bone from roughness and small shells.
Therefore, when the bone is reduced and the patient experiences severe pain after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Do this. For you grant great help to the patient when you complete the restoration that you perform on the bone.
Then dip the cloth in black astringent wine. And especially if it is summer. › And do not place a fatty substance or anything containing oil on the wound, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Then administer pills at the hour when you complete the bone's restoration. And leave the wound open: do this by cutting a hole with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound. ›
And be very careful not to bind the wound too tightly over the fracture. Many times indeed have foolish doctors done this and caused either death or gangrene or purulent matter, that is, pus, to occur in their patients. And let your bandage be soft and gentle, different from the binding of other fractures. › ›
If the wound is bad or large and you fear certain evil consequences that we have mentioned, and you find pain in the affected area, then it is not right to place pills on it. And make bandages of hard cloth where the pills would be and bind it with them.
But when it is after one day or two days and you see that the wound has begun to generate pus, then remove from above the cloth which you placed on it with wine. › › › › Then administer ointments and unguents with which we are accustomed to treating wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment, and similar ones.
And it is suitable for you to dissolve the bandage. And observe the wound every morning and evening until it heals and consolidates.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus flows down from it easily.
If many days pass and the wound does not heal nor does the pus separate from it, then know that there are small bone fragments there. Therefore, you should examine the wound with a probe. However many fragments are separated out, remove them and extract them.  /// And those that are not separated and cause pain in the limb, making it hurt, strive to cut them out and remove them by whatever means is possible for you.
If the wound becomes inflamed or develops a carbuncle (which is a stye) or another sign of corruption and putrefaction, then you should apply to each of these what is suitable from its treatment, whose description precedes in its chapter.
And concerning what I have said and to which you should pay attention: when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as a hipbone or thighbone or similar large bones, do not attempt to reduce it, for often death results from this. Instead, leave it alone until it becomes gangrenous.  /// ///
Perhaps indeed it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if it appears to you that you should, and if not, leave it alone.
¶ On the treatment of swelling at the site of a fracture.
This swelling often occurs as a result of treating a fracture. Especially when it is near the joints; and it causes deformity in the limb. And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply to it remedies that have astringent properties, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, sarcollege, acacia, and similar substances.
Take some or all of these and prepare them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar; and place them on the swelling over a pad, and bind it firmly with a good bandage.
And leave the bandage in place, without removing it for many days. Then remove it and apply another one, until the swelling is removed. ※
Or bind over it a sheet of lead neatly. ※ ※ For lead has the property of removing all that is feared in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already turned to stone and is bound tightly, and there is an urgent need to remove it quickly, then cut a hole in it from above and trim off the prominent excess; or shave it with some razors until it is removed, and care for it until it heals. ※ ※ ※ ※ ※
¶ On the treatment when a limb is restored but remains thin and not according to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this happens only for many reasons. One of these reasons is the frequent loosening and re-tying of the bandage not as required; or because of an excessively tight binding of the ligaments, so that nourishment cannot reach the limb; or because of excessive application of unguents at the wrong time; or because of a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and his weakness. ※
And the treatment is, to feed the patient and make his body soft, until blood increases in him. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Then place pitch on the member, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it. And frequently apply an embrocation to it with warm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ On the treatment of fractured bones when they heal crookedly.
When a member already restored after healing becomes twisted or lumpy and the fractured bone has a knot or deformity which disfigures the shape of the member, yet the member does not prevent its natural operation; then it is not necessary to receive the opinion that the member should be broken again.
And there have been many foolish physicians and surgeons who have done this in our land. ∙
And indeed this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as if it were deadly. ∙
But if the limping and knots are recent, then it is necessary that [the member] be embrocated with warm water in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as althaea leaves, its root, and melilot, and similar ones. ∙ ️ ️ And let there be made for it a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon.
Or let there be taken the mucilage of the root of althaea and mixed with chicken fat or sesame oil, and let it be plastered with it.
Or let there be taken fat figs and ground with pigeon dung and similar things from the class of drugs which are called diminishing consolidations.
And sometimes the knot is dissolved with frequent, gentle, old friction which is done with wet hands. ∙ And movement of the limb should be applied to every part at all hours.
If however the tortuosity has already advanced, and has become strong, and turned into stone, and there is a need to treat it with iron: then it is necessary that its upper part be cut, and the continuity of the bone be severed, and what is excessive from the knot or the bone be cut away with fine incisions; and ease should be applied to it with diligence and care.
About speech in dislocation.
Dislocation is the departure of some joint from its place. Why it is prevented from its movement and the figure of the limb is disfigured. And it causes severe pains and injuries to happen to the sick person.
Therefore, when someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to hasten towards its restoration; and do not delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed, and perhaps along with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Therefore, because of this, it should not be moved or extended during its hour of inflammation.  ?> Because often it causes spasms and painful pains to happen.
But when this happens, then it is necessary that you hasten towards bloodletting of the sick person. Then let it be released until the inflammation quiets down.
Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.  ?>  Et tunc oportet, ut sollicite resolvat medicus dislocationem. Then it should be reduced with ease.
And the entire limb should be scraped, along with the part that will come to its place.
I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, following what was mentioned previously about fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower part of it.
About the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw
The two jaws are rarely dislocated except on rare occasions.
And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways. For either they are removed from their place by a slight displacement and soften slightly. Or they are dislocated completely until they soften to the point of reaching the chest, until the saliva of the patient runs out, and he cannot hold it or close his mouth, and his tongue rolls with speech.
But when the dislocation is slight, then it returns to its place by itself in most cases.
But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to administer its reduction quickly and not delay at all: and it is for the assistant to hold the head of the patient: and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between his teeth, if the dislocation is on one side. ➤➤ Or he should insert both thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from both sides. And the other fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he will equalize [the pressure]. ➤➤
And order the patient to clean his jaws and return them to normal chewing in every respect. And the physician should equalize the jaw and push it until it returns to its place.
But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer steam with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Therefore, when they return and are equalized, and the patient's mouth is closed and does not soften: then place on them small wads of cloth with a plaster made from wax and rose oil. ➤➤
Then it is bound with ease using soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back; and let his head be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left; nor should he attempt, or be forced, to chew anything; rather, his food should be a gentle drink until the pains are removed, and the jaw is bandaged. Then he may eat what he wishes, and it should be administered with ease.
Let him not strain when eating, drinking, or swallowing, until the jaw is bandaged and healed.
But if the realignment of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their proper places, then frequent fevers and continuous sweating often occur; and perhaps the patient's stomach becomes upset, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Therefore, when you see this happening, know that it is fatal, and the patient often dies within ten days.
¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the end of the humerus.
The clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side because of its connection with the chest. And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside, and this can be perceived by touch.
The restoration of it is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then press upon the place strongly with your palm, for she will return. 》
Then place a poultice and pillows over it, and bind it.
However, the ends of it that follow the elbow and are continuous with it are rarely dislocated. But if it is dislocated on any day, then it should be reduced and set according to what we have said and prepared for you.
Then place a plaster, woolen cloths, and bandages on it. And tell the patient to keep calm and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment the end of the arm can be repositioned when it has also been displaced from its place.
¶ On the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Know that the humerus (upper arm bone) is not dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is when it dislocates towards the armpit downwards. The second is when it dislocates towards the chest. And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus, and this happens rarely. ⟩
And it does not dislocate backwards, because of the glenoid cavity. And it does not dislocate forwards, because of the nerves.
Indeed, it most often dislocates and exits downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is scanty. Because it exits quickly in them, and also re-enters quickly. ⟩ ⟩
But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of this, that is, because it exits with difficulty and also re-enters with difficulty. ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
And it happens to some people that a blow or fall occurs and the humerus swells with a hot swelling, and it is thought because of this that it has already been dislocated.
Therefore, you should test this until you are certain about it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And a dislocation is recognized when it is downwards towards the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one. ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ For you will find between them a clear difference, and in the head of the humerus there is a concavity, and under the armpit you can feel the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all directions. ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then the young person will have a clear sense of touch and it will not be hidden.
And the reduction of this particular dislocation is easy when it is recent or if the child is weak.
The reduction of it is such that the assistant lifts his hand upwards. Then place your thumbs under its little finger and raise the joint with strength upwards to its proper place, and the assistant lifts his hand and extends it upwards. Then he places it downward, for it returns quickly by itself.
However, if it does not return through that which we have said, and there are many days since the dislocation first occurred, then it is necessary for the patient to be bathed in warm water and an embrocation should be administered that softens and soothes, such as if althea root, fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water and administered.
Then the patient is placed on his back, and a ball and wool are put under his little finger, which should be equal between softness and tightness.  \\
Then the physician places his heel on the ball and lifts the head of the humerus with strength, drawing the patient's hand downwards.
And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is as if you make a man taller than the patient stand on his side, and he places his shoulder under the patient's little finger; and he raises the little finger upwards until the patient is suspended in air. And another assistant pulls the patient’s hand down towards his belly. But if the patient is lightweight, then it is necessary to suspend something else with him so that he becomes heavier, for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it can also be reduced by another method: and that is, to place a long stick in the ground, whose head is round like the top of a mortar, not too thick, nor too thin. Then let soft cloths be placed under the sick person after he has been laid on top of the head of the stick, and let the sick person stand along the length of the stick.
Then let his hand be extended to the lower part on one side, and let his body be stretched out from the other side with force, for the joint returns quickly to its place.
But if his reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this remedy: and that is, to take a stick whose length is the length of two arms, and its width the width of four fingers, and its thickness the thickness of two fingers; let it have a round head, so that its insertion into the deep part of the armpit can be facilitated according to this shape.
Then let soft cloths be tied over the round head, so that the stick does not hurt the sick person.
Then let it be placed under the sick person's armpit, so that the hand or arm may be extended over the stick down to the lower part; and let the stick be tied over the helper and the arm and the tip of the hand.
Then let the arm be placed across a step of the ladder by its width, and let the hand be extended downward, and let the rest of the body hang suspended on the other side. For the joint returns immediately.
Therefore, when its insertion is completed by any possible method, then it is necessary to place under the armpit a sphere of equal size made from wool. Then apply a plaster prepared from powdered flour of wheat with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is rolled on top.
Then bind a decent bandage under the armpit, and let the bandage be rolled over the plaster on top; and fasten his hand to his own neck, and let it not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the food of the sick person be little, until the part becomes stronger: for it hastens its healing.
Then let there be more [food] after seven or five days, and it should be purged with exercise. If then it becomes firm and not soft, it is already healed.
But if the dislocation is often repeated, either because of moisture that afflicts it or some other cause, then it is necessary to apply a caustic with three holes, as was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery.
But if all this is done and the ligament is released after seven days and the joint is not strengthened and the plaster and the bandage are repeatedly applied over it and it does not become firm and falls and cannot be lifted upwards, then know that the nerves leading to the head of the shoulder have already been cut or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
However, the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and the breast or backwards is reduced by pushing and stretching with the hands until it returns, and then the remaining bandage and care are applied to it until it heals.
But if after healing a heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its motion, then let the sick person use the bath frequently until that heaviness is relieved and returns to its original nature.
¶ On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty. And indeed it can be dislocated in all directions, especially towards the front or the back.
And its dislocation will not be hidden from you, for it is visible and tangible, whatever shape it may take when dislocated. › And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly indicated to you. For if the joint were correctly set in place, it would be possible for the arm to bend and to touch its shoulder with it.
And you should hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot inflammation occurs in it.
For if a hot inflammation occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back. For it is worse than all other types of dislocations and causes more intense pain in them; and often death accompanies it.
And its restoration, when it is among those that can be reduced, is as follows: the hand is extended with two hands; and the arm is spread out; and the physician's hands are above the elbow and below it; and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of his hands together or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.  />
Or if the dislocation is towards the front, then it returns in this manner: he folds the hand with his hand until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of his palm.
But if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer a very strong and powerful traction; and it is that two assistants extend the arm; and two assistants also hold him so that he does not move during the traction.
Then the arm is rolled in every direction after a doubled long cloth or wide bandage has been wound around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil, so that this helps in facilitating the slipperiness of the joint. Then he should push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
And after its reduction, an emplaster should be placed on it, in which there is astringency and dryness with the white of an egg; and it should be bound with a moderate bandage. And let the arm be hung from the neck of the sick person: and leave it for some days.
Then release it. If therefore the joint is fixed in its place, then release the ligature from it and leave it alone.
And if you see that the joint is not well bound, then repeat the bandage and ligature, and leave it alone for some days until it is firmly bound. Then release it.
But if after the reduction of the joint and its setting in motion heaviness occurs, then apply moistening with bathing, subtle friction, and compression until it is straightened, or place over the joint iliati, that is, fatty tallow of a ram. Then let it be bound, and leave it on the joint day and night. Then remove it, and place him in a bath. When he has sweated, then apply moderate friction to the joint. Then repeat on the same place iliati once, and a second time, and a third time upon entering the bath until it is eased.
And if you wish, place on the same cow dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind it over.
Do this several times. For it is thus eased, and returns to its own state.
¶ On the treatment of dislocation according to Al-Zahrawi.
The hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
And its reduction is easy. Unlike other joints. 》 Nevertheless, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour when it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen, or an inflamed swelling occurs there. 》
And the reduction of dislocation is such that you place the hand of the sick person on a board, and let an assistant extend his hand; and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns. 》 》
However, it should be considered whether the palm has already retreated to the abdomen; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a board for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inside on the board, that is, the interior part of his hand should be placed on the board so that the doctor's hand falls onto that same protuberance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, this is good; and if not, then bind it with a bandage to subdue the swelling, and leave it alone, do not agitate it.
For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot reduce it, even after the days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains according to its crookedness; and nothing harms the patient except that his hand becomes weakened and cannot grasp anything; then you should know that the nerves are cut or torn.
Therefore, there is no skill required for it, except to bind it with a cautery near the site of the injury. And perhaps this does not help at all.
Therefore, when Almahassem does not return, then place on it the plaster that we have described. Then it should be bound and left for five days; afterwards it should be loosened and left, and the hand should be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and something heavy happens to it, then soften it with warm water and frequent friction until it becomes softer.
¶ On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
When one of the fingers is dislocated in any direction, or if a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm or its abdomen; then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the direction in which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then hang him and extend him until he becomes straight on that day itself.
When it is night, bind him according to the same account: and do not cease to release him during the day; and exercise him with movement; and bind him at night.
Do this for several days until he becomes stiff.
And do the same if his hand is dislocated towards the abdomen; and bind him to that part, and perform your first operation on him until he is healed.
And do the same with him when he is dislocated in other parts.
§ On the treatment of spinal dislocation.
When someone experiences a complete dislocation of the spine or neck, or when many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick person quickly.
And the sign of this is that the sick person discharges without control and cannot hold it back; and often some of his limbs become flaccid, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them; or a single vertebra may be displaced from its position.
For often it is displaced, because often there is a displacement in four parts.
That which is displaced towards the back is called a hump.
But its treatment is that you should consider then, if the hump occurs from childhood; then there is no cure for it, nor any healing at all. />
But in the case of those that occur from an accident, or a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken about methods of treatment at length. In most cases, it does not return to good health.
But I have already shortened it from him, whose account is excused by my own experience with many of his cases; and in my exposition, which I presented on that topic, and formed an instrument for it in a different way than they demonstrated and explained it.
I say therefore that in a humpback which occurs from the front part, there is no skill nor healing from it.
And similarly in those [humps] that occur on both sides as well.
And it is not cured by these [methods], except for the one that occurs in the back properly, as I shall describe: and it should be done thus – the patient should be stretched out on his face upon a level platform near the wall; and under him should be placed a moist covering, so that his chest is not harmed.
Then a straight piece of wood should be fixed in the ground at the edge of the platform near his head; and another [piece of wood] at the opposite end near his feet. And an assistant should hold the [upper] piece of wood, and it should not be fixed in the hole. And another assistant should hold the other [lower piece of wood].
Then wrap a soft but sturdy bandage around the head of the patient and under his chin; and stretch out the end of the bandage to the piece of wood that is near his head, and tie it securely there.
Then tie another bandage above his ankles and above his knees and at the back of his thighs. Then gather together all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood near his feet.
Then let each assistant pull on the bandage toward the piece of wood, and do not remove the two pieces of wood from their places where they are fixed; but they should not be fixed [securely], as we said.
And the doctor should place his hands on the spindle with strength until he returns; or [he may] place a board over it. Then let him attach his feet to the board until he returns.
But if he does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three spans [arms]. And make an opening in the wall near the patient (as I previously said) into which the end of the board can be inserted. /> Then place the middle of the blade onto the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet on the other end. And he should pull firmly until the vertebra is dislocated and then return to its place.
Then if you wish, operate with a device that is wound with your hand: and it is as follows: fix two pieces of wood into the ground at the head of the patient, at the far end of the bed, each one arm's length long; and at his head, at the far end of the bed, fix two more pieces of wood.
And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place through which the device runs; and let each piece of wood be firmly secured in the ground so that it does not move at all.  />
And insert a round piece of wood; and this is the device on which the band is wound between the holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole in which the wood is secured, whose length is one palm including what is wound; and on the other two pieces of wood it is similar to this.
Then tighten the bands that you have tightened on the patient's chest with the device that is at his head; and the bands that you have tightened on his legs with the device that is at his feet.
Then let there be an assistant standing at each device, who will turn the handle with which the device is wound; and the physician shall straighten the vertebra as we have said.
This is the form of the device that follows.
Then after the vertebra has returned to its place and the area has been straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying plaster with egg white. Then add tow. Then place a splint of wood on top of the plaster, whose width is three fingers or about that. And its length should be such that it can contain the swelling, and extend above a healthy part of the jawbone.
Then let it be tied with the ligature we mentioned. And let the patient use a light diet until healed.
If something of the swelling remains at the end of healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines along with the tablet we mentioned, over a long period of time. And now lead is applied to that plate.
And sometimes a swelling occurs at the end of the spine in the back, and it is thought to be caused by a dislocation, and that bone which now protrudes. Therefore, one should not assume this with that medicine, for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Know that the ankle joint and the shoulder joint do not suffer from slight displacement or indentation like other joints do.
And the ankle joint can be dislocated in four ways. □ This is because it can be dislocated forward and backward.
And indeed it is most commonly dislocated inward, and rarely dislocated forward or backward. □ □ □
And the treatment for its inward dislocation is as follows: when you join the sound leg of the patient to his infirm one, it will be longer; and its knee will protrude more than that of a healthy person, and he cannot bend his foot at the groin; and the place following the groin will be swollen with a hot swelling, because the head of the thigh bone has already reached there.
And the sign of one who has suffered an outward dislocation is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of it [the dislocated bone] is that it extends the healthy leg according to its full length; however, it does not double it without pain in the knee; and if it tries to walk, it cannot step on it with the toes; and urine retention occurs, and the groin swells, and upon walking, there is a stepping on the heel.
And the sign of it [the dislocated bone] occurring to the back is that it does not extend the knee, nor can it double it before doubling the groin; and its leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and there is a prominence at the hip joint.
The reduction of this type of dislocation is, when you consider, if the dislocation is old and has already been present for a long time with the person having it. Then if you perform the reduction on it, and it remains in its position: then there is no treatment for it at all. Therefore, it is not right to make a complete attempt [to reduce it].
But in the case of someone whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four types of dislocations: then hasten to do this, so that you roll the joint and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it from right to left; for perhaps it will return, and will not require any other treatment. 》
But if it does not return this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and let him extend the leg from below; either with his hands or with a ligature that is tied over the leg above the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand on top, so that he puts his hands under the armpits. 》 Then let him tie it with a gentle ligature around the hip joint, and hold the end of the other ligature.
And let the extension be either from the front part of the groin to the clavicle, or from the back part to the spine.
And let their extension be performed simultaneously, until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
And this kind of extension is one of the four common kinds of extension.
If then the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every species to do that which I will say about the proper cure.
In the proper reduction of it, when the dislocation is to the interior, it is necessary that the patient be turned over onto his healthy side. Then he should place a bandage over the hip joint, between the head of the femur and the place that is under the groin. Then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the highest part of the body, to the collarbone area.
Then another strong helper should take hold of his arms and diminish the thick part of the dislocated hip, extending it outward with great force. › Now indeed it has returned to its place.
And this kind is the easiest of all the kinds of cure by which this limb is reduced.
But if it resists you and does not obey this cure at all, then it is necessary to bind the two feet of the patient together with a strong, soft bandage over the two heels and over the two knees; and let the length of each be four finger widths from its fellow part: and let the leg of the patient be extended more than one and a half times. ›
Then let the patient be suspended over the top of a beam that is in the house; and let its length from the ground be two arm lengths.
Then command a strong young man to support the head of the thigh; and let another young man be suspended with the patient; and let another young man push with strength, supporting the thigh, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In its own reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lies on a bench, as we have narrated concerning those with a hump. And let a ligament be placed above his leg, specifically upon the sick person, and above his chest.
Then two sticks are to be placed: one at his feet, and the other at his head. Then let a stick be added in the middle of the bench, fixed well; upon which moist cloths are to be wound, so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the stick be between his thighs, so that he is not pulled downward during the stretching.
Then every assistant should stretch to their part, and the physician should balance the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it yields to reduction, all will be well.
And if not, place [something] upon the very table, and press it down, as we have said concerning the hump, equally. However, it is necessary that the sick person lies on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the sick person's leg be quickly stretched; and it is according to this same description upon the bench; and let the physician place his right hand's palm upon the sick person's groin. Then with the other hand he is to squeeze [the leg], and with that squeezing, let him extend it downward to the knee area.
And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the sick person be stretched downward, but rather let him be raised above the ground; indeed, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard object, just as it is also necessary when his ankle is dislocated outward, according to what we have said concerning his lying upon two ankles: and it is with his face down, and the ligaments stretched, just as we have recently said.
And it is necessary that a bandage be applied with a board also over the place from which the joint exits, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the patient; and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg, and extends it without hesitation, then know that the limb has already returned as it should; then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with imemati, that is, a bandage, so that the ankle does not move to any part; and let the patient rest quietly for three days or four.
Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation has been firmly set; therefore release the patient to walk.
And if you see any softness; then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Then loosen it and make the patient walk slowly on both [legs] for several days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ On the Dislocation of the Knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to the lower part, that is, to the back. 》
And it is not dislocated to the front.
And the sign of its dislocation is, that you tell the patient to apply his leg to his thigh. 》 》 》 If it does not adhere with the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the reduction of all kinds of dislocation is, that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can already extend his leg over it, if he is able, and let your back be against his face; and place his foot between your feet.
Then make the knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers on his knee. Then apply both sides of the knee with your palm firmly. And another assistant should extend the foot until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of a successful reduction is that the leg adheres gently with the hip, not forcefully.
Then apply a plaster to it, and make the leg adhere with the hip. Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days. Then unbind them.
And the patient should not walk for some days until he is healed.
But if the reduction of it is resisted, then apply strong traction with bands, as was previously described in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns to its place.
¶ On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes it is completely dislocated. And its dislocation occurs either to the inside or to the outside. ›
The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and protruding towards the side to which it has been dislocated.
The treatment of its slight displacement is easy reduction; and that is to extend it gently with the hands and equalize it until it returns.
But the treatment of its complete dislocation requires that you make the patient sit upright, and have a strong assistant hold him firmly from behind his back in the middle of it.
Then take hold of his foot with your right hand from above it, and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel. ›
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with your left hand, two times.
Then extend with the left hand, and push the foot's chest with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
Do this twice, as we have told you.
Then push the foot's chest towards the leg a third time, and you will draw out the vein.
If therefore it returns once or twice according to this method, and you see the foot is even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return.
But if its reduction is prevented from you according to what we have told you, then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a nail in the ground very firmly, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have already wrapped a cloth around him, so that it does not hurt the sick person.
Then let the assistant take hold of his thigh; afterwards let the other assistant stretch the foot, either with his hands or with a band that binds around the neck of the foot. Then let every assistant stretch against the extension of his fellow; and let the nail stand between the two thighs of the sick person, holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards when stretched.
Then let the physician equalize the dislocation with his hands, and let the other assistant hold the healthy leg downwards. For the dislocation returns swiftly.
When therefore the dislocation returns and its healthful reduction is made clear to you, then place a plaster and wool, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you must be careful or fearful of the nerves that are above the heel in the back, so that the bandage is not too tight on them and hurts them.
Then leave him for two days, or three. But if the bandage becomes loose, bind it; then unbind it on the third day, or the fourth; and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days. If indeed he attempts to walk before that time, security is not achieved without the dislocation breaking up and becoming corrupt, and it will not receive cure afterwards.
If a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary that you administer to him the treatment mentioned earlier in another section on healing, and a poultice, until it is removed.
About the dislocation of the toes and their cure.
It is necessary that what is dislocated among them be put back into place with a small extension without difficulty; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
But if the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on an even place on the ground or on a table, and stand as if walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints. 》 Then press it with your foot firmly until it returns and you see it is already in place, and no prominence appears in that place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that fits the whole foot, which has two ends. Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days. Then unbind him, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured in its place. 》
About the types of dislocations with a wound or a fracture.
When something like this happens and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows; therefore one should not presume to undertake such a cure unless he is skilled in the art after long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not reckless or presumptuous; and that he use at the beginning of the treatment only those medicines which suppress hot abscesses: and leave the patient to divine judgment. 》 》 Unless you see or hope for safety from destruction with the mildness of the illness, and in which something of hope appears. Therefore, try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess forms.
If the member returns as we wish, then administer a treatment that calms the abscess; and care for the wound with one of the drying ointments suitable for it.
If the dislocation is with a fracture and separate pieces occur in the bone, then try to remove them; and do as we said in simple diseases from what precedes in their places.
And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear; as my prediction precedes for you.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and safer for your body among them at your time.
