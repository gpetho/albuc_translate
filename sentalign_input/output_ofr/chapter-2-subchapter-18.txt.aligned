Sebel are red veins that cover the eye, and impair vision and weaken the eye constantly.	Pannus is a network of blood-vessels spreading over the eye so as to interfere with the function of sight and, in the course of time, weakening the eye.	0.5429101
It is therefore necessary first that you see if the eye, in which the sebel is, is strong, and there is no other disease besides the sebel; then treat it in this manner:	You must first examine, and if the eye with the pannus be strong, with no fault other than the pannus, then the pannus should be gathered up.	0.6583207
tell the patient to put their head in your lap, then lift these veins with the hook according to your knowledge, and let the hook be subtly double according to this form:	This is done by bidding the patient put his head in your lap; then, as skilfully as you may, pick up those blood-vessels with one or two hooks. The hooks should be of a gentle curve, like this.	0.7009219

then when you pull on those veins subtly, and draw out the blood a little at a time, until you see those veins removed from the eye;	Then take up the blood-vessels gently with the fine scissors, and wipe away the blood constantly, till you see all those blood-vessels removed from the eye, and the blood wells forth.	0.77903
and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at noon in front of the sun, and be very careful in your work so that you only cut those veins;	But be careful of the eye lest you damage it with the points of the scissors. Let your work be done in broad sunlight at midday; and be very steady in your action so as to cut nothing beside the bloodvessels.	0.77964437
and when you have done this, then instill in the eye green and red collyrium to dissolve what remains of the sebel.	When you have finished, instil the red or green lotion into the eye to destroy by its caustic action the remnants of the pannus.	0.6408386
And if you are unable to remove all of it at that time, apply a plaster over the eye made of things that soothe eye pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and a warm abscess is ensured, then start again according to the method described above until it is healed;	If you are unable to gather it all up at that one time, apply a plaster to the eye such as will allay the pain, and leave him* for a few days till* the pain be eased and there is no danger of an abscess. Then repeat the operation in the same manner till it is healed.	0.79300624
