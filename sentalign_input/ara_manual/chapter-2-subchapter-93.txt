Chapter Ninety-Three.
On Incising the Disease Known as al-Nafir (The Fleeing).
This disease, which is called al-nafir (the fleeing) in our country, is a pain that occurs in some of the organs, then moves from organ to organ, and I have seen it as I describe it to you.
I was called to a sick woman in a rural area, and she uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the arm's tendon. When I remained for an hour, I saw that swelling creeping along the forearm as a worm creeps, rising to her shoulder blade as quickly as could be, like mercury. 
If it flowed from one place to another, the pain would disappear from that place and settle in the shoulder blade.  Then I sat for an hour, and it ran throughout her body until it was in the other arm. Then she told me that it circulated throughout her whole body, just as I had witnessed.
I marveled at the speed of its transfer from one organ to another, and I had not previously seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen a group of people who found the pain moving from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
And I did not consider that to be anything other than because the woman was from the rural people, dry of body, with exposed veins, and therefore this moving wind appeared to the senses. And it must be that it does not appear to this degree in people of luxury and moist bodies with hidden veins.
If you want to treat it, and its possessor feels the pain, then if it appears to you visually, as we mentioned, quickly tie above and below it and incise over it until that trapped wind comes out, and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with what expels and dissipates the winds, such as asafoetida, sagapenum, and similar medications.
