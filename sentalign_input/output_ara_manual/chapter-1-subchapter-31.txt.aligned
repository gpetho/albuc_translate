On Cauterization for Ascites.	On the cauterization of dropsy.	0.65645087
Cauterization is only beneficial in the case of tympanitic ascites specifically. If you have treated the patient with ascites with the various treatments that we mentioned in the Classification, and your treatment has not been effective, then it is appropriate to cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites.	0.47407472
And another cauterization on the liver and a cauterization on the spleen and two cauterizations behind his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open, draining pus for a long time.	When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep. Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while.	0.7033702
And do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization with what is necessary so that it brings together the two meanings, and healing will quickly come to him.  The shape of the cautery iron with which the back is cauterized should be nail-shaped as its image preceded, and the one with which the stomach is cauterized should be olive-shaped.	Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him. The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.85990953
