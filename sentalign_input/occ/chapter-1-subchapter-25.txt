Chapter Twenty-Five:
On the cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the shoulder.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to slippery humidity and it is not fixed at the time of its return to its usual position, and with a small movement it dislocates again, as we have observed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be laid on their back or on their healthy side; and then raise the tendon that is in the inner part of the shoulder to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.
And then heat the cautery with two heads; and this is the form:
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates into the other side; and the figure of the cauterization will then have four heads of the cauteries.
And make it delicate according to the amount of tendon; and this is the form:
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this calculation and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place cooked salt on the cautery, and then make the patient rest in tranquility, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done later, then cauterize on the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.
