Of the rupture of the artery
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin is healed over it, abscesses often form, and it is the same with a swollen vein and abscess;
and it is known this way when it is from the artery, the abscess is long and deep;
and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightness; and when it is from the vein, it is round and visible on the surface;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and on the neck and in many other places, and it is very large.
So it is necessary to avoid the iron treatment, and the one that is at the top should be avoided as well, and in the one that is from the swelling of the artery, cut lengthwise above the skin;
then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle under it, and pierce it to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries in the temples;
then puncture the place between the two ties with an "entromissoire" until the blood comes out, and the abscess is relieved;
then administer the treatment that generates flesh, until the ties fall off;
then treat it with suitable ointment until it is healed;
and if the abscess is from the vein, you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as you can,
then place the needle under the place you are holding, and pierce it, and place a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side;
then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with a tie on one of the two sides with the two ends of the thread;
and if you are concerned that the thread may not hold, place another needle with a thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the core and leave what is tied;
then place a cloth moistened with wine and oil on it, then administer tenting and ointment treatments until it is healed.
