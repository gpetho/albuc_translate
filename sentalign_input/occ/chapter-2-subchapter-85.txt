From the wounds of the abdomen.
The condition that occurs in the abdomen can be large, small, or moderate.
In severe cases, sometimes the intestine or nerve of the intestine protrudes, requiring their repositioning and suturing to be more vigorous and delicate.
Small disruptions are difficult to manage in another way, and so their reduction is more difficult if you do not promptly return them to their place, as they can swell and thicken, making repositioning difficult.
Thus, a moderate disruption is best, as it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, unlike in the other two types mentioned before.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen follows four methods, but two sutures are common and suitable for other body wounds.
And two other sutures are specific to abdominal wounds, but they can also apply to other wounds.
And I will explain each one to you in detail.
So I say that when the wound is small and something from the intestine protrudes and is difficult to reduce, it is due to either the smallness of the disruption, as we have said, or when the intestine has become swollen from the cold air.
And when this happens, you must warm it by soaking a sponge or cloth in warm water alone or boiling it with skink, cypress, and spikenard, and apply it to the intestine until the swelling subsides.
Sometimes, use a solution with astringent properties, which is better than plain water for reducing the swelling.
And when you see the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been boiled, as this eases its repositioning with little effort.
But if repositioning is still difficult with this treatment, then slightly enlarge the disruption with an instrument used for incising hemorrhoids.
The primary treatment is better when it is proper and not just an incision, and it should not involve drying out unless necessary.
About the instrument, according to its shape:
One part of it is sharp and curved, and the other part is not sharp, with a fine point, but not as thin as a needle, rather slightly blunt.
When the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, it must be returned to its natural form in its proper place, if possible, as this is better.
But when the disruption is large and in the lower part of the abdomen, make the patient lie on their back with their legs higher than their head; if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, place the patient's head and chest higher than the lower parts.
Similarly, if the disruption is on one side of the abdomen, always ensure that the part with the wound is higher than the other.
And so you should administer this for large and moderate wounds.
For small wounds, use what you have prepared, and ensure the assistant is compassionate, holding the disruption with their hand, adjusting the edges, and revealing the wound to the one performing the suture.
This is the common suturing method: take the needle, or count the needles according to the width of the wound; leave from the end of the disruption on the ring finger, and tighten the needle, making sure not to place the thread in both ends of the suture, with two ends of the linen under the internal parts, until you penetrate from that part; you have already gathered two ends of the suture and two ends of the linen, making four orders.
Then, tighten with double thread around the needle, sometimes from both sides together, and bring the two edges of the wound together properly; leave a finger's width and insert another needle, tying it with thread as you did with the first needle; continue doing this with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
The needles should be moderately thick, as very thin needles easily cut the flesh, and very thick ones are difficult to insert into the linen, so they should be of moderate thickness and fineness.
The needle should not be placed too close to the two ends of the linen, to avoid easily cutting the flesh and causing the wound to open before healing.
The sutures should not be prolonged so that the wound is not hindered from healing.
Cut the ends of the needles so they do not hurt the patient while sleeping; apply powders over the sutures to cover the ends of the needles and leave them until you know the wound has healed.
This type of needle suture is more suitable for small wounds, as one or two needles are enough for suturing them.
But the second suture is common: you administer the four ends, two from the linen and two from the flax, at once, with a needle threaded with equally fine and thick thread.
And when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, return the needle from the same part you started, so the thread retracts from the uppermost part to the wound, making the suture like sewing fabric where the cloth is tightened.
Leave a space between each suture the size of the little finger's thickness.
And this suture is known to people.
And with such a suture, I closed the wound of a man who had been stabbed in the abdomen with a knife. The wound was larger than a palm, and around two palms of the intestine had protruded from the middle part of the abdomen. I reduced it after the intestine had been out of the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound healed within about fifteen days. I treated it, and it healed; afterward, he lived for many years and maintained his health.
Other doctors had judged that he would not heal, but it was a miracle because I treated him without ointment, as it was a place where ointment or any medicine was not available. Instead, I applied old cotton twice a day and washed it regularly with honey water until it healed.
But I will describe two specific types of sutures according to Paracelsus.
The first is to start with the suture from the linen, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.
When the needle penetrates the linen and follows a straight path along the length of the body, leave the end of the thread in which the needle was inserted; then insert the needle in the other end from inside to outside at the other end of the wound.
Once you have done this penetration, insert the needle again from the same end of the wound, from outside to inside; leave the end of the thread on that side and insert the needle on the other end from inside to outside.
Insert the needle with the thread into the end of the wound so that it penetrates completely.
Then, start from the same side and sew it with the end of the thread on the other side. Remove the needle from the linen it penetrated, reinsert it into the linen, and sew the end of the thread on the other side with this end of the wound; remove it from the linen on that side.
Do this once and again, repeating until you have sewn everything outside according to that example.
The essence of this suturing method is to sew it with a stitch similar to leather stitching, sewing the thread from the linen once from the end, and leaving it again until it is completed.
But the second specific type of suture, which is known as Gualia, is described as follows: you sew it similarly to how some doctors sew it, by matching each part to its corresponding part as naturally as possible; and applying the end of one to the end of the wound, as I described to you.
You should place the needle at the end of the wound closest to you from the outside, making it penetrate inside at that point, leaving two ends of the thread; then, turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside at two ends of the thread.
Then, turn each one and make each one penetrate from inside to outside in two other ends of the wound that are on the opposite side.
This method of suturing is better than the common light suture and is the one I mentioned before.
This is the teaching of Gualia.
Some might say that the abdominal suture is done with two needles, each threaded, starting with the insertion of the needle from your side and making it penetrate to the other side, according to the way you would sew skins.
Know that when the disruption is in the middle of the abdomen, suturing it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
But the assessment of the wound treatment is the same as for other wounds.
The reason is that if you treat the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, sew it, and dress it properly, then you apply an incarnative powder.
If the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments that are available to you until it forms a hard scab and the threads fall out, and the skin and flesh are consolidated; then treat it as you would other wounds until it is healed.
But if you don't have medicines available, then apply old cotton as soon as it starts to discharge, changing it twice a day as instructed, until it heals, because you won't need other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound might affect the principal organs, then you should soak wool in well-tempered oil or rose oil and apply it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines, which happens often, then wash it with lukewarm astringent black wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and is making its way into the abdominal cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine is easier to heal than one in the small intestine.
It is difficult to heal because the intestine called "jejunum" does not heal well from any wound due to the large number of veins and the size of those veins, the thinness of its tissue, and its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if what protrudes from the wound is the omentum, and you manage it while it is still fresh, reduce it carefully as you would reduce the intestines.
But if it has already turned green or black, then tie it off with thread at the discolored spot to allow blood to flow, because the omentum contains veins and arteries.
Then cut below the tie and leave two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside, to relieve the tension on the omentum and allow for the drainage of the wound.
Recollection of wounds when they occur in the intestines.
When a disruption occurs in the intestines and it is small, it is possible that it can be restored in some people, because I saw someone who had been wounded in the stomach with a lance; the wound was on the right side of the stomach, it had become old and formed a fistula, and there was discharge and gas coming out of it.
So I undertook the treatment of it, even though I was not confident in its healing, but I continued to carefully treat it until it was healed and the area was consolidated.
And once I saw the area consolidated, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen to his stomach; but nothing bad happened, and he remained in good health, eating and drinking, and even taking baths and exercising as he used to.
And some experienced people have said that when there is a wound in the intestine, and it is small, it should be tied in this way: you take ants with large heads; then you bring the two lips of the wound together and place an ant with its mouth open on the two lips of the wound; when it bites and tightens its mouth, you cut off its head, as it adheres and does not come off.
Then place another ant next to the first one, and continue doing this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.
Then you reduce the wound and sew it; and those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.
It is also possible that the intestine can be tied with a thin thread made from animal intestines, which is attached to it and then threaded through a needle; you take the end of this gut thread, make it very clean, and tie it to another thread, wrap it, and then insert that thread into the needle and sew the intestine with it, and reduce it in the disruption.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then it is not healing but a refinement, and it is not a complete healing.
