of back pain	On cauterization for pain in the back.	0.5125172
When pain comes to the back, either from falling or impact or excessive evacuation, or from the spread of cold matter, cautery is useful for none of these cases, except for one caused by the infusion of cold matter.	Many different causes give pain in the back. Sometimes it happens from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation or the like. It may also be due to an influx of humid matter. Cauterization is only to be employed in this last case, which arises from an influx of cold matter.	0.7294835
It is necessary that after the patient is purged with fetid pills or similar, three lines be made on his back where the pain is, marked with ink, and in each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and capacity of the patient; and let the cautery be done with the cautery called "poins"; and if you wish, make three or four cauteries with the medium clavile cautery in this shape:	When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength. Use the punctate cautery. If you like, you may give him three or four cauterizations with the middle-sized claviform cautery.	0.86948055
