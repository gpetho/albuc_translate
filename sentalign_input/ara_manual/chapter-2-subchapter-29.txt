Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On scraping teeth with an iron instrument.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, so that corruption reaches the gums and the teeth become ugly because of it.
You should seat the patient before you with his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and the tooth on which you see the scales and the sand-like substance, until nothing of it remains. Likewise, you should do with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and so forth, until you clean them.
If what is on them goes away with the first scraping, then [stop]. Otherwise, you repeat the scraping on another day, and a second and a third, until you achieve the desired goal. And know that the molar requires scrapers of various shapes and many forms, depending on what is suitable for your work.
Because the scraper with which the molar is scraped from the inside is not the scraper with which it is scraped from the outside, and the one with which it is scraped between the molars is of another form. And this is a number of forms of scrapers that you should have all prepared.
