Chapter 32.
On the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: outward, inward, and downward but mostly backward; it is not dislocated forward.
The sign of dislocation is when you ask the patient to bend their leg at the knee; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
The method to restore any type of knee dislocation is to have the patient sit straight, extending their leg if they can; place your knees against their thigh, and put their foot between your feet; then place your palms on their knee, holding it firmly with your fingers, while another assistant extends their foot until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of successful reduction is that the leg can be easily bent without pain.
Then apply a poultice and bandage the leg to the thigh, and wrap them together with a bandage for three to four days, and then unwrap them.
The patient should not walk for a few days until they are healed and strengthened.
But if you cannot reduce the dislocation, then perform strong extension with the same bandages used in the hip treatment described earlier.
