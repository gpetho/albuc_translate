of the cautery for pleurisy
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of birthwort root, and in this manner: take a long birthwort root, the largest that you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and put it in the fire, and cauterize one cautery between the armpit and the neck, and two small cauteries a little descending on the part which is below the chin; and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, inclining a little behind; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the chest outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders; and do not press your hand, but do it lightly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron resembling a razor, and they heat it and put it between the ribs, until it comes to that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver. 
But in this procedure, there is fear that the patient will die immediately, or a fistula will develop that cannot be healed.
