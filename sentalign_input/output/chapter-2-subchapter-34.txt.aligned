On the cutting of the binding which occurs under the tongue and inhibits speech.	On incising the ligament below the tongue which is an impediment to speech.	0.8318088
This binding that occurs under the tongue sometimes is natural, present at birth, or accidental and occurs due to a wound that has healed.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural and congenital; or it may be accidental, owing to scarring from an injury.	0.8710794
And the procedure for it is that you open the patientâ€™s mouth, their head resting in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then you cut that nerve binding according to the width needed to free the tongue from its restriction.	The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth, having his head in your lap, and lift his tongue; then cut that sinew-like ligament transversely till the tongue is freed from its hold.	0.85446084
But if there is any hardness or thickening in it, and this is due to the consolidation of a wound, then you take a hook and cut it by the width necessary until you have cut the binding and the thickening is dissolved.	If it is hard and nodular, arising from scarring after an injury, catch it with a hook and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots undone.	0.6594317
And be careful not to make a fissure in the fleshy part and that you cut here gradually so that a flow of blood does not occur.	Beware of making the incision deeply into the flesh, or you may cut an artery there and haemorrhage may occur.	0.66894484
And then the incision site should be washed with rose water or vinegar or cold water; and then place under the tongue licini; this is a piece of linen that the patient keeps under their tongue each night so that it does not consolidate again.	After the cutting, let him rinse with rose-water or vinegar and cold water. Then put under the tongue a pad of linen, which the patient must keep in position at night to prevent the adhesion from forming again.	0.781619
But if a flow of blood occurs, place crushed vitriol on the site; but if the blood continues, then cauterize the site with an appropriate cautery iron. And then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.	If there should be haemorrhage, put pounded vitriol on the place; and if bleeding still prevails burn the spot with a lenticular cautery of suitable size and treat in the usual way till healed.	0.78475124
