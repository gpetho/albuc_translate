 CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX.
On flatulent hernia.
 I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture.
The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down.
Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away.
And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.
