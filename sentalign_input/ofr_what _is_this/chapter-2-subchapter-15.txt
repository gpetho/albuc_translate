of the sudden [problem/ailment/swelling] of the eyelid
When this adhesion happens to some men in such a way that the upper eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a scalpel under the eyelid, and lift it up; and stretch it with tweezers, until you cut what is stuck with a thin spatula, which is not too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can tolerate it and the too sharp spatula does not injure the eye; and make your incision, where you peel off this adhesion, lightly, so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape; and this whole adhesion is healed, and they sometimes put salty water in the eye, and rinse it with fresh water, and with an eyewash; then put a linen tent between the eyelid and the eye, and put wool soaked in egg white on the eye; and after the third day use the eyewash and healing things until it is healed.
