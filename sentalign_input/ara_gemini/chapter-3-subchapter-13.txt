Chapter thirteen on the treatment of fractures of the palm and fingers.
The metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers rarely suffer fractures, but they are frequently subject to contusions.
When a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand, the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of equal height in front of him, then place his outstretched hand on it. Then, an assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they are well-joined. At that point, a bandage and a splint should be applied if there is no hot swelling.
Then a splint, the size of the affected area, should be applied on top, having been inserted into a soft cloth.
If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make something like a ball from a piece of cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand.  Then, tie it with a long cloth, and let the splint be made of supple leather so that the leather conforms to the flexion of the entire hand, and tighten it as needed.
If the fracture is outwards, you should apply a splint from above and another splint from below in the hand so that the hand remains open and straight. Then apply the bandaging as the hand turns and connect between the fingers with the bandage.
If the fracture affects one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be aligned as necessary, then bandaged with the hand. If you prefer, you can apply a small straight splint to stabilize the fracture and prevent movement. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, align it and tie it with the adjacent healthy finger, or tie them all together in sequence, which is better, or apply a small straight splint as we mentioned for the thumb. Check during your treatment and after it for hot swelling and treat it accordingly whenever anything of this happens, as described repeatedly.
