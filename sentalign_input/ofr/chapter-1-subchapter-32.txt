of the swelling of the feet
When the feet are swollen in someone who is dropsical, and are full of citrine-colored water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not go in too deep, thus the citrine water will come out, and the cautery should be of this shape:
Afterward, make two cauteries on each leg, on the shin bone; and the cautery should be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg; and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treatment, so that the water comes out; after, treat them like the other treatments that we have mentioned.
