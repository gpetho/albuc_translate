of ear pain from cold
When ear pain comes from cold, and one has used dissolving medicines and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Afterward, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the base of the ear after you have marked the place with ink;
and make ten points around each ear;
afterward treat the area until it is healed.
