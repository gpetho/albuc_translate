On the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder
Chapter 40.
When there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder due to cold and moisture, causing urinary incontinence, cauterize the lower part of the abdomen, above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins. Apply cauterization on both the right and left sides, with a length approximately that of the thumb joint. Additionally, cauterize the lower back, using one or two cauteries if necessary, following the nail-like cautery form previously described.
