of large hanging swellings Sometimes thelul occurs in the abdomen and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "funge" because of its resemblance to them, and its root is thin, and the head large; and there are small ones and very large ones; and I saw a man who had two in his abdomen that were more similar to fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had a thin root, and were already split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.	Some people often get warts on the belly and on the rest of the body, called fungous warts, because of their resemblance to fungi. They have a slender pedicle and a broad head, the edges of which are sometimes inverted ; and some are small, whereas others of them grow very big. I myself once saw a man who had two warts on his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else; they were white and had thin pedicles. Their edges were inverted and had split open, and a humour flowed continually from them.	0.8193246
I cut them and found in one eighteen ounces in weight, and in the other six and a half, and the procedure for the incision is that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white and moist and of a thin root; then cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready in your presence.	I amputated them both and weighed them: one came to about eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces. This is the operation for amputating them: examine the patient carefully, and if he be of a humid temperament and the colour of the warts be white, and if they are soft, with a thin stalk, amputate them with a broad scalpel.	0.787017
