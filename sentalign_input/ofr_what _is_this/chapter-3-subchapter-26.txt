of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder can only be dislocated in three ways: one of which is that it dislocates downwards towards the armpit; and the second is towards the breast; and sometimes it dislocates upwards, but this happens rarely; and it does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder blade, and it does not dislocate inwards because of the nerves; and it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it slips out easily; in those who have enough flesh, it dislocates with difficulty, and is reduced with difficulty.
And sometimes it happens to some men that they receive a blow or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think it is dislocated because of this.
You must therefore examine it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is down towards the armpit, and compare the injured shoulder with the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring their hand to their nose, nor move it in any way; and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly by touch; and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reduce when it is recent, or if the patient is a child.
And the method is that the practitioner raises the patient's hand upwards, then puts their fists under the armpit, and forcefully lifts the joint upwards into place; and the practitioner raises the hand, and extends it upwards, then brings it downwards; it will return quickly.
And if it does not return as we have said within a few days, then the patient should be bathed in hot water; and the practitioner should apply softening and soothing poultices, such as a decoction of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water; then the patient should lie on their back, and a pad of wool, even, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the practitioner puts their heel on the pad, and skillfully lifts the head of the shoulder, and pulls the patient's hand; and another practitioner holds the patient's head, so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish, reduce it in this way: have a man present who is larger than the patient; and he should stand straight at the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another practitioner pulls the patient's hand down towards the belly.
And if the patient is too light, hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it can also be reduced in another way: a long stick is driven into the ground, the head of which should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but with soft cloths on top, and the patient lies along the length of the wood; then their hand is extended downwards strongly on the other side, and the joint will quickly return to its place; and if it does not want to return after all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a stick two cubits long and four fingers wide, which has a round end to be able to enter deep under the armpit, in this way:
Then tie soft cloths over the end of the stick so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit; and extend their arm along the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm at the end of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder lengthwise, and the hand should be extended downwards, and the body left hanging on the other side: the joint will go back in immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever way, you must place a ball of wool evenly under the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then tighten it suitably under the armpit, and wrap the bandage over the plaster, and bind the arm to their neck, and the arm should remain like this.
And they should eat little, until the limb is strengthened, because it will heal faster; and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not soft, then it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries with three holes, as described above in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and they cannot lift their arm up, then know that the nerves at the top of the shoulder are cut or stretched or weakened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the chest, and the breasts, or behind, is caused by a push, and stretching of the hands, and another bandage is applied there; and treat it until it is healed.
And if after healing, stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, the patient should use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
