Chapter 51:
On the incision of an abscess that occurs due to something that happens to the belly.
Many times it happens to some men in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, such lumps which are called fungal due to their resemblance to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head of it is large; and already the lips of them are inverted, and some are small, and some are very large.
And I have already seen one, and in his belly there were two lumps which were more like fungi, and there was no difference between those white ones with small roots.
And already the lips of those were inverted and split, and moisture flowed from them all the time.
So I incised those and found in one a weight of almost 18 ounces and the other almost 6 ounces.
And the operation in their incision is that you consider if the patient is moist, and the color of the lump is white, moist, with subtle roots; then you incise it with a wide spatula, and in your presence, cauterize with fire, because many times after the incision a lot of blood is expelled; and if the blood comes, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and scared, avoid incision with iron; but then take newly made lead thread, and tie it around the lump, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
Then tighten the lead thread; do not stop tightening it more and more around the lump, until it is cut off and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the lump has large roots, then in its incision, there is some cause for fear and dread, especially in one that is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware not to attempt to incise a lump that is of dark color, with little feeling, and soft touch, because that one is likely cancerous.
And I will come to the memory of cancer near this.
