 CHAPTER FORTY-THREE.
On cauterization of early hunchback.
 This disease often occurs in small children.
The sign of the beginning of the disease in a child is that he suffers shortness of breath when standing or moving, and you will find that at the end of his dorsal vertebrae there is one visibly projecting above the other vertebrae.
So when you see this and you wish to stop it, cauterize him with a cautery that should be circular so that the cauterization takes in equally all sides of the vertebra.
If you wish, you can cauterize two or three lines around the vertebra with the punctate cautery; let the punctures be close to one another.
Then dress the place with those remedies we have mentioned, till healed.
But beware of using the cautery in the deformity arising from a nervous spasm.
