Chapter Thirty-Five:
On the cauterization of atheyl near their removal.
When you remove atheyl, heat the cautery that resembles a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the removed atheyl, moving your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
Do this once or twice, because if there are many atheyl, then cauterize each one as described, and then treat them with the appropriate ointments until they are healed.
If you cauterize with a large cautery on the prominent part, it is more effective.
