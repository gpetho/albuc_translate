After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end of it, from its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Because manual operation has been neglected in our region and in our time, entirely abandoned, until perhaps its science perished and its trace was cut off: and there remained of it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and error and hesitation have befallen them, until their intentions have been obscured and their force has been weakened: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on it according to a method of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of the instruments of cautery and the other instruments of the work: since it is made by the addition of explanation and by the haste of that which is necessary.
The reason why a good craftsman of this art is not found with his own hand in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen has described, until he knows the supports of the limbs and their shapes and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number and their course, and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exits.
And because of that Hippocrates said that name is much with name, and little with work, and especially in the art of the hand.
We however already said about that in the introduction of this book.
Because he who is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy is not safe from falling into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore he arrived at it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he completed him according to his desires.
Afterwards he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained so until his leg and his foot became suppurated, and it came to destruction.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and calmness followed, and he escaped from his pains.
However, the corruption was already established in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated afterwards, until its malignancy was magnified with its master.
That is, because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb which can tolerate having the whole of it cut off.
And for that reason, O my son, it is necessary for you to know that a manual operation is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation with which is associated safety: and an operation with which there is danger in several dispositions. And I have already warned in every place of this book where an operation comes which involves terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid that, and leave it alone, so that fools may not find a way to speak and bring dishonor.
Therefore take measure with care and protection, and treat your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and laudable success: and leave terrible illnesses of difficult healing: and lift your spirits from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may not enter upon you in your faith and your well-being. For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your rewards.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.

Part I.
Concerning the help and harm of cautery: and to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Chapter I.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its helps and harms: and in which complexion it should be exhibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse concerning the quality of the help of cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science, and a hidden secret.
Also a multitude of wise men have spoken in it, and have disagreed: and indeed a little from their sayings suffices me, fearing prolixity.
Therefore I say that cautery universally benefits every complexion which is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
But in the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed.
For some have said that cautery is helpful in it.
And others said the contrary of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in the illness which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be healed with something hot and dry.
And he who says the contrary said: that through cautery help is given in every hot and dry illness which happens in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I indeed say, through his statement, because experience has already shown me that several times.
However, it is not fitting that he come to that, except he who is already proven and practiced in the chapter of cautery, in the last exercise, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the duration of them.
From the other complexions however there is no fear for you: and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For now all physicians have agreed upon them: and they have not disagreed in helping with cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not arrive except at the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with little harm.
The action of burning medicines, however, reaches that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes an illness difficult to heal in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Fire however, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from the length of speech.
And know, sons, that they disagree in the time in which it is fitting to perform cautery, and they place the better time in spring.
And I say that cautery is fitting at every time: because the harm happening because of the time is submerged in the help which is drawn with cautery.
And especially if cautery is because of pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that a greater harm may happen than the small harm entering because of the time.
And let not that fall into your minds, O sons, which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that that illness which is healed by cautery does not always have a return: and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a medicine in place, which alters the complexion, and dries the humors which are the causes, wherefore pains happen.
Nevertheless cautery surpasses medicine by the speed of its health, and the strength of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and that which comes to him in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless there is an illness in which cautery is administered. An illness subtle in a limb of few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth because of pain, and similar things, it is possible, for that pain may not return in it.
But that happens in few.
But truly the speech of the common people again, that cautery is the last of medicine, is right speech: not to that which they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure which is comparable with medicine, nor with anything else after the setting of cautery.
The matter however is contrary to that, and the intention that cautery is the last of medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it helps: then it falls out that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
The ancients however said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say that, except because of the evenness of gold, and the excellence of its substance: and they said that the place of cautery does not produce pus. That is not true absolutely: because I have now proved it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However when you heat a cautery in the fire made of gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the quantity you want, because of the redness of gold: and when it approaches cold, and if you add more heating to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Therefore the craftsman falls from it into difficulty: and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and more readily available to us, from straightforwardness for the operation.
And I indeed have now ordered this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters: and I have ordered them from head to foot: so that they may relieve him who seeks what he wants from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the control of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of headache, and of the abundance of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of much sleep, and of toothache, and of throat pain: and universally of every illness which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should prescribe to the patient: that he be evacuated first with a cleansing purgative medicine for the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the patient, and his age, and his habit require.
Then prescribe to him that he shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive cautery: this is its form. Then place it on the place marked with ink, descending, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will turn it.
Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the place.
If you see now revealed from the bone the quantity of the head of alkiel, or the quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another if it cools, until you see the bones which I told you about.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cautery in it, and place it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Then place on it the cautery soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the fire eschar is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it is healed.
Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the utmost with the cautery, until it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is done like the shape of a kirate: or the instrument which women place in the infusion of a small letter: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it is consolidated.
But to me these two kinds of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain men according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with its safety.
For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other members: and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally weak: and indeed the first kind of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore work with it safely.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it is prolonged in the patient, and he uses bleedings, and cuppings, and purgatives for the head, and oils, and poultices.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefit him: then consider.
For if the patient's head is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below that one.
Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, until the skin is pierced, and a quantity of bone, as we have described, is uncovered.
And cauterize him with one cautery in the occiput of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your instrument in this, and do not uncover the bone.
For the patient finds because of that a very intense pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I shall call this cautery in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput with a more delicate cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a caustic medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment which I mentioned in the divisions of illnesses is administered, and all this does not help: then cauterization is appropriate in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine or with iron. Cauterization with a sharp burning medicine is done as follows: you take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then incise the place of pain at the time with a wide phlebotomy knife, until a space is made under the skin into which the clove is inserted.
Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable compress, and leave it for fifteen hours; then unbind it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterwards apply a cotton pledget soaked in butter until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish to do it with some burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on burning medicines.
Cauterization with an iron, however, is in this way.
A fire cautery, whose shape is this.
And it is called a nail because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small prominence.
Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand: and you slowly revolve the iron with speed: and let the amount that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a pledget in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then place the pledget with butter: afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second knife-like end of the cautery.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When you treat a hemicrania with what we said in the preceding treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said about the first cautery with medicine, or with fire cautery, is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white after you mark on the painful area with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and place your hand in its place, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves in mastication, lest the side be burned, or the nerve which moves it, from which a spasm may result.
And be watchful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut.
For in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with it in the first instance.
And I will come with a remembrance of the regime of the flow of blood happening from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the infirm tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the manner of cauterizing in earache.
Chapter VI. When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with resolvents and the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and it is that which is named a point, whose form is this.
Then prick with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is rolled around; or around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with a hot iron: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and about that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in torticollis.
Chapter VII.
Torticollis which is cured with cauterization is only from the species which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization of the species which happens from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this species of torticollis with bleedings, and purgations, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Because softening does not happen except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the end of the upper ear under the horn of the head a little: and another in the temple: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form has been described: however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that there should be a little excess thickness in it. Then treat the place, with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery in the occiput of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Also, cauterization is done with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and this is more extreme.
Then let him be treated with what preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in oblivion.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the beginning large quantities of hiera and pills purifying the brain be given to the sick person to drink.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and apply to his occiput the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times. For this is the method of cautery: and do it according to the same order which I described there. If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
If not: then make for him three cauteries in the posterior part of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cautery the breadth of a finger.
Then treat the cauteries, with what preceded.
But if you wish an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make for him a cautery in the middle.
But if you wish an addition: then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed: and let the cautery be anointed according to the form which was stated before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with the instruments, and with that which we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery upon each horn of the head, and with a cautery upon the back of it, and with three upon the vertebrae of the neck.
But if you need in the illness a softening of the body with more of those things, and the sick person is able to tolerate it, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries upon the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cautery, until a great deal of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed: and thus cauterize with olive oil.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, except the one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with syringes, and with the other treatment which we mentioned in the division: when the patient is large, or is tolerant in the reception of medicines.
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and mouthwashes cleansing the brain are administered beforehand for many days with improvement of diet.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the method: and with another cautery in his occiput, and above every horn of his head with a cautery.
But if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded. But if the patient is a child, then apply a thin cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in melancholia.
Chapter XII.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the case of one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined towards melancholia, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him something to drink which will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a properly made compress of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting squarely should be held from every side.
Then present the liniment. And it is more worthy from old sheep butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate measured heat, which the finger can tolerate when put into it.
Then empty it in the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this for the patient once every week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it making very many small points of it, except that you hold the hand with the cautery: indeed it is by smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Then place on it a pledget soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a descending flow of water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and purge the patient with that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him on the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes at once; or on one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
But if you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and caution against the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
On the method of cauterizing in old tears.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old, constant, and are upon the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of the descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if you need addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the method of cauterizing in nasal fetor.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the medication does not help: then hasten, and give the patient hypocras to drink for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of the nail-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not exhaust your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount that burns a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn inward, pricking the eye. Chapter XVII.
Cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, however, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanse them, until they grow long and are even. But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.
When therefore they grow and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in flaxseed mucilage on the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the mark which you made, little by little in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned properly.
And a sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days.
Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some of the hairs return after a time, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did at first.
But if the hairs are below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is level so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is so that you should instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they lengthen and become even.
Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, one ounce of each or thereabouts; then grind them together well and do it quickly so that it does not get cold.
Then spread some of it on the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one or both eyes.
And place under the eye a lint compress soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
And you should move it whenever the patient feels the medicine biting; for its bite is like fire.
While, therefore, the biting sensation persists, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When, therefore, the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises with burning, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat the application of the medicine to the place where the medicine does not penetrate and blacken, until your operation is even, and the eye is contracted.
Then place a compress with butter on it until the burnt skin is removed.
Then treat it with diaphnic ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you during the operation that you observe the utmost care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens afterwards, and something fights against the hair in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did in the beginning.
Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a lacrimal fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, with what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your bosom, and let a minister hold his head between his hands in such a way that it is not moved, nor agitated with his head.
Then place a cotton swab infused in egg white, or in flaxseed mucilage, over his eye; then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish it to be upward, try it so.
However, this concave is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold with your hand a little near the cautery from the eye, toward the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the sick person is disturbed: and place the cauterizing instrument in the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If therefore you arrive at the bone with the beginning of your cautery, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it: and leave it for three days.
Then apply lint with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed. But if forty days pass, and it is not healed, then place on it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed: and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the ancients mentioned.
Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and incise it: then place in the incision a thin tube, that is, a thin cannula, of which this is the form.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the molten lead run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a compress soaked in egg white, or in water.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said, by cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to treat the opening of the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come to its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.
Chapter 20.
Very often fissures occur on the lip, which are called chaps, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then prepare a small, knife-like cautery of fire, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Chapter 21.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, then it produces pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to heat a cautery according to the size that it will fit into the fistula.
Then insert the heated [cautery] into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said concerning treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the pus is cut away and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone as far as it extends in its head.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the gums and loosened teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum is softened because of humors, and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then heat a cautery, the shape of which will come later, so that you place a cannula on the tooth; and quickly insert the heated cautery into it; and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour; and spit it out.
For the loose tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humor is dried.
Chapter 23.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in the tooth, and treatment with medicines is ineffective, then cauterization is used in two ways: either cauterization with butter or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with butter is done by taking cow's butter and boiling it in an iron spoon or in a small pan.
Then take a wisp of cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Then immerse it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth, holding it until it cools; then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; then place a heated iron on top of it until the heat penetrates to the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterization with fire is done by using a bronze or iron tube. And let there be some thickness in its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery iron to the required shape and apply it to the tooth, holding your hand there until the cautery iron cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
And in the impression of that cautery, it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in strumae.
Chapter XXIV.
When strumae are from phlegm and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and you wish their digestion quickly: then with fire a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit from the cautery at the other end: and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
But if the abscess is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it lint infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth unguent, until the shape of a tube is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice, and constriction of breath.
Chapter XXV.
When humors overcome the lung canal, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the sick person be evacuated first with solutive medicines.
Then cauterize it in the uvula near the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware, lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor into the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the juncture of the neck in the last vertebra thereof, finally: and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in illnesses of the lung and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and illness of the lung are from cold humors, and the infirm person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, soft, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be a tube according to the form which preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called a Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing of earache: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore the cauterization is alleviated with it, when you do with it in one time three cauterizations.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the armpit, in the dislocation of the humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of humidity, and is not fixed in the hour of its return from its dislocation, until that is its custom of return, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation first.
Then the sick person is laid on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then raise the skin which is in the inner armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then have a cautery iron with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauterizations.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then becomes six cauterizations: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the probe.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added in this way, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then put crushed leeks with salt on the cautery.
Then cause the patient to adhere to tranquility, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and rarely does that happen, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it away from its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied to it, and the methods of treatment are continuous, and do not help: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on the two sides of the one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And space them so that they do not join, when they produce pus. And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cautery is made be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for him who is frightened by this cautery: and it is so that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with a hot iron: then cauterize it with a pointed cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from gross flatulence, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous excretion, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and you mark with a hot iron three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity on the lower liver, below the hypochondria, where the elbow of a man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added: and let the patient stand on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who now extends his legs, and raises his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed excessively in cauterization, and burn the whole thickness of the skin, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Chapter 30.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person experiences pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharp pain; and you see now that its treatment has fatigued the physicians.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his back.
Then mark the location of the abscess with a cautery; then ignite a cautery that resembles a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the peritoneum, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment of exits, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery, except for one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged and through whose hands these illnesses concur with experience several times: then indeed may he dare to undertake this operation.
But indeed, to leave it alone is better in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is that you should take of the dried roots of birthwort, one longer root which is found among them, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat sloping downwards to the part which is under the chin.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib sloping slightly backwards; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be on the surface of the skin, burning. And now some ancients have said that there are some men who use a cautery of iron similar to a ray: and they ignite it, and they insert it inside in that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
When you treat a disease of the spleen, with what we have said of treatment in the division of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of which is to make three or four cauteries, arranging them lengthwise according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, the figure of which has preceded.
And let the quantity between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the method of cauterization be the same as we said in the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient lie on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: to heat a cautery having two prongs, which we described in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin which is over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery: therefore four cauterizations are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you remove it, that it discharges pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the other treatments which preceded it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
Cautery is not applied in dropsy, except to the ascites properly.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery over the stomach, and another cautery over the liver, and a cautery over the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one in the chest region, and another in the region of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be approximately the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization with this: for it is necessary that two intentions are combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped: according to what preceded as its shape: and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped according to what preceded as its shape.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter 34.
When abscesses occur in a dropsical patient, and are filled with a citrine fluid: it is necessary that you cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the hollow which is between the little finger and ring finger: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Then the citrine fluid will exude, and let the cautery be according to this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each of the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery: and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, about the middle of the leg: and on each hip two cauteries: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some water will exude from it: then treat it with the other things which we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in looseness of the bowels. Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of treatment, and is not healed: and you see the patient tolerating cauterization of exuberant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery: and a cautery over the alcatin above the alhosos, large, or two cauteries.
And if you see exuberant humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and a cautery over each ilium: and perhaps you will add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humors, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower vertebra of the back below the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and with a cautery below the navel as if by two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face become inflamed, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery above his liver, and another above his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut away the althelul, then you heat a cautery that is similar to a ray.
Then insert it, burning, into the excised althelul: and the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Then treat them with that which benefits them of ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more ultimate in aid.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not obey the incision and the operation which we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes old, pus and corrupt humors run from it.
Therefore, it is more fitting that you should probe it with a slender probe.
Then learn the amount of its depth with a probe.
Then heat a cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula and the amount that the nail entered. And repeat the cautery over it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount of your need.
And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all those places.
And do not do that, except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then take care of the place until it is healed.
But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a corrupt bone, or something like that from those: whose remembrance will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter 39.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold, or from gross flatulence, and the strength of the sick person is diminished because of it, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen on the kidneys, cauterizing each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, the mention of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidatu itself.
Therefore three lines will result.
Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter 40. When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, until the patient can no longer retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and with a cautery on the right side of the pubis, and another on the left: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the thumb's joint; and cauterize it with a lower dorsal cautery, or two cauteries, if you need it; and let the cautery be according to what preceded, namely the claviform cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter 41.
When cold and moisture affect the womb, and it is prevented from impregnation by this, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and she experiences pain at their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the umbilicus, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the pubis on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be claviform.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter 42.
When mucous humors are poured out to the socket of the hip, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other, when they are compared to each other: and the place of dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the socket of his hip with a cautery similar to a circle: after you mark with a cautery around the socket, as it is rotated: and that the socket itself fall in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
But if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica. Chapter 43.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good, or bad, depth.
And let the space that is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, the cauterization is done in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, with one: so that it is a circle containing the whole hip.
And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and your cautery above the ankle by four fingers towards the outer part a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And beware in all your cauterization, lest you go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and thereby draw upon the sick person great harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was entirely perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a bursting of the belly, and death after that.
But if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men have said, in the cauterization of the hip, of which this is the method.
Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or somewhat less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the quantity of a thumb-joint: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be as a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron decently fitted to the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-joint, the patient lying on his healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, with this kind of cautery, O my son, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance: and therefore, because we have found few who would endure it.
Nevertheless it is one of the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds with it its place.
The cautery however with burning medicines is such that you make two samia having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its door of bronze or iron, the length of the wall;  in the height of which are two knots or quasi-knots.
And let the space which is between both be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that which they contain be joined to one another, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip socket, the patient lying on the healthy side.
And press your hand very much upon the hip socket.
Then pour between the two circles some warm water, which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour; and let the patient endure its biting and burning, for he will find the biting like fire, until the biting ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
For it is the ultimate aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him stand in what contains water, as you did with the hip equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part of each; grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that the ray enters it: and place another glass pot under the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime some fresh water, which submerges both by a finger's breadth: after which you compress them with your hand with good compression: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over more lime: and filter until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong in sharpness, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members.
Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines are those with which ankles are cauterized, also such as tesisie, and cashew nut honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
And Galen indeed, in narrating, related the treatment of a certain man from antiquity, by which he cured pain of the hip and sciatic vein: and he magnified it as being very effective.
And he said that he did not need another treatment, and that he was healed from one application, until he related that he perhaps entered the bath carried, and came out of it already healed. And it is so that it is taken from fresh setaragi; and if fresh is not found, let dried, recent [material] be taken; and let it be ground much with some fat, and let it be placed on the hip, where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it remain for the amount of three hours, or for the amount that the infirm person feels a sedation of burning.
Then introduce him into the bath.
When therefore his body becomes dewy, introduce him into the bath-chair.
For the pain recedes, and it is healed.
And know that it is not necessary that anyone use a cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that the dung of goats, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cautery is done in this manner.
Let wool be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and is nearer to the ankle.
Then take dry goat dung, and ignite it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore do not cease doing that, until sensation reaches the middle as far as the ankle, and the pain rests.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccine cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from superfluous evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cautery indeed does not fall, except in this kind alone, which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul-smelling pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's back, after marking with heated wax five cauteries in each line, or more according to the amount that comes from the patient's tolerance and strength: and the cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a nail-shaped cautery in the middle, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in incipient gibbosity.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often happens to small infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find in the last vertebra of the back and its knots that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, according to this form.
And let the cautery take hold of every part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware lest you apply the cautery to a hump which is caused by a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing gout and the pains of the joints. Chapter XLVI.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which are poured out into any members of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of cold cause is treated with methods of cure and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that he cauterizes it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Whose form is this.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the other joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize it above each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, with this same clavus-shaped cautery. If, however, more are necessary with this cautery, then cauterize it. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said of cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are in the hands only, then puncture around the wrists, as two lines are drawn around.
If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every node a puncture, and above the ridge of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not deplete the patient of good regime, of the reception of medicines.
For if a good regime is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary that you order the patient to omit eating on his day.
And that he use lenitives, so that stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the bladder or intestine emerges or appears.
Then return it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white, and throws off sparks.
Then return the intestine or bladder to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and another servant over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on the mark, your hand with the cautery held straight.
And hold it until you reach the bone with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the bone with it in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and that death or great harm befall the patient through it.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with the other ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment for the length of time of his treatment, which soothes his bowels: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and evacuation.
Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
For when he uses this regime, thus he is healed with a complete healing.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be then as one third of it.
Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
And now some of the ancients have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with a cautery, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with the nail cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or a blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in some member from a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every member be according to its size and its suitability and its weakness and its strength and the location of the twisting and the pain from it.
If therefore it heals from the first cautery, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cautery on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to move from one member to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with cautery until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Lepers, however, are sometimes helped by cautery with the greatest benefit.
And especially the type of leprosy which arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
If therefore the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not descend nor halt: and you fear for the patient, that corruption may seize upon his whole constitution: then cauterize him upon the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two upon the two temples, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
And lastly, apply your hand with the cautery lightly, until it impresses a small mark on the skin, and the outer layers are separated from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize with the cautery also upon the spleen itself, as has preceded.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have spoken of in the head, and with a cautery upon the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries upon the two jaws, and with two cauteries upon the vertebrae of the neck, and six upon the vertebrae of the back, and one large one upon the al-hahos (haunch bone?) near the base of the spine and one above it, in the almeidati (sacrum?), and two upon the hips: namely, upon each hip one, and two upon the knees: one upon each knee, and two upon the shoulders, and two upon the elbows, and two upon the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him upon every joint, of the joints of the fingers of his hands, and feet: and cauterize upon every heel of his feet, and the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are upon the back of the heel, lest you burn them. And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery upon the pubic bone, and another upon the stomach, and another upon the liver.
And know that, the more you add cauterization, the more helpful and beneficial it is.
And know that the patient does not find pain in cauterization, as healthy people find it: because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what preceded in the types of instruments.
Chapter L.
When a limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what the size or smallness of the limb deserves.
And let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes something causing numbness, which happens to the hand and foot, is cauterized in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Truly, let no one presume upon this except he who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Chapter 51.
When an albaras becomes chronic and nothing of the medical arts benefits it, then cauterize it superficially with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with the flour of an herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part; let all these be mixed, and spread upon a cloth, and applied to the place until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cancer.
Chapter 52.
When a cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled.
The wise, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a hot cautery in the middle.
But it does not seem so to me, because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen this several times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Chapter 53.
When someone has an adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the age of the patient, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of the time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it itself will hasten with maturation.
But if you wish its perforation with a cautery, then a fire cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer. Chapter 54.
A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption in a limb which moves about and corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore if you see a corroding ulcer in a place which can tolerate cautery with fire, then have many fire cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place in which the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing at all of it remains. Then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized areas ground sulphur with oil, until all the eschars and all the corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments which generate flesh.
Therefore if you see that after three days flesh grows in a healthy way, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And a corroding ulcer is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
For it arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help: and I indeed already spoke of its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore receive it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in nails and warts. Chapter 55.
Often this sickness happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing, which harms the foot. And indeed cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for that with fire, make a concave fire cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which is made from iron, according to the size which contains the nail on every side: and let it be of thin edges.
Then place it, ignited, upon the nail. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it at night. For it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
But if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply a cautery to them with warm water: and it is so that you take a small tube of bronze, or iron, or from a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or the wart.
Then pour a small amount of warm water into the tube: hold your hand, and you roll it with slight compression of your hand, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the nail, and the warm water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little while for the biting of the warm water for one hour.
Then dismiss him, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one after another, until you come to all that are in the body.
Then care for them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Chapter 56.
When tremor happens to someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and on his stomach a cautery.
For tremor rests with the olive cautery, and the healing of the cold illness hastens. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul things are expelled in the body, that is, pustules which are made from corrupt gross materials.
Therefore it is necessary that, when they appear, they be cauterized above the whole head of the pustule with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, the tip of which has been lit with fire.
Or with the root of long birthwort.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized in the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the superfluity making them is broken, and it heals from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter 58. Very often there occurs a flow of blood from an artery which is cut near a wound, which happens externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or the cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to cut it off.
Therefore when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it hard, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out from it. Then put into the fire small olive cauteries, and many more large ones; and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood is stopped.
And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the patient. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped. Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Or medicines with the property of stanching blood are placed upon it, and it is compressed with a suitable pad.
But he who manages its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of cauterizing agents and the like, does not completely benefit him, except rarely.
But if this happens to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present: then he should begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have described, and constricting it strongly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound and over the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, pouring cold water of intense coldness over it constantly, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and is cut off. And meanwhile he should consider what he needs from a cautery, or from medicine.
End of the First Part.
Book of Surgery of Albucasis Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter, every ailment in which a cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I placed chapters there from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the searcher may be relieved concerning his search. And before I begin this, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is something terrifying that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And on account of that, caution is necessary in it more vehemently, because in the operation which is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and things like those: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes there fall to you in this art kinds of men with kinds of illnesses.
For among them is he who is enraged with his illness, and death is light to him: because of the vehemence of what he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.
And with illness there is fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his fee, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious. Therefore it is not fitting that you agree to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything of it, except after certain knowledge, which verifies with you that to which a laudable outcome arrives.
And use in the treatment of all your patients, prognosis and indication of that to which health is suitably suited.
For in that is for you help concerning the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration: because that is in His hand.
And I indeed have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: that the thing which you wish from it, and which you need, may be lightened for you.
Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this infirmity very often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife squeezes the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this sickness in others than in children: and to everyone of them whom I saw death hastened: therefore it seemed to me to omit an operation in it.
And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until it could not sit up by itself, because of the size of its head: and the wetness increased, until he died.
And this wetness indeed, is either gathered between the skin and the bone: or it is gathered under the bone upon the dura mater.
And the operation in that, if the wetness is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with one cut in width: and let the length of the incision be about two finger-widths, until the wetness flows out.
And this is the shape of a spatula.
If therefore the wetness is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
And if the wetness is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the interior, and that is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this manner.
And after the incision remove all the wetness.
Then anoint it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then unbind the ligature, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound equally.
And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the filling of water appear to you: and incise it as much as is possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of the moisture.
Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs happen to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not help: then the final treatment in this is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the patient shave his head.
Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Then let the patient bind his neck with any cloth of his.
Then consider where the vein pulsates.
And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Then mark with a cautery on each: and incise each with a sharp spatula on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let that be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and incise it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when a vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which leaps to the interior with a frequent leap.
But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of the size of three fingers.
Then mark with a cautery, and cut to the bone.
And that which it is necessary to let out of blood is six ounces, and perhaps you let out more or less than that. All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Then attend to the wound.
Then if something of the pus remains at the bone, then incise it, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors and heat in the temples, or chronic headache, severe, and similar to those: and it is treated with methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have experienced in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have related.
And the method of operation in their extraction is that the patient should shave the hair which is on the temples, and he should stretch the apparent artery in the temple.
For it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or steam the place with warm water until it appears to you in manifest appearance. Then take a spatula, which I formed a little while ago. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Then throw a hook into it, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and make it escape from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
But if the artery is small, then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not excised, the blood does not completely rise. Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
But if the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk or of alhod cords, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the consolidation of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will be sufficient for the same work.
And it is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion.
Because cautery is among those things which help to end humidities.
Therefore it is a better remedy.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that the place be filled with old cotton, and that properly made pledgets be placed upon it.
And after dissolution it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen cloths, until it is healed.
But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi, and constrict your hand until the blood is cut off.
But if none of these things is at hand, then place your finger on the place until the blood clots.
And bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness ceases, and it is constricted as much as is necessary.
And of what is lighter and easier for extraction of an artery, it is to cauterize a vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Because if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than every work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with a cautery: and place both very hot, until they arrive at the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is lengthened.
For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Concerning the care of sharp, constant flow of tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull, and nothing of the healing of medicine contributes to them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already reddened, and he feels in his forehead a crawling, like the crawling of ants; and his eyes are thinned, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion; and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients needed in their cure this operation, and they named it a cure with the Knife.
And it is, that you should order the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Then incise three equidistant fissures in the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles, and the third from the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are on the two sides: and lengthen your hand from the continuation of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and let you have a prepared piece of sponge, or much dried cloth, with which you dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is soon the form.
From the incision which is from the side of the temples, up to the second incision: and flay with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the periosteum, which is upon the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh connected with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, clean the places of the clots of congealed blood. Then put into each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place over them pledgets soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, untie the ligature, and administer much infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter V.
When sharp, acrid, and persistent catarrhs occur to someone, and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their vision already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is sharp, painful headache in the depths of the head, and sneezing follows; then know from these occurrences that those matters and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the best treatment in these cases is this.
And it is that you should instruct the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision go to the bone: and extend your hand from the temples' sides, which move during mastication, until the bone is uncovered: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cotton, or with linen strips.
Then bind it above with powders; and moisten the powders with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you unbind it, and you see that the hot abscess is now lessened, then it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen which makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of rosin: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear. Chapter VI. Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from those which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if then you see the stone, then instill into the ear something of perfumed oil, or sesame oil.
Then manage its extraction, and make him sneeze with sneezing powders, and obstruct the nostrils at the coming of the sneezing, after you place around the ear pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
For very often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then manage its extraction with forceps, that is, fine tweezers: whose form is this.
If therefore it comes out with forceps, it is good.
And if not, then manage its extraction with a small, slightly curved, blunt hook. If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a cannula of metal, and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear deeply, and plug what is around the cannula with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except through the cannula: then draw it out with your strong suction. For very often it comes out with what we have described.
But if it does not come out in this way: then take a little of *helkalimbat*, or of birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught: and put it on the end of a probe after you have neatly wrapped cotton around it: then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then hasten to incise, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is that the phlebotomist first bleeds the patient in the cephalic vein: and draws out blood from him according to his strength.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with what instruments you can.
Then sew up the incision quickly and treat it until it heals.
But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then manage its extraction.
But if it does not yield to exit, then take a thin, delicate spatula, according to this shape.
And use it to cut away that type of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do that when you think that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you put it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a thin probe, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thus eased.
In the case of water entering the ear, the patient should use sneezing with the head inclined forward; and he should fill his ear with some old cotton; and he should lie on the ear in which the water is.
If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, about the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and let him stand on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Therefore let him not cease doing this with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
And then the water comes out so that you take from papyrus or from a reed one, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then repeat another reed, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and draw it out with a tube as was previously described for the stone.
But in the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is small, like a flea and the like, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which is apparent to the senses: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all things held in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore something of worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates: then suck with it with strong suction.
Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then seal around the cannula with wax, as I said in the case of the stone.
But if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer distillations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, with which you pour oils and medicines into the ear, be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Therefore let that which pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula be made neatly of bronze.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap cotton around its end neatly: then pour oil, or juice, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the rod with the cotton on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be warmed a little with fire: and beware that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of obstruction occurring in the ear.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes certain infants emerge from the wombs of their mothers imperforate.
And it has also happened to some men that there is obstruction in the passage of the ear from a wound, or from flesh growing there.
And this obstruction sometimes occurs in the depth of the opening of the ear, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens near the exterior of the opening, and sight reaches it.
Therefore that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which sight does not reach, is in most instances difficult of cure.
And in that which sight reaches, it is necessary that you place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see the apparent obstruction, open it with a thin spatula, the shape of which is as follows, let its end have a certain small width, part of which is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a thin hook, and cut it with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the obstruction is in the depth of the ear: then take a slender, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the passage of the ear.
If therefore you feel the obstruction with it, which the patient experiences with difficulty of hearing, attempt its opening with ease: and beware lest you injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a pledget according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take a pledget, and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle on it crushed zegi, and use it.
But if you see the ear already festering: then it is necessary that you remove the pledget, and leave it with another pledget, which you will wrap in cerate which is made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding should occur: then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the aforesaid bleeding in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of a sty on the eyelid.
Chapter VIII. These styes which occur on the eyelids, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps; or with a hook, and incise them with a spatula from their roots.
Then apply crushed verdigris to the site.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision.
For often they return when something remains of their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and do not return.
Concerning the treatment of the eyelids' hailstone.
Chapter IX.
Very often something happens in the eyelids which resembles a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called a hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation in them is that you consider then, if it is a hailstone proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and they are moved to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore find a fissure on it lengthwise.
Then flay it from every side easily, until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient in something.
But if the fissure is large, then join it with a suture; and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and fleshes it.
And if the hailstone slopes towards the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the hailstone with a hook; except that you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that does no harm at all.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water: and treat the place with that which fleshes, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the stye of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
A stye is fat which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid: and it happens mostly to children: and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and therefore you see them lying down on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which swelling has now covered: and the prominence of the stye is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the stye between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should put his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a pledget in it, and make from that pledget a circle according to the size which contains the stye on every side.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the stye may be collected in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions in width, and let not the incision be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you should incise the whole skin, until you arrive at the stye; for in many dispositions the stye proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore draw it out with the cloth, which you have infiltrated between your fingers to the exterior: and you revolve your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and beware, lest you add to the incision, so that you do not arrive with the lancet to the eye, and injure it.
But if the stye does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you shall add a little to the incision with ease, until the stye comes forth.
Then draw it out, as we have said.
Then submerge cloths in vinegar and water, and place them upon the place, and bind it with powders.
And some men grind salt, and put it in the hollow of the incision, that what remains of that moisture may be liquefied.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if it happens in a place of a hot abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it is wrinkled as it ought not to be.
Chapter XI.
When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural hairs, and grow against them, then they harm the eye and cause various sicknesses, such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids, and a whitening, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was stated in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let that be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula, falling from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth: then mark over the eyelid with a cautery, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the figure is made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because it is already diversified in men.
For there is one who needs a large quantity to be cut from the eyelid, according to the quantity which is softened from the eyelid. Then with a spatula incise upon the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, such as is the thickness of a ray.
Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then flay it entirely. Then bring together with a suture the two lips, with needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and cause to adhere that which superabounds from the threads upon the two eyebrows, with some sticky things, if you wish to do that: and if not, do not care.
Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days; afterwards treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
For the eyelid is raised at the closing of the wound and its joining: but it will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment, Ataxmir.
However, there is concern about the patient, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have related.
Then raise the eyelid with three hooks separated, or joined together, according to this form which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold a hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and join the threads between your fingers with evenness.
Then raise your hand with an even raising: and raise the skin over which the whole has been marked, as we have related.
Then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it, until it is healed.
But if an abscess should occur at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cautery, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is, that you turn back the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have related.
Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each over that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two reeds from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. For the constricted skin will die, and will blacken, and will putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then treat it until it is healed.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two cannulas, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in this is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then bring together its ends, and knot each with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place in Alinxotati another fine thread under it shortly, and knot its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient put his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation may be clearly seen: because it is a subtle, or small, operation.
Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotati: and insert that hair into the Alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the Alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have put in it, until the Alinxotati comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with the sight of your eye: then indeed you will pull the Alinxotati, and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it will be lifted with it; or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Concerning the care of the Alxatrati which happens in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental therefore is made from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is that you split that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in what is between them a linen pledget, and tie it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water in which mallow has been cooked, linseed: and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it a pledget, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all your ingenuity that it not consolidate, according to the form which it had at first.
And this indeed operation which we have spoken of, is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return entirely as it was. Concerning the care of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs below, is that which is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one is caused by a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, on which there is double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread arrives at the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and incise it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: until, when they are joined together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its lower sharp edge, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts: sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have spoken of, softening medicines, and linen cloths, until they are healed.
And if an abscess occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a linen cloth, according to what we said.
And the sum of the discussion of the treatment of an abscess, when it is above, or below, is, that the operation should proceed, according to what is prepared in the form of an abscess.
For it itself is of many diversities in form: and the skillful surgeon prepares the instrument in whichever way is possible for him, until he restores the form to the natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many preparations.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many men, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and raise it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not with the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather is somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you scrape away that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the whole adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or instill into it a decoction made from ziniar dissolved with water.
Then separate the eyelid and eye with linen cloth: and place on the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use a decoction, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that a nail is according to two methods. Or it is sinewy: and is similar to hard, thin fat.
Or it is not sinewy, similar to congealed white moisture: which when iron touches it, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not become fixed in it.
And both types do not begin except from the larger lacrimal duct, until it gradually goes, until it covers the sight, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on its incision is: that the patient should place his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the nail with a hook of little curvature, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair to its end.
Then incise the remainder at the root of the lachrymal duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the lachrymal duct, so that a constant flow of tears may not result from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with thread, as we have said.
Then scrape with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
And beware lest the spatula touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye some crushed salt, or something made from *sief* from *ziniar*, and leave it until another day.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed. But if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and is healed as I have narrated in the division.
But if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the patient, and take a thin, smooth spatula of weak sharpness, according to this form.
And shave the nail from above with reason and subtlety.
But if you see that it is rarefied and broken, and the shaving impresses upon it, then distil from your hour into the eye [a medicine] made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt: and obstruct the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation on it, until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess contrary to it in the eye; for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it heals. Then repeat the operation on it with reason, until it heals.
However, if the prominence of the lachrymal flesh causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and incise a part of it; and do not make the incision excessive, so that the flow of tears is not obstructed.
Then instill into the lachrymal duct  red  sieff, or that made from zinziber, until it heals. Concerning the incision of the albuginea, and flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes a red, fleshy growth develops in the eyes of some people, which is either superimposed or grows until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or constricts over the eyelids, and perhaps inverts the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a balaustine rose.
And the operation in this is also that the patient places his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps, or a pair.
Then incise the flesh at first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel.
And beware of the eye, lest you injure it during the operation: and let your incision be that with which you incise it, either with a spatula, which we described in the incision of the nail; or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and all the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distil into it red powder, and things similar to it from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye outside cotton with egg white: so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
But if some of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes an abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which happens in the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you remove the treatment of every weak eye, from a natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron; and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerating that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the sight from its function; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which is Sebel is strong, and there is not in it any illness besides Sebel: then collect its Sebel.
And it is so that you should instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a subtle double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined in one body, according to this form.
Then collect with subtle scissors those veins subtly, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are resolved: and beware lest you injure the eye with the ends of the spatula.
And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red copper sulfate: so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sebaceous matter.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until its pain is settled and it is secure from hot abscess: then repeat on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the [nasal] bone to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians name a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what its previous description was, Arissati.
And if it is not healed, then there is no other method except to incise above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus that is in it, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called the head of the rough [instrument].
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which is pointed with a file's pointing, or with a subtile aliskilfer pointing: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped: and do this several times.
Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped: and do this several times. Then restore the place with drying styptic medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident happens in it: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is nothing in it but to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this form.
And it is, that you uncover from the second bone with an iron, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a trephine according to this form, let its iron end be triangular: and let its wood be a pyramid tapering to the end, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the lachrymal duct: and lengthen your hand from the eye a little.
Then revolve your hand with the trephine, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this that he finds wind exiting from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with drying styptic medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens: then the matter which was poured out to the exterior, returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter upon the patient.
Concerning the reduction of a protrusion of the eye. Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then you bleed him; afterwards you apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye from above with a plaster with many powders.
And the method of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth of them is doubled over fourfold: make many of them: then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if the binding is again loosened, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the binding after a day and a night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the condition of the tunic, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the powders, and the binding, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the grape tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the grape tunic, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grape, and the appearance of the man is marred because of it, and it is necessary to incise it: then the operation on it is, according to what I relate: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Then introduce another needle in which is a double thread from the lachrymal side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the grape around the needle; and tighten it much.
Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool infused in egg white; and leave it, until the thread falls with the grape.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the grape is constricted from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large prominence.
Then it is perforated with a fine spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white humor flows, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it, until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This sickness which is called Alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
And the method of operating on it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Then take his head with your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus arrive at the lower parts of your eyes.
Then it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is resolved: and the sick person sees things as he saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and pierce with it above the corneal membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the crown, until the pus comes out.
When therefore it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter 23.
We have already spoken of the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation in a declarative and explanatory speech; then take that same [instrument] according to the health [of the patient].
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the infirm one sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his sound eye, and bind it tightly: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is the water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the tip of the almond near the cornea by the thickness of a ray in the very apparent whiteness of the smaller lachrymal eye: then push the almond with force: and you turn with it your hand, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now reached the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and that is the cornea of the eye.
For you will see them in the pupil itself by the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then put the almond up to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond comes out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almond with ease: and you revolve your hand gradually. Then dissolve something of clear gem salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Then place outside the eye all the lint, or wool soaked in rose oil, and egg white: and bind with it the healthy eye.
But we, and those who are of our time, place upon it crushed cumin with egg white.
But if the almond does not obey you at entry into the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore pierce with it only the conjunctiva, and do not put your hand in the hole: and it is only that you make a subtle way to the place of the almond.
Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a properly made bed be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be forbidden all movements, and from coughing: and put his food that by which his nature is soothed: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain in its place until the third day. Then unbind it in that dark room, and test his sight: and make him see things.
Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that he do this at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather it is fitting that he avoid it: because water quickly ascends through strong staring.
But if a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary to unbind the eye before the seventh: and treat it with that which calms the abscess, until it is calmed: then restore his sight, and place over his face a covering by which his sight is governed under it for some days, he being in that dark room.
Then let him gradually leave the house, and converse in his rooms.
And know that in the cautery the pupil is not excused from sight sometimes: for then he should dare the operation.
And now indeed there has come to us someone from those who are from Alayrach, who said that there was made in Alayrach a perforated tube, by which water is sucked up.
Truly therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has made it: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of kinds from the tube, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made of bronze properly: and let their extremities be triangulated with this same subtlety, and a sharp extremity.
Forms of the tube.
Concerning the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter 24.
Sometimes diverse fleshy growths arise in the nose, of which some resemble a many-legged scorpion; and of these there is cancerous flesh, stony, dark in color; and of these there is flesh that is soft, not dark in color.
Therefore, in that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, you ought to make the patient sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and thrust a hook into that flesh; then draw it outwards, and cut what you have grasped of it with a thin sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
But if something remains of it whose excision is not possible, then shave it with one of the thin instruments easily, until nothing of it remains.
But if the blood overwhelms you, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is necessary; or if it is of malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar and water, or wine, should be poured into the nose after the incision.
But if the nose opens and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that he is now healed.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot the amount of a finger, or less; and let the patient insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to azer; and let him draw it through until it reaches the cavity and emerges over his throat.
And indeed, boys often do something similar to this in schools; and it is an easy thing for one who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges from the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then take and saw the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread: and after wiping away the blood, place in the nose a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then, at the end of the matter, place a lead tube in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
But if it needs treatment that dries, use that.
To make a head-purger, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purger should be full, uncovered; which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish of juices and fluid substances.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the care of nasal polyps.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp grows in the extremity of the nose, and becomes large, and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it in the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it.
Then place on the location either a cautery, or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed, until it becomes large, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron; because it is a cancerous abscess.
For many times I have seen someone who incised such an abscess, and great harm resulted from it to him who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible in its entirety, then empty the diseased part, and incise it without fear, without dread; and treat the place with that which dries and constricts, until it heals.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation benefits little, except in certain men.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you ought to consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture: then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each part has healed: then it is necessary that you scrape away all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds.
Then bring together the two lips with suture, and bind them, and powder over it dragon’s blood, and crushed olibanum: and place over the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then unbind it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suture is, that you bring together the solution of continuity, either with needles, as we have related in the suture of the belly: or bring together the solution with thread, as I have made you know.
Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many people indeed often have abscesses in their inner lips, hard and similar to grains of barley: and some of them are smaller, and others larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and incise over each knot, and suspend it with a hook, and incise it on every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with crushed alum, until the bleeding stops.
Then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with it, where there is astringency, until the wounds heal.
Concerning the incision of flesh grown over the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore it is necessary to lift it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and incise it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Then place pounded zegi on the place, or other styptic, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment—for it often returns—then incise it a second time and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, foul crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums; and sometimes they blacken, and turn yellow and green, until corruption from them reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Therefore you ought to make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where you see crusts and things like sand, until nothing of them remains; and similarly deal with the blackness, greenness, yellowness and other things until they are clean.
If therefore that which is on them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and a third, until at last your intention is achieved in what you wish.
And know that a tooth needs scrapers of different shapes and many forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; because the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared and ready for you, which you see.
Concerning the extraction of aching teeth.
Chapter 30.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth for its pain with all skill, and delay its extraction.
For there is nothing to replace it when it is extracted, since it is a noble substance: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to extract it, that the aching tooth be firmly and certainly grasped by you.
For often pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a sound tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not depart, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen this from the practice of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certain to you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and the patient's head between your knees:  having now held it well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on every side easily, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and bind it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening on it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you act carefully with scarification around the gum on every side abundantly.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the patient from that harm which is greater than his first pain.
And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness concerning its eradication, beyond what we have related.
For very often they cause great illnesses to happen to men, which are more difficult to break, and all its roots, or some of them, remain; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that. Then let it be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. But if a flow of blood happens from the places (for it often happens), then grind something of zegi, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long ends, a short, thick handle, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied to the tooth with them: let them be like you see thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not yield themselves, nor bend: short ends, and be made of good iron, or of well-made steel, with straight ends: and at their ends let there be teeth, some of which fit into others, and grip with a decent, strong constriction.
And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, in the eradication of a tooth, something remains broken, then it is necessary to place a poultice with butter on the place for one or two days, until the place softens: then introduce into it a small hook or forceps; the ends of which resemble the mouth of a bird which is called a stork.
This, however, is the shape of the forceps.
Let their ends be made like a file within; or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully expose the whole root and flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small lever, of which this is the form.
Let the end be short, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, lest it break.
If therefore the root comes out through it, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments, whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular at the end, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular end, slender.
Also it is helped with this instrument having two branches, of which this is the form. And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
Also let there be help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness, so that it is not broken: and let it not be imbibed.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then investigate it in its place with that which is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gest, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be tightened, or held with it, and not escape and go, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then shave it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the sawing of teeth protruding above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an unsightly form is produced thereby; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are of low birth.
For if a tooth has grown after another tooth and is not located, or its sawing or filing is possible, then eradicate it; and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and it is made of tempered iron, very sharp at the end.
And let your incision, by which you incise it, be in many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of tempered iron, of which this is the form.
Let it be entirely of tempered iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed little by little in many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally shave it with some razors.
But if it is a tooth from which a part is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed and made even; and it is made smooth, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold threads.
Chapter XXXIII.
When a concussion and shaking happens to the front teeth from a blow or fall, and the sick person cannot bite on what he eats so that it does not fall, and you have treated them with styptic medicines and the treatment has not worked, then the method is to bind them with gold wire, because silver turns green and rots after a time; but gold never changes.
And let the wire be moderate in thinness and thickness according to the amount that it encompasses between the teeth.
And the method of binding is that you take the wire and insert a double portion of it between two healthy teeth; then you weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether it is one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving up to the point where you began; and tighten your hand with skill and wisdom until it is not moved at all; and let your tightening, by which you tighten the wire, be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both together and twist them with pliers; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain thus bound.
But if it loosens or is cut, bind them with another wire, and it will remain thus for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the method of binding two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the fall of both, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and this is only done by a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes something is fitted from a calf's bone: and it is made like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is supported and bound, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Chapter 34.
But if in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and it is from the healing of a wound: then throw into it a hook, and split it across, until you incise the ligament, and the knotting is released.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded alum on the place. But if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a sluggish cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a ranula which forms under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large until it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark or black color, hard, to which the sick person feels no sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw in it a hook, and incise it with a thin spatula, and free it from every part.
But if blood overcomes you during your operation, then place on it crushed alum until the bleeding stops: then return to your operation, until you remove it completely.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the remaining appropriate treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin, then it must be incised.
And the operation in it is that you consider before its operation if the heat of its abscess has quieted completely, or is diminished by some lessening; then therefore make the sick person sit before the sun, and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let a servant take it between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the form. Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your vision falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you pull something of the tunics with it.
Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form that follows.
It is similar to scissors; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply; therefore take care that it is made of tempered iron, or imbibed alfuled.
But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you incise one tonsil, incise the other according to this same kind of incision.
Then after the incision let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if a flow of blood should happen to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to them from among the styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses are produced in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed already treated a woman of an abscess which had formed between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, little sensation, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had put out two branches, until they came out above the two openings of the nose.
Therefore I hastened, and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Then I cut it off, where I grasped it from the opening of the nose.
Then I did that to the one which protruded from the other opening of the nose.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and nothing but a little blood flowed from it: therefore the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I incised, until it was excessively prolonged and with it that.
Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stopped from addition: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the incision of the uvular abscess.
Chapter 37.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
And that which is aggregated from it, round, and has no length, and is bloody, or brown in color, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For in it there is fear for the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I described, from its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, whose description preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I described in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise more of it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we recounted in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened by incision: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with a sharp instrument: and it is, that you place the patient's head in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Then take of the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it unquenched lime, and put it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let the extremity of it in which the medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva may run from his mouth from the inner medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat and injure him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you shall hold it over the uvula for the space of half an hour, until you see it now blackened, and the biting of the medicine quieted.
And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the pledget with medicine, and introduce the spoon with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula. Do this many times, until you obtain what you wish of the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it: for it dries and falls off after three or four days.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and clean with it what is around it of the medicine: and let it be rinsed with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with lotions, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further removed from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this way.
Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and mix all of them, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be luted with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which there is a pomegranate, be introduced into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is very darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you do this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess.
For it often adds to the abscess: and it is not fitting that you do that except at the decline of its hot abscess.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end eggshell: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is among good treatments with health.
Concerning the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or fish spine, or something else sticks in the throat.
Therefore it is necessary that you extract what of them is apparent, upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument toward the sun, and it is shown to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the sick person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge; and tie it on a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it arrives at the place where the splinters or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at its end let there be a curve, which he may easily insert into his throat; and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing should occur, and push the bone or splinter with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
But that the patient himself insert it is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him push downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the amount prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I mentioned in the division concerning treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine in the patient's throat before the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument I told you about.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps delicately.
But if it is not possible with them: then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the patient's throat as far as the throat: then insert into the concavity of the cannula an iron heated with fire.
Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls off.
But if it does not come out with what we have narrated, then fumigate the patient with bugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I narrated in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, because it itself will fall off.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then throw in the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall off.
And if it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore it is necessary that it comes out with this regime.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is removed from the throat, when it falls upon the uvula.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to what comes to mind concerning them, namely one and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and that which it contains of humors.
And the second way is because of the places in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And among abscesses there are some which it is not necessary to perforate except after the maturation of the pus in them and its completion: and there are some which it is necessary to perforate while they are raw, and are not matured according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its being prolonged until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or there is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either it, or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end that which is not healed. It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess, which is matured according to completion: and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the abscess: and other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more vehement prominence: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places, in which there is no reflection.
However, in those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its lips and its depth are hardened.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body in necessity: or according to that which the member needs.
And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation: or many incisions similar to the size of the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out: and incised when it has become like a cloth, and has become to the point that it is dead: as that which happens in many, such as boils and buboes.
And some of them are those which are cut with a three-angled incision.
And some of them are those from which is incised as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Such as the abscess of the groin.
And some of them are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered: and similar to them from among the incisions.
However, that which does not have a head, such as are mild superficial abscesses, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial or only a flat perforation.
And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time: rather, extract from it a part of it.
Then stop up the abscess until another day.
Then extract something of the pus again.
Do this many times according to a gradual process, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old, decrepit person; for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the body with the exit of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and consider.
Therefore if the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply linen cloths, or old tow.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of perforation, then it is necessary that you insert a linen cloth into each fissure, until they meet each other.
And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then it is necessary that you fill it with old tow, or as when cloth is woven, or is shaved with linen fluff without moisture: and bind it up until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and apply it to the place of bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and the treatment, and the powders, which I have recounted in many places of this our book, and from the division.
But if it is in the winter time, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse powders with warm wine and oil: and place them on the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place powders soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all that cold.
Until when it will be the third day, as we said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the way of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment in detail individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the skin of the head.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the species of Nodes, which contain tunics, which are sacs for them: as if they themselves were the wattles of a hen.
And their species are many.
Some of them are fatty; and some of them contain a moisture similar to mud; and some of them contain a moisture similar to gruel and porridge; and similar things; and some of them are hard, stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as the artery does not oppose the incision.
And the operation in their incision is that you should explore them with an instrument, the form of which comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it is that which contains moisture, then cut it with a longitudinal incision, a superficial incision: according to this form.
And begin with an incision from line b. to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For very often it returns, if anything of it remains. Then dip a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains of the cyst. Then repeat the application of a pledget with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it according to this method, making a cruciform incision; and draw out the hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it on every side; and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
And similarly proceed in the case of an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, as we have said. And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier, because it contains little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, with which there is no moisture at all.
Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from treatment.
Concerning the incision of the strumae in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those which of them occur in the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from one another: and every struma of them is within its own tunic, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the species of these strumous swellings are many.
And of them indeed there are stony ones: and of them there are those which contain humors: and of them there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose manifest color is near to that of the skin, and moves in every direction, and is not connected with the nerves of the neck, nor with the jugular vein, nor with the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary that you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b to line g, and flay it from every part: and extend the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is necessary to be cautious, lest a vein or nerve be cut.
And let the spatula not be very sharp: lest it should injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein or artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put into the wound crushed alum, or some powders which staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess ceases, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to fester.
For the blood is stanched. Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then take care of it.
If the entire pustule is incised, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound; and sew it up immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then it is necessary that you strive to incise its root and remove it: and administer the suture which we have described.
And which of the pustules contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Then, after the perforation, administer a pledget with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound to be already cleansed: then take care of it with an ointment generative of flesh, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said that this incision is in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
However, in those having quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided: since no help is given by it; because all the veins and the lung are weak.
But in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no illness in the windpipe, it is necessary to use incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the loss which comes from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should incise the epiglottis beneath three or four rings of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in that which is between two rings, to the extent that the incision is in the fat, not in the cartilage: and this place is indeed suitable for incision, because it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
But if the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then let him incise the skin until he reaches the windpipe; let him avoid a blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Then let him cut the fat which we have described: and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it, along with what is broken, and by loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The sum of this discourse which we have narrated is this:  unless they see that one of these abscesses has already obstructed the throat of the sick person, and the sick person is close to death, and wishes his breathing to be cut: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe through the place of the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they order the wound to be left open, until the malignancy of the illness is consumed, and its malignancy is three days, or thereabouts: then therefore they order the wound to be sewn, and to be treated, until it heals.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the windpipe.
And I was called to her cure, and I found her roaring, like the roaring of the dying.
Therefore I uncovered the wound, and I found the blood which had flowed from the wound to be small.
Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the gullet: and wind was coming forth from the wound.
Therefore I cleansed and sewed up the wound, and I treated it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state.
Hence therefore I say: that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
And it is according to two ways: for it is either natural: or it is accidental. In the natural one certainly there is no pus.
Accidental, however, is according to two ways: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
And the other way, is similar to an abscess which is made from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that presumption be made to it with iron, except in that which is small: and you prove it, and investigate it with a probe.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected with some vein: then cut it, as nodes are cut: and extract it with what it contains of a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore its whole.
Then treat the place with what is necessary of treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision upon the kinds of nodes.
Chapter XLV. There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already described all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I relate here the difference between a Node and an Exitura, since it is doubt-making. I say therefore, that when an Exitura is heat and fever and vehement pains, until the boiling over of superfluity is settled, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed fever and heat are quiet.
With a Node however there is not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in a kistis sifachin, which is its own sac, and is according to the color of the body: and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger and smaller.
And they are according to two kinds: either fatty: or containing humidity.
And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division. It is necessary therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a Node, that you examine it, and investigate it first with an instrument which is called an Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is after this.
And the method of investigating abscesses, and all Nodes is, that you take this instrument, and insert it into the most moist place which you find in the abscess: and you roll your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which comes out in its track.
If therefore a running moisture comes out, whatever its color may be: then incise it with a superficial incision, as I said in the case of other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore incise it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and preserve the kistin if you can over it, so that you may extract it whole with the Node.
But if the kistin bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns in most cases.
But if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place over it what sits on a warm abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
If therefore the Node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with that which incarnates. But if you have a pulsating or non-pulsating vein contrary: then hasten, and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood ceases: then return to incise what remains of the Node.
Concerning the instruments for incision and perforation.
Chapter XLVI.
Of these are the shapes of the intromittents, and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one.
Let them be made of well-tempered iron, with square ends, so that they readily enter the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the perforating instruments, and one of them is called *beris*, that is, perforating; and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes by means of them, from what is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of bronze, or of brass, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those made of bronze.
And probes are also made of black lead, which are suitable for probing fistulas, whose cavities have curves, so that they may gently follow those curves.
And again they are of three kinds. For of them some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the size and narrowness of the fistula. The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds. For some are simple, that is, those which have one curve; and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And of them there are blind hooks; and they are of three kinds.
And of them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and of them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three kinds: for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small.
Their ends which make the incision are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that with them help is given in the skinning of nodes for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick man may be healed by them, and find some peace from the burning which he finds in the skinning of an abscess.
These are the magdae, and they are of three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a probe, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is a hidden spatula point: and in it it runs to the inside, and to the outside when you wish, as you see.
The form of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be thin.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be with you, large and small: so that you may cut off blood with speed by means of them when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them in the cutting off of blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the thighs of the leg, and the hip, and the thighs of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, from fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes small instruments are made from them, similar to the husks of figs, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Concerning the care of the breasts of men which are similar to the breasts of women.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed upon the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain badly festering.
Therefore, he who abhors that, ought to cut above the breasts with a lunate incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay all the fat.
Afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the nipple inclines downwards, and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it ought to be incised on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to a lunar figure, each of which is joined to the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards flay the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about suture and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it is healed.
But if you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the patient's unease, or because of the flow of blood: then you ought to fill the wound with a pledget soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the nipple.
Chapter XLVIII. Those abscesses which occur under the nipple are of the hard kinds of strophulae, which contain cysts, and some of them contain humours.
Therefore, those which contain humours ought to be incised with a lunate incision, in this manner, from line b to line g. When therefore all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then fill it with old lint and leave it until another day.
Then let the lint be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
But if the abscess is of the kind of nodes of strophulae, then incise it as we said in the section on strophulae equally.
But if the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said previously.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and vein.
Chapter 49.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it is consolidated, then an abscess often results from this; and similarly it happens with a vein also, that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, collected deep in the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking in it.
And that which is due to a vein, is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is a mistake, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, upon that which is of them from the swelling of the opening of an artery, make in the skin a longitudinal incision.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is uncovered.
Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it is healed.
But if there is an abscess because of a section of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible for you of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of a grape, from two parts with two ends of thread. But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until when that which is in it comes out: then incise the superfluity of the skin, and leave that which is bound of it.
Then place on it a small cushion which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment, which is done with linen cloths and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning an abscess which happens from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess happens in nerves: which happens in them through percussion, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things; and it happens most in the places of the joints, or heel, and in every place in which the joints move; and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in most instances without pain: and when it is squeezed forcefully, the infirm person feels in it something like numbness.
And it is not an abscess gathered deep in the body, rather it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the back.
Therefore, what of them is in the joints, ought not to be invaded with iron.
Perhaps contraction will happen.
But in that which of them is in the head, or in the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and close the wound with suture: and treat it, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the abdomen.
Chapter 51. There happen to some men oftentimes in their abdomens, and in the rest of their bodies,  thelil, which are called Fungals, because of their similarity to fungi.
Whose root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
And I indeed once saw a man, and in his belly were two thelil, which were more similar to fungi than to other things: there was no difference between them, white, small-rooted, and their lips were inverted, and they were split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
Therefore I cut them, and found in one about eighteen ounces in weight and in the other about six ounces. And the operation in cutting them is that you should consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelil is white, moist, with a slender root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be in your presence in the fire.
For very often much blood is expelled at its section: therefore hasten if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
But if you see the patient fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a properly made lead thread, and bind the thelil with it: the method of which we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead binding.
Therefore do not cease to bind with lead, as often as it presses on the thelil, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without labor.
But if the thelil has a thick root, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread: especially that which is in the belly.
Nevertheless, it is possible to incise half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it, until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to incise a thelil which is brown in color, insensitive, foul in appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I shall return to a discussion of cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of an umbilical hernia.
Chapter 52.
An umbilical hernia arises from many causes.
Or from fissures of the fascia which is over the abdomen; and from it protrudes fat or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as has been stated before.
Or from wind constricted there.
But if it is because of a fissure of the fascia and the protrusion of fat, then its color is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in various locations.
And if it is because of the protrusion of the intestine, then its location, with what we have narrated, is of more significant variation.
Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and vehement labor.
If however it is because of humidity, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor constricted, nor is anything added.
But if it is because of blood, then with these signs a swelling appears tending towards blackness.
But if it is because of a growth of flesh: then it is a serious, large, hard swelling, and is fixed to a single quantity.
But if it is because of wind, then its touch is soft. And the operation in that is, that you consider then if the swelling of the navel is because of the blood of an artery, or vein, or wind: then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment.
For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings because of an artery and a vein.
But if the swelling of the navel is because of the intestine, or a hernia: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient so that he holds his breath, and stands erect.
Then mark with a cautery around the whole navel.
Afterwards instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then surround with a broad spatula around the navel over the place which you marked with a cautery.
Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook.
Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a silk cord, a firm ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature.
If therefore you find it already caught by the ligature: then pull it out, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and incise its superfluity.
But if an artery or vein is opposed to you, then surround it much.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then bind the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls by itself: or incise it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
But if the prominence of the navel is of raw flesh in it, or of humidity: then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we said.
And extract the blood, or humidity, which you find in it.
Then treat it with that which solidifies the place.
Concerning the treatment of cancer. Chapter 53.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it: nor have I seen another before me who has arrived at that.
And the operation in it, when it is situated as we have said, is that you should precede, and loosen the diseased part from the black bile sometimes.
Then bleed him if you find him with manifest repletion.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation, in which he is placed with the operation.
Then throw hooks into the cancer which are suitable for it.
Afterwards hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it away quickly, but rather press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever is possible there of instruments.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54.
We have already narrated in the division the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone; and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanites; nor in the case of hyposarca completely, for that is deadly.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not helped, then consider.
For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or has another illness besides dropsy, such as if he has a cough, or diarrhea, and things like that, then beware of treating him with iron, because that is dangerous.
But if you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the method of operation in him is that you raise the standing patient between your hands, and an assistant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form.
Let it have two sharp points, long, the sharp end like a spatula.
However, let there be a certain shortness in it gradually, so that you do not go through with it during the operation as far as the intestine, and injure it.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubis.
If, however, the generation of dropsy is due to illness of the liver: then let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce the whole skin with an instrument.
Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin and the fat, as if you are flaying it: and let the amount that is flayed be the size of a nail, or thereabouts.
Then pierce the fat, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water.
Then extract it, and insert into the hole an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which at its lower part has a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is incised, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the patient dies through the resolution of his animal spirit: or a syncope happens to him which approaches death.
Truly evacuate from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the patient's conditions signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from the goodness of it.
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
That is, because it is immediately retained because of the skin which retains the hole which is over the sifac: of which I have spoken, that you may perforate it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the patient tolerate it: and also remove a small quantity of water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains of the water only a little.
But if you are anxious about the patient, and you leave a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him suffer thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after the extraction of the water: according to what I have related in what preceded.
Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter 55. When an infant comes forth from the womb of its mother, and the orifice of its penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately upon birth with a very fine spatula, in this manner.
Then place a fine lead nail in the opening and bind it: and keep it there for three or four days.
When therefore he wishes to urinate, let it be removed, and he will urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured.
That is because, of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: wherefore he cannot urinate forwards, until he raises his penis with his hand upwards. Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in this case is that the patient is laid on his back.
Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and incise the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp point, or a sharp scalpel: like the incision of a reed, or like you shave something, so that its middle comes similar to the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as is necessary.
And beware in your operation of a flow of blood.
For that often happens.
Therefore apply to it that which stops blood, and care for the wound until it is healed.
Concerning Albucasis, what happens in the prepuce and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These things often happen to the penis according to Albucasis, and it is a protrusion of foul flesh.
And of it, some is malignant, and some is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one ought to be suspended with a thin hook, and cut it away until you cleanse it entirely.
Then place upon it a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with diafinicon ointment, until it is healed.
But if the Albucasis is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary that you apply a cautery to it after its incision and shaving.
But if the Albucasis is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the Albucasis is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary that you remove the Albucasis which is inside first, until when it is consolidated, then treat it externally: because when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And now blackness and corruption also happen in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, it is necessary that you excavate all that which is already blackened, and that which wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then spread over it afterwards with honey which has been mixed with the flour of pomegranate rinds and sifted, crushed herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood happens, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary that you insert into the passage of the penis a small tube of lead, so that the sick man may urinate over it.
In the adhesion, however, of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound, or abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
But if it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
That is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated because of its thinness quickly.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then it should be treated with astringent wine, until it is consolidated. Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the cure of an error happening to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation, and a lighter way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
That is, because I have found the majority of practitioners and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery, and ligature with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed I have already tried all these methods, and I have not found better than cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Because the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to be incised to cut the other, and future pain.
And with cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a finger-shaped tool which is used by surgeons, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
Moreover, in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes, and spoils your operation: and indeed a boy's skin is short by nature, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen this.
However, cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread has revealed a good method to me: because scissors are proportional in incision; therefore, because the sharpness which is above, is like the sharpness which is below.
Therefore when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and a compression is made with a similar figure, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no mistake falls at all.
And the method of the proper operation is, that you cause the boy to be aware, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you do nothing except that you tie a thread around his penis only: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him joyful and merry in every way that is possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Then insert your hand to his penis, and inflate the skin, and draw it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it from the filth that gathers there.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower down. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature firmly, and incise between the two ligatures.
Then raise the skin quickly upwards and pull out the head of the rod.
Then allow the blood to flow gradually (for this is better) and apply powder on top; and over the powder a cloth in which the yolk of a hard-boiled egg has been spread, beaten with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on until the next day: and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Now the shape of the forceps for cleaning is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them meet: lest a point of the nail project from them: and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
The error that occurs in cleaning is that perhaps the whole inner skin, or part of it, escapes at the incision. Therefore it is necessary that you extend it with your nail before the suppuration of the place: and incise it evenly.
But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then draw it out with a hook, and incise it.
But if three days pass, and what is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it until the hot abscess settles, and flay it easily, and incise it as prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
For that will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we have recounted in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised through the skin beyond measure, and reaches the upper parts, that also does not harm it.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Chapter 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things among those which we have mentioned in the divisions of treatment.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be bent over on his knees.
Then his feet are placed upon his back, and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient holds his breath as much as possible.
Therefore, the stone is forced with the neck of the bladder towards the posterior, wherefore the urine is released.
But if it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in the slenderness of a ray, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: to which there is a slender tube at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and you tie wool, or lint, to its extremity with a good ligature: and you insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if anything of the wool is superfluous, truly insert it into the tube forcefully, like a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit on a seat, and rub the bladder, and its neck with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the neck easily, until it reaches the root of the neck.
Then double it upwards from the part of the navel. Then push the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has already reached the empty thing: and this is not done according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter 59.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave space, in which is that which impels, should be according to the quantity which fills it without addition, until when something is drawn out with it, the moisture is drawn out: and when it is impelled, it is expelled with it to a distance: as the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in martial battles.
Therefore, when you wish to project moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which impels to the upper parts, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Then impel the moisture with that which impels it; for then the moisture arrives at the bladder immediately, so that the infirm person feels it. The form of a slender clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are rolled up. Then gather the circle, as an *alsofratu* is gathered; after you put into it what you want of moistures, oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder, by squeezing it with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of a stone.
Chapter LX. We have already spoken in the division of the kinds of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have spoken of the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of all that: and I have spoken of the stone in which operation with the hand and incision falls: and it is the stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am narrating that with manifest exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety: and white sand appears in it, and the sick man rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often it hangs down. Then it is raised, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the healing of children is easy, until they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in old men.
But in young men it is moderate, in that which is between that: and the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the care of it is the opposite.
Therefore, when we arrive at the treatment, it is necessary first that we cleanse the patient with a clyster, which draws out all the excrement that is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone upon examination. Then let the patient be taken with his feet up, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or rise from a high place sometimes.
Then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a full-grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and impel it outwards towards the place, of which you wish the incision: and instruct the assistant, that he press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant, that he extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, that he remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part from the place where is the incision.
Then insert the cutting spatula, whose form is this.
And cut in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the quantity that the exit of the stone from it may be not greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know that of a stone which has angles and edges, therefore its exit is made difficult on account of that.
And from that which is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is made easy.
Therefore to that which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
If therefore it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you operate on it: or tie it with a suitably made bandage, whose extremity is like the moon, which binds the stone, and does not slip from it: or that you introduce under it a slender instrument, of curved extremity.
But if you cannot operate on it, then enlarge the opening a little.
But if something of the blood overcomes you, cut it away with a scalpel.
If however the stone is more than one, then first push the largest towards the opening of the bladder.
Then incise upon it.
Afterwards push the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut upon it with a large incision.
Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or continuous urinary dripping happens to him; because the place does not completely consolidate.
Truly administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or contrive its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piecemeal.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with incense, and aloes, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place upon it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess may settle.
Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you have loosened it, moisten the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and corrosions, and things like that: as if blood were congealed in the bladder, and urine were prevented from exiting it: and this is known from the passage of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply to every species with that which is suitable for healing, until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire healing process to bind the two hips together, and to bring them together, because of the medicines which are placed on the area.
But if the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prevented: then treat it with what I relate before you arrive at incision.
For many times you will be excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it. And it is so that you take a perforator of tempered iron, which has this form, a triangular point, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie with it the catheter below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the catheter easily, until the perforator arrives at the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually: and try its perforation, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the catheter.
For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the catheter itself between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
And the ligature of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other ligature from above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you lift the skin upwards, so that it returns to its place at your completion, and covers the wound, as we have said.
Concerning the extraction of a woman's stone.
Chapter LXI.
A stone is rarely generated in women.
But if a stone should happen to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for many reasons.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And a second is, because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or one of those having husbands.
A third is, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially in operating with the hand.
And a fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity compels to that, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
If however you deprive her of that, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a well-taught midwife skilled in women's matters, or a woman who has some skill in this art: therefore make her present, and especially so that she may do all that you prescribe to her from the examination concerning the stone. First, what is it, that she should see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should compress it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the sick woman, and investigate concerning the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the greatest of her strength, until she arrives with it at the root of the hip.
Then she should cut upon it at the meeting of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whichever part it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, compressing under it: and the incision should be small at first.
Then she should insert a surgical instrument  over that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone exits from it.
And know that the types of stones are many. For among them there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its types, so that this may be signified to you concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in place of the zegi, something crushed, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Perhaps therefore the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood is settled after days, and the place is putrefied, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
Concerning the incision for watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery hernia is nothing but an aggregation of moisture in the white sheath which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg; and it is called a sheath. And sometimes it is in its own tunic, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is corrupted: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sheath, which we have mentioned: and this does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color inclines to yellow, or it is red and bloody, or fecal and black, or it is white and watery, and this is what is most common.
For if it is in the white fat which we have mentioned, then the abscess is roundish, somewhat long like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own proper tunic, then the abscess is round like part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fat, then it falls under the sense of touch.
When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form has preceded.
According to that therefore which comes forth in the track of the inserted instrument, judge concerning that which is between.
When therefore we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then he is to lie on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Then you sit on his left, and order the assistant to sit on his right, who should extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the scrotum, and to the part of the mirach of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the scrotum in the middle lengthwise, almost to the pubis: and let the incision be made according to the straightness of a line equidistant from the line which divides the skin of the scrotum, until it reaches the white membrane which contains it: and flay it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your flaying, by which you flay it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly search with the flaying according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then perforate the membrane full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the membrane upwards, and do not touch the skin of the scrotum containing it: and incise the membrane however it is possible for you to incise it, either wholly, or piecemeal, especially its thin side.
For if you do not exquisitely search, in its incision there is no security, lest the water return.
But if the egg proceeds outwardly from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the membrane, return it.
Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the scrotum with a suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you find the egg corrupted by blackness or something else, then it is necessary that you ligate the vessels which are its suspensory ligament, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut away the testicle with its suspensory ligament, and extract the egg: afterwards treat it with what we have said.
But if water has collected in two parts, then know that there are two roots: therefore cut the other part as you did the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that there is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the scrotum: and place on top folded cloths, which are bolsters: and bind them on top with a bandage which has six according to this form.
Then two cloths are taken, and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends by which it is pressed be made of tow, or wet wool: and let them be gathered with a tightening in the loin-cloths: and one end should reach over the anus to the back, and the second should reach to the part of the groin: and two ends below over the two hips, and two other ends over the two groins, and let the whole tightening be gathered in the loin-cloths.
And sometimes this root is treated artificially with a cautery in place of incision with iron: and it is, that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is ignited, as we have narrated: until when the white sifac containing water is uncovered: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to a Greek letter.
Then perforate that sifac with it, and it is ignited, until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a thin, ignited cautery, and incise it as much as is possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further removed from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
But if a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else opposes you during the incision, or during the cauterization: then it is necessary that you cure what opposes you from it with the treatment that is suitable for it, according to what has been previously stated.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not await this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I relate it: and it is.
When it is confirmed to you by what we have said about the signs, that the abscess is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a pledget over the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may run out: then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the egress of water at the time when you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane opposes the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of the water, then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsical patients is extracted, whose form precedes; or add a little in the operation of the wound.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or thereabouts.
When therefore it collects, then let it be perforated in the same way, and the sick person will pass his days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the incision upon this fistula, there is fear leading to destruction in many conditions.
Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from it.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely. Either from an acute or acrid superfluity which is poured out to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens from a knotting and swelling of the arteries, as its mention has already preceded: or from a swelling of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from them [i.e., the swellings] from the inflation of the arteries, is known by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
That however which happens from the swelling of the veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with the fingers. And now it is possible that an incision be made upon this type, and upon the remaining flesh: and it is so, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with the white sifach: and free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, and ligate the vessels: and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from every part of the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those innate meats, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg, and incise it. And if there is adhesion between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and extract the egg, as we have said. When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Ramices, which is with the Vitex.
Chapter LXIV.
A vitex is an abscess wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and difficult movement and exercise, and walking, result for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of the remembrance of that which preceded it.
Truly it is necessary that we speak of the operation in it according to what the first ones did. Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula, with a transverse incision in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are uncovered.
Then flay from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the foul, corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall away.
For there is no harm through it.
But if a vein affects all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted with the vessels: lest the egg be deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and waste away, or dry up, and there be no help with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal fistula. Chapter 65.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Is that it happens gradually over a long time, and it does not happen suddenly: and it is an equal abscess towards the deep; therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes a vehement pain suddenly from its beginning: and it is a diverse abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes zirbum exits with the intestine: and this is called intestinal Ramex, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes excrement runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and with it is the destruction of the infirm; because it causes a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this illness with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is, that you instruct the infirm, that he may reduce the intestine with his hand to the interior of its concavity, if it obeys return.
Then he is to be laid supine upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin to the superiors, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely lengthwise.
Then fix in the two lips of the section hooks, according to what you need to open the section with them: and the section should be such a quantity, that it is possible for the egg to come out of it.
Then flay the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphak is uncovered, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second siphak, and absolutely loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with the right hand to the interior the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white siphak upwards, with the left hand: and raise the egg with the siphak to the part of the section: and instruct the assistant, that he extend the egg upwards: and you loosen the adhesion, which is behind, the solution being complete.
And search with your fingers, so that there is nothing there of the intestine involved in the hard white siphak.
But if you find something of it: then push it down to the belly below.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it near the last siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the section: then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over some with a figure which is in the manner of a cross: and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles a strong ligament, until nothing can from the vessels, which nourish them send to them anything: so that there does not happen from it a hot abscess.
And place again a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers distant from it.
And after these two ligatures leave of the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut all the rest according to the roundness, and remove from it the egg.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles a section, from which blood and pus runs: as we have narrated in that which was premised.
Then apply wool submerged in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the ligature which we have narrated.
And sometimes the white siphak which we have spoken of is cauterized, after its incision fearing a flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be moistened with warm water: and place upon it that which we have spoken of, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning a cupping instrument with a nozzle.
Chapter 66.
In this nozzle I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have narrated in the nozzle which is with a tube.
That is, to tie the vessels after the incision above it with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groins.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all hours: truly if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And this happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said.
That is, because the sifach is extended: then it softens, and the place is inflamed, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its account preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick man lies on his back between your hands.
Then cut the place of the rupture of the abscesses and the protruding part, with a cut across, to the amount of three fingers.
Then constrict the alsifak and what are under the skin, until when the white sifach is uncovered, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a ray, and place it on the prominent place of the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two prominent places on the end of the ray from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture: then withdraw the end of the ray.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal fistulas. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Therefore, when you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the sisach contracts, and no prominence is added to the rupture.
And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its cure, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and incise all the skin which is softened upon the natural skin. Then bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, sew first the superfluity of the softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make the suture firm.
Then treat it with the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter 69.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law; and on account of that it would be permitted to me not to mention it in this my book; and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he may know the treatment of him to whom it has happened.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit thereby, such as rams, he-goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and incision.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear to the touch.
In castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition; because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
Concerning the care of a hermaphrodite, in two ways.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite from men is according to two ways.
One of them is that which appears in what follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one species, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubis like very small male testicles, protruding outwardly: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three types, two from men, and one type from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second type of men, however, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Concerning the incision of the frenulum, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXI.
The frenulum is perhaps added to the natural thing, until it is disfigured and its appearance becomes foul; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it is spread out like in men, and reaches to coitus.
Therefore, you should hold the excess of the frenulum with your hand or with a hook, and incise it; and do not go too far in the incision, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
The flesh, however, which arises, is flesh which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it comes out externally in the likeness of a tail; and because of that some early authorities call the ailment tailed.
Therefore, it is necessary that we incise it just as we incise the frenulum, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the Alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, the imperforate vulva of a woman, or it has a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from a preceding illness: and indeed it is made either from added, naturally occurring flesh, or from a thin membrane, or a thick one: and it occurs either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And the knowledge of it is made by the inspection of the midwife, if the obstruction is apparently close.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane, and it is close to the two labia: then hasten, and break it.
And it is so, that you place small cushions on the two labia.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Then extend the two labia with force, until the thin membrane is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman have intercourse every day, so that the place does not consolidate in another way.
But if the membrane is thick, dense, then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and incise it: and let there be with you medicines which staunch the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense aggregated with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not quickly consolidate, hold it for several days: and administer a pledget of dry linen, then let the rest be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes a birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be incised in this manner: while it is not a cancerous abscess, for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, contrariety with iron should absolutely not be done.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubeae in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the orifices of veins, until much blood flows from them continually.
When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become athelil: and I have already spoken in the division of their species, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the sense: then there is no treatment for it with iron.
But those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which sensation falls, are those which are treated.
Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Then extend the hemorrhoids with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Then pulverize upon them at the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without mastication: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and things similar to them.
Then let him push her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
But if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and galls, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it upon her back.
If therefore blood is cut off with it, it is good: and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarthith, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth however is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of rough appearance.
It is necessary therefore that you incise what appears of it, according to what I said in thelil equally: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the exit which happens in the womb.
Chapter 74.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and a stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And I indeed have already described all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I describe in this treatise a hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is of the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if a sense falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps with maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which surpasses two seats, and she is reclined, or she is laid on her back, and she brings her feet to the lower part of her belly: and her hips are spread, and she places her arms under her knees, and binds each with a suitable ligature to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those which are after.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with a rod the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak woman.
But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions on the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented: and it is necessary that he places the handle, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and that the attendant revolves the handle, until the depth of the womb is opened.
Therefore, when the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a linen cloth submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is a certain styptic quality: and place the linen cloth, and extract the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally on the womb, and on the pubis, clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is clysterized with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily, or long birthwort has been boiled: then it returns to the ointment.
But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from its treatment with iron, rather treat it with that which we have said in the division.
On the teaching of obstetricians, how live embryos, having emerged according to a non-natural figure, are treated.
Chapter 77.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the form of natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman compressed in her lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and that which is upon her of the birth is lightened, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned about on its neck, and similar things among blameworthy forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, skillful in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and what its nature is, and is signified by it, and stands upon it.
When the fetus exits head first in its natural way, and this becomes strenuous for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and steam her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and break the secundine with it, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it of moisture flows: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the clyster, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze with sneezing powder, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will exit immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you gently reduce them little by little.
But if it does not yield upon entry, then place the woman on a seat and raise her feet upward; then shake the seat upon the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with a cloth and pull it out evenly, for it will come out.
The exit of the embryo on its feet.
When the fetus comes out on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward straighten it.
Then let him take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When therefore they come out as far as the hips, then instruct him that it be compressed, and make her sneeze with sneezing powders; for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have recounted, then return the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form.
For then it will come out easily.
But if it is prevented with all that we have recounted, then take some marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and beat everything well in a mortar; then anoint the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen with it.
Then make her sit in warm water until the hypochondria are reached.
Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make a pessary for her from myrrh and insert it.
When therefore the pessary has been in place for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze; and hold her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of the abdomen with gentle pressure.
For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands.
When it comes out in this manner, then he will succeed in inserting his hands gradually.
Then the woman will be laid back on her neck, and her feet will hang downwards; and she will be lying on the bed, and will clasp her hands.
Then press gradually on her belly.
Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows, until she is prepared in the lower part.
But if the fetus does not come out, then take its feet and move them with a strong movement.
Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Then let him insert his hands and equalize the fetus gradually; and instruct the woman to bear down, until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
He will contrive in the reduction of his hand.
But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman, and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
But if childbirth receives her, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive at the reduction of the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with its hands outstretched, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually rotate it, and adjust it easily.
When therefore it is adjusted, then place on her vulva that which we have narrated from oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean to her right side.
Then instruct her to bear down; and make her sneeze with sneezing powders.
The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your nail until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place it as is necessary: and instruct the woman to bear down several times: for it itself will come out with easy exit.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four are born.
However, that is unusual, and rarely happens.
Five, however, is outside of nature, and they do not fully live: and one afterbirth contains them, however many they are: and they are separated by a septum, distinguishing between them, attached to the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they exit as one fetus exits by a natural, easy exit: and they exit by a blameworthy exit, as we have narrated. But if some of them are difficult at birth, and arrive at that which we have spoken of from unnatural positions, then treat them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with speed and slowness, and let her contrive according to every position with that which is prepared for her from skill leading to health.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has already been verified by me, that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of midwives. For perhaps something similar to that will come to her: therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have mentioned in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on the bed, on her back, and her head be inclined lower, and her legs raised: and a helper hold her on both sides, or she be tied to the bed, so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow, fenugreek, and linseed mucilage. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her insert it into the womb with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix hooks on the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend head first: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is on its feet, then in its pubis, and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and put its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until it reaches an empty space.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every part, so that its exit is eased: just as is done with a tooth at its extraction.
And it is necessary that that which is between them be softened, so that the extension is eased.
But if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may revolve with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be moved to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand comes out before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then draw it out until, when it comes out whole, you cut it either at the joint of the sole, or at the elbow; and so you must do with the other hand and with the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that he insert a spiny spatula between the fingers, and split the head with it, and draw out the water; or break it up with the instrument which is called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similarly, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary that you cut it with algengematu; or draw it out with misdach, as we have said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
But if the head comes out and is constricted at the fork, then let it be split until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not entangled, nor does it yield to exit, then cut the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
But if there is an abscess in the lower part of the belly, or if there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary that you pierce it until the moisture runs out of it.
If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand, and split the belly or chest until that which is in them runs out.
But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head remains, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand into the depth of the womb, and with it search for the head, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot abscess which happens to it, then it is not necessary that one labor over it; rather it is necessary then to administer the pouring of humid, oily things; and apply plasters; and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it is straightened; then let that which we said about a living fetus be administered.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piecemeal, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave absolutely nothing of the afterbirth inside.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which happen in the wombs.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then let her descend into astringent waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And indeed I myself saw a woman in whose womb a fetus had died; then she was impregnated over it a second time, afterwards another fetus also died.
Therefore, after a long time an abscess happened to her in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore I was called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out of the place.
Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Therefore I was amazed at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I examined the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and now she lived in such a way for a long time, and emitted a little pus from the place.
And I did not establish this extraneous thing here, except because there is knowledge in it, and help for that which a skillful physician administers with his hand in the treatment.
Concerning the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of a constrictor, by which books are bound, to which are equally two whirligigs at the two extremities of two pieces of wood.
However, this whirligig ought to be more slender than the constrictor; and it ought to be made either of ebony or of boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it is opened with them when you revolve the two whirligigs.
The form of the whirligig by which the matrix is opened.
Another form similar to that, more slender, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her legs hanging down, and that which is between her legs open.
Then insert those two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her hips.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of another kind of turning which the ancients called the impelling form by which the fetus is impelled.
The form of the Almisdac by which a small head is crushed. The form of a hook having one point.
The form of a hook having two points.
The form of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
The form of two broad spatulas also.
All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the more highly regarded among men because of their quantity.
Therefore you should not despise any of these instruments, but let them be prepared for you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the secundines.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the secundines are retained after childbirth, then you ought to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it comes out by this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs which open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and sage, and cassia lignea, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will come out easily.
But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or mallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she has found it, then let her take it and gently extend it.
But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and extract it gradually according to the straightness, so that the womb does not fall with forceful pulling: rather, it is necessary that it be moved easily to the right and left sides: then let the amount of pulling be increased.
For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing and with herbal fumigations.
But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself in repeated attempts at extraction.
Truly it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the woman's hip.
Then give her an enema with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak woman.
Therefore, suitable fumigations ought to be administered to it.
Certain of the ancients, however, have already tested the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated in the retention of the secundines and menses.
Let it be made from a glass similar to an alcamach, or from brass; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed upon the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
Concerning the cure of an imperforate anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many boys are born, and their anuses are imperforate, which a subtle membrane has already obstructed.
Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil upon it.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
And now there occurs an obstruction of the anus also from the healing of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said of treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Chapter LXXX.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part, are a knotting, and a thickening which occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
When therefore that knotting becomes old, it opens, and a watery white moisture, or thin pus, flows from it.
And sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And there are fistulas among them which, when they are in the space, penetrate as far as the bladder, and as far as the urinary passage.
And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint, and as far as the coccyx.
However, that by which a fistula penetrating to the anus is distinguished from one that does not penetrate is that you insert your index finger into the anus: and you insert a thin probe into the fistula made of air or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
But if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything proceed from the opening from excretion, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the cure.
And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus: then its sign is the exit of urine from it, and the prevention of its consolidation by medicines in this place.
If however it penetrates to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone: and the finding of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always exits from it: and that medication is not effective in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and their cure is labor and vanity for the foolish physician on whom it is performed. In that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw: according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven: and it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back: and you raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
Therefore if you feel the probe has already penetrated by itself, detected by your finger, besides what you feel between your finger and the fistula itself, or the flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
They have said, however, that the flesh is healed in some men, and of the medication by which help is hoped for it, it is to heat a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, as preceded, and to insert it burning into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat it twice or thrice, until you know that all those added filtered fleshes, which are like the quill of a bird's feather, are now cauterized.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those cauterized fleshes come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it is never healed with any other treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or fat, and you see a fistula in that which follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered fleshes, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing of them remains.
But if blood overcomes you, and dissolves [the tissue] between you and your operation so that you cut those fleshes: then it is better, and of speedier help, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire brings together good habits, the burning of those added fleshes, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of humors.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, or crushed cabbage leaves, until the place discharges pus, and those burned fleshes come out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, generating firm flesh: and there are medicines in which there are stypticity and drying.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you do not fear a recurrence. But if a fistula has already reached the depths of the anus, and is lengthened by the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a probe, and between you and it is a membrane of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is administered to it: either to cauterize it, as we have said; or to excise it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to introduce lint, and cure from nearby.
And do not proceed far with the incision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and there happens to the infirm an involuntary evacuation. Then cure it with what we have said. For perhaps it will heal; or you will lengthen that membrane, and cleanse it after you have cut it almost to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues which are in the incision, as far as you can with exploration.
Then attempt the restoration of the whole wound with a suture, and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes a fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is in the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe of perforated extremity, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, of those preparing leathers, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and around them.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its depth.
If therefore it penetrates internally near the margin of the anus, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together: and tighten each, and leave it for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshes which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall away: then treat the wound, until it is consolidated, and healed.
For it is not for you to do that because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatulite with a spine by which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
There are hemorrhoids according to two methods.
Either they are within the anus, similar to bladders of coals, or prunes; or as if they themselves are grape seeds.
And of them there are small ones, and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus, are according to the majority few in moisture, from which flows a clear water, or a little blood with a constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you order the patient to strain; and it is pressed out, until it exits the anus, and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend them with hooks; or hold them with your fingernail.
Then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and softening: then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a pledget of woolen cloth, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then incise them, and sprinkle upon them after incision certain warm powders, that they may stand in place of cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if the anus does not obey evacuation, then give the patient an enema in which there is a small amount of irritant, so that what is in the anus may be washed out with it, and obey evacuation quickly, when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is so that you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and incise them.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever dislikes incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Take a wound-up thread, and insert it into a needle.
Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong constriction.
Then knot the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor should you sew it, so that the excess of blood may flow from it.
Then place on the anus a cloth infused in rose oil, or cerate, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments, and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures.
For they often happen from the drying of the stool, and the constriction of nature.
Therefore, when they become old, and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents their healing is removed from them.
Then treat them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal, then repeat the process with greater force than the first time, until they bleed much and are excoriated; then treat them until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and dry athelil, and formica.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, there is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence on the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to extend the athelil and incise it; or to tie it tightly with silk thread or hair until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously explained with fire or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted and non-inverted athelil are eradicated with the instrument that I shall describe. An ant, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going very deep; and when cold finds it, something like the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs throughout the body; and it occurs most often in the hands.
And its treatment is to take a small tube from a goose quill or a strong vulture quill; and place that tube over the ant until the circle of the tube contains some of it.
Then rotate your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant; and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root. And if you wish, do it with a tube of bronze or iron, according to this method.
Let the top of the tube be drawn upwards into a rolled-up, blunt point, so that its grip and rotation on the finger may be eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant as was previously described in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for loosening the bowels, and for colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast or hammered bronze.
And sometimes this instrument is made small, and sometimes large, according to those in whom it is administered.
Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and so also should the enemas of those whose anuses are weak or painful.
A large clyster.
A small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner: and it should have a division so that the bag may be tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a point: and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the fingers, and a little thicker, and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be made of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be in the shape of a small asofrat, the root of which is one palm.
When therefore the bag is placed in it, let it be tightly bound at the head of the clyster between the two divisions with a strong binding.
Then use it as a clyster.
And this is the form of the bag here depicted, and of the holes. The method of using it as a clyster is: to fill the bag or bladder with medicine which is warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and beware lest it be very hot or very cold.
Then let the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs upwards; and place beneath him a mat, that is, a leather on which people lie, or a cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or the like.
Then introduce it into the anus gently.
Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until he has emptied all that is in the clyster into the intestine. Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall. If the medicine compels him to defecate, then let him hold it back as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more effective in helping.
But if you give him a clyster for looseness of the bowels, and his evacuation is rapid, then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
But if there are haemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very subtle, gentle, of the kind used for children.
And this is the form of a subtle clyster over which the skin is stretched tight.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division concerning the treatment of wounds which was suitable for the book, and I shall here speak of their treatment by hand and with medicines according to the completion.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore the things by which wounds are made are very many, such as the throw of a stone, or the incision of a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance or a stick or an arrow, and similar things from many objects.
Moreover, wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head or neck or chest or belly or liver, and similar members.
And I am relating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may establish its reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I shall begin with simple head wounds, because the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound happens in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and has now broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear concerning the unhealthy outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately bleed the cephalic vein: and do not delay this: and draw out blood from him according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing is prohibiting bloodletting, especially if the blood which flows from the wound is little.
And let the bloodletting be from the part opposite the wounded part.
And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
But if something prohibits bloodletting, then let him lessen his food, and not approach meats, nor wines.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess happens to it, a compress soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
But if you are secure from a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall relate shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by themselves, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I shall relate in the wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
But if the wound is already bared from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then incise it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as are heads [of grain], and cooked wheat, until it is like pottage: and similar things.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise all the putrefied part, and cast it away: then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
Therefore if you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it.
But if necessity demands when that which we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
Method of incarnative powder.
Take one part frankincense, and two parts dragon’s blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: let the whole be ground very finely and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with lint, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it may not fester.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If, however, a wound happens in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a wound of the head when it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done except to avoid treating it with something that produces strong astringency, such as ziniar and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm nerves and constrict them.
And do not put anything cold whatsoever on the wound; because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is the most superior of the members; and let that which heals it be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutia, when washed also with fresh water: and the other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer a suture; or draw together its edges with powders.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus has already gathered, then perforate it in the lowest point in it.
But if an artery has already been cut in the wound, and a flow of its blood has followed: then separate, or cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole, have been injured, and the al-hawāḍigī have been saved: then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the throat cane, and do not touch the throat, but rather level it, and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments which have astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
But if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it, until the wound becomes putrid, and it is separated and its discharge is lessened.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described.
But if bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that whose mention came in its chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
Therefore if air escapes from the wound when the sick man breathes, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood, then do not at first apply powder, nor bind it, lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick man; but apply an attractive ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
If, however, you do not have ointment, then place old linen in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what comes out of it in the form of moisture; and cause the sick man to lie on the wound so that what collects there may flow out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the patient has not suffered a spasm, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor tightness of breath, and you see his other conditions to be good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore treat it with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it always opens again, then know that a fistula has formed.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and fragments have fallen from it: then explore the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction is then easier.
The judgment in the treatment of other accidental wounds in the other members is the judgment which we have described.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their exit.
Chapter LXXXVII.
The rupture which happens to the abdomen is great, moderate, and small.
Therefore from a great one sometimes an intestine, or a number of intestines, protrudes.
Therefore their replacement and their suture is more forceful and more difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
It follows therefore that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten in their replacement to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore on account of this, the middle disruption of disruptions is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine does not become difficult, as it becomes difficult in these two kinds.
Know that the suture of the vein is according to four methods.
Two common sutures agree in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly communicate to the other wounds.
However, they are more proper with the suture of the belly: and I relate to you each one with exposition and explanation. Therefore I say that when a wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a cloth moistened in tepid water alone.
Or boil in water squills, and cyperus, and spica, and bathe the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does this: and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow, or mallow has been boiled.
For by that its entry is eased with a small thing.
But if its return is excused after this treatment, then incise a little in the disruption, with the instrument with which haemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than incision: and compulsion to incise is not done after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part of it not sharp, and let the thin end not be with the thinness of a spatula, but rather be a little blunter: and it is that which is similar to a cautery, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible upon that: because it is better.
But when the disruption is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick man lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium wounds.
But in small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then cause a devout assistant to be present between your hands, who holds the whole disruption with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it for him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of a single common suture.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound.
Then leave from the end of the disruption the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix a needle except that you insert into it thread at two ends of the skin, with two ends of the sifac which is under the skin from the insides, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you have now joined together two ends of the skin, and two ends of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with double thread around the needle several times from the two parts together, until the two lips of the wound are joined together with decent joining.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix in them another needle: afterwards draw it back with thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because thin needles very quickly cut the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: on account of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two extremities of the skin that are very close: lest the flesh be cut quickly, and the wound be opened before its consolidation, and they not be lengthened also with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the point of the needles, so that they do not injure the sick person in their sleep: and put on them little cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the points of the needles: and leave them, until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And indeed this kind of suture with needles is thus more suitable in small wounds.
Because one needle, or two, or about that many suffice in their suture.
But the second suture is common, so that you bring together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia at one time, with a needle in which is wound thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, return the needle from the part from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is, like the seam of a cloth by which cloths are sewn, and put between each suture the amount of the thickness of the little finger.
But this suture is known to men.
And with this suture I sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and there came out from the intestines about two palms of the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the abdomen.
Therefore I returned it after its intestine had stood outside the wound twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, occupied in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicines, were to be found.
Therefore I applied old linen to the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
But I shall describe two kinds of suture proper to the subject.
And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle, going along the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end of the sifac on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the mirach.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this way at the same end of the mirach from the outside to the inside: and leave the end of the sifac which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration which you make it penetrate in the sifac at the end of the mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end which is of the sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out from the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the end of the sifac which is on the other side with this end of the mirach: and draw it out from the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it turn by turn, until you sew the whole outside according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you sew like the suture of leatherworkers who sew hides: so that you sew the sifac once from one side at one end of the skin: and that you leave it another time from another side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
His statement is narrated so that you sew it according to the likeness with which certain physicians sew, so that they join each part to its suitable counterpart by nature: and apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to its other end.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
It is necessary that you insert the needle into the end of the mirach nearest to you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and leave the two ends of the sifac.
Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside into the two ends of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose recollection preceded.
This is therefore also Galen's statement.
And some said.
The suture of the abdomen is straightened with two needles.
That is, to insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leathers equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
The judgment, however, of the medication of a wound, is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and adapt it: then put on incarnative powder.
But if the air has already altered the wound: then put on it certain ointments, which are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach are consolidated.
Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
But if medicines are not present to you, then put on it immediately, from the time it begins to emit pus, old lint: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
But if you fear that the wound will communicate with the principal members in the lesion, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and put it in the area around the groin, and under the armpits.
But if he feels pain, or pricking, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then clysterize him with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has become an exit penetrating to its concavity.
And know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and what is from the small intestines is of more difficult healing.
Moreover, the intestine that is called the jejunum does not admit healing from a wound that happens in it at all: and that is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is a hernia, and you obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed, and it has now become green, or black: then it is necessary that you constrict it with thread above the place which is blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not happen.
For in a hernia are veins and arteries.
Then incise what is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its traction and extraction in the case of a hernia, and the emission of pus from the wound, may be alleviated upon you.
Concerning a wound which occurs in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some men: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was made, and excretion and flatulence came forth from it.
Therefore I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the patient, that some evil accident might befall him in his belly: and no evil accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entering the bath, and exercising in his usual way.
And now some experienced men have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small: then it is necessary that it be ligated in this manner.
And it is to take ants with large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it seizes upon it, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and not come loose.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing this with ant after ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient. And now it is possible that the intestine may also be tied with a fine thread: which has been cleaned from an animal's intestine, attached to it after being put into a needle.
And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is much thinned.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it into the rupture. And this method of suture with ants and intestine, is only according to a way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except thinning, nor is its healing at all.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchamen and fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old and ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not excised: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchamen.
And a fistula indeed is, according to the truth, a filtered, hard, white knot: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And it is at certain times moist, which discharges pus.
And perhaps the moisture is split at certain times.
And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I already premised in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the paucity of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it, and above its lips is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much filth and dirt: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is discharged from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by a property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed there by nature: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that fistula occurs in all the members of the body.
For among them are fistulas which reach to the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the composite joints in their composition: such as the hand, and the foot: and among them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is according to this manner, is among the illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is among the fistulas one whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned: and you hope, and are confident in its cure, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
But if in the fistula there is tortuosity, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.
Because lead, with the softness of its body, is eased, and is bent around the tortuosity.
But if the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to investigate it with a probe.
Therefore, inject a clyster into one of its orifices.
For the moisture with which you inject it goes towards the other orifices, and flows out of them.
Then, carefully inquire in whatever way is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is far or near; or whether it is one fistula which has many orifices. And consider all this with the greatest strength of your understanding: with your questioning of the patient, and the finding of pain upon compression with your hand upon the place, and similar signs and causes incidental to an abscess.
When therefore you have considered all these things truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is that you should then consider if the fistula is near at hand and visible, or in a safe place far from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you about. Then cut the fistula according to what has been explained in my account, and remove what is in it of pus and corrupt flesh, that which grows in its orifice from flesh or callus and the like, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it as deeply as is possible for you.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then apply pledgets wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula which you have reached with the iron: do this several times with it, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it as we have described.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is ascertained by you: then investigate it, and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from doing so, such as a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
If therefore bone is detected, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which will cause it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed, and it emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore investigate it a second time, and carefully perform its scraping, and its cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, it is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then skillfully perform the extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If however something of the moist parts opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in incising them, then incise those moist parts and the flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then put something on the wound which will cause it to putrefy: and leave it until that which is around those bones of flesh and moist parts has putrefied.
And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted.
Rather, if you fear, place upon it a pledget soaked in crushed sulfur with oil: or a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those moist parts putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction will be easier.
But if it is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar bones, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then shave it with the ultimate instrument until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
But if that which is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to incise it entirely to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated. And I tell you, a thing which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may put it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a man, young in age, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became an abscess with a large abscess: and there was no external cause.
Therefore, time was extended with him through the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials came together with it.
And its treatment was postponed, until the leg was fistulated, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and the humors of the body.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one wise in the art of surgery, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which ran from those openings in great quantity: indeed, the whole man's body was now wasted, and his color was yellow.
Therefore I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg. Therefore I prepared, and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now eroded, and blackened, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I sawed what was revealed to me, and prepared [it] from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidative medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration in its operation, and section of it, was not necessary except because of the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because there happened to him at all hours from the superabundance of evacuation bad fainting spells.
Therefore he healed with a complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he was in his dispositions: and it did him no harm at all in walking.
But if a prominent bone in the place of the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligature, and bind it to the extremity of the prominent bone: and instruct someone, who extends it upwards: and place another ligature of wool thicker than the first ligature. Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you draw the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, decently under the bone below: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place a little, so that there is not corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels another sawing in its place. But if the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely.
Then place wood below.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption a little, as we said.
But if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
But if the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the sole of the foot: then the matter is very difficult in it.
Truly it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever instrument is rectified for you: when it does not oppose you, vein, or nerve.
And know that scalpels and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable to that operation.
And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art, a testimony to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find by yourself that which is suitable from the instruments for every infirmity.
The shape of the saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
This depicted saw shape, let it be decently made. Let its upper bow be made of iron sharpness, and its handle of boxwood, and let it be pyramidally and decently made.
The shape of a joint rasp.
Let the head of this rasp be according to the shape of the head of a star-headed nail; and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except that the heads of joints are rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or a bone is large and great.
The shape of a larger rasp.
The shape of a medium rasp.
The shape of a broad rasp.
The shape of a rasp in which there is a concavity.
The shape of another, fine rasp.
The shape of another rasp with a curved end.
The shape of a small, thin, slender rasp.
The shape of a rasp with which bones are cut.
Also the shape of a large rasp.
This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places on account of the bones.
The shape of a rasp which is suitable for rasping that which has been perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, of sharp points.
It is made of Indian wood.
And similarly it is necessary that all that we have spoken of be made of rasps, and incisors, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external or an internal cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the cure does not help, and you see the corruption cutting into the member, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that member until where the corruption reaches, so that the sick person may escape death through it, or the harm which is greater than the defect of the member.
And the sign that this happens is that the member blackens until it is thought that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness, until that putrefaction is incised up to what follows that member, and creeps into the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the striking of certain poisonous things: such as a sea scorpion, and viper, and a little wheel, and similar things.
If therefore the corruption or blow is in the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, that it may proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint. But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the sick person.
And to administer beyond that in treatment, is a matter of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, then incise the whole foot.
But if it ascends to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except abandonment, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the method of incising a limb, or sawing it, is to tie a ligature below what you wish to incise: and tie another ligature above the place.
And let an assistant extend one ligature downwards; and let another assistant extend the other ligature upwards.
And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then let it be incised, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides, and that the saw not touch the healthy part: and there may happen to the sick person an added injury, and a hot abscess.
But if there should happen an internal flow of blood while you operate, then cauterize the place quickly; or place upon it some powders that staunch blood.
Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable to it, and take care of it until it is healed.
And I tell you that which happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I tell you.
That is, because there happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened of himself, after he saw the corruption falling upon the limb with its vehemence, that which he found from its pain, and its burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on the hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from myself concerning the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him concerning the cutting off of his hand, death.
Because the man's strength was beyond the event.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and word came to me of him, that he had hurried, and had cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this account, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls under the kind of this sickness: and that there may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy member, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it breaks or is perforated, and what is in it of pus goes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has been thinned: and it does not arrive at the last in its corruption, nor does it impress upon bone, nor upon nerve, nor upon ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and it is not named Fistula: nevertheless if its space is prolonged until the corruption impresses upon any of these members, then it is named Fistula, or zuken.
And its cure is, that you incise all that skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like a cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin adheres, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster: and it is, that you consider the Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it is of foul odor: then clysterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is of vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, they are gathered in a vessel: and they are decocted over a fire, until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it: and bind its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the quantity of two hours.
Then draw it out by expression: do this for as many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with wood ash water, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is, that you take the ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the wood ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar is already mixed.
Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because it is of the property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine causes adherence to the sinus, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed: then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is, that you take some of the diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or clysterize him with certain other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster cannula does not enter: then widen it slightly with iron; or place in it a linen cloth rolled in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and leave of it an amount into which the clyster may enter without addition.
And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is raised to a higher position: then cut it in a lower place which is in it, so that the pus runs downwards from it: because pus, when constricted in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from growing in it.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which the pus runs out of it easily according to what is prepared for you.
Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidative medicines which are placed on the wound, suitable to that which you wish.
And spread them on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a quantity that the whole sinus is communicated with.
Then cut with scissors in a straight line with the opening of the sinus a hole, a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be eased: and do not remove the large cloth until after some days at one time.
But the one which is over the opening of the sinus, is the one which you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out: and so that you may know whether that which flows from it is much or little virus, or digested, or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the matter which comes out over the opening of the sinus, then you know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment. But if subtle virus comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are some men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are some who act contrary to that.
But if undigested pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, truly let the physicians do so, that the medicines be moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: such as diafinicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it.
And of the last things by which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle on it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with it, and use it.
And now it does something similar to this action, when you do not have diafinicon ointment present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then spread over it a cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with the honey which you have boiled, until it has thickened: and powder over it spices, and put over it a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes there is administered in it long birthwort, and the roots of the celestial lily, and there is lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Use them simple, or compound, grind them, and sift them: and powder over the honey which I have mentioned, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know that in its depth is corruption: or it now makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been premised. Concerning the treatment of whitlow and a rubbed nail, and the incision of an added finger, and section.
Chapter XCI.
Whitlow is an abscess which is born under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it is born in the other fingers.
When therefore its matter is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes brown.
When therefore you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you incise with iron all the excess which remains from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise that flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh from burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
But if the corruption already penetrates the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger, then incise it at one of the joints, according to what its previous mention prescribed.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if attrition or a blow happens to the nail, and intense pain results, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse section from above downwards.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the patient thereby, and it will be a cause for the growth of added flesh in the place.
Then treat the place with that which soothes pains.
The added finger which grows in some men's hands, perhaps is wholly fleshy; and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or its growth is in some knots of the finger.
Therefore that which grows in some knots of the finger does not move; and that which grows near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore, the cutting of that which is fleshy among them is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
But the treatment of that whose growth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore abstain from its incision.
However, in that which grows on a finger at the last joint, then it is necessary that you first cut its flesh with a round incision down to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it heals.
Now, the adhesion which happens to fingers together, often happens either from a person's birth, that is, they are born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore it is necessary that you cut that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly adhere, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
And similarly if adhesion happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that adhesion, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the member.
Concerning the incision of vitiated tissue.
Chapter 92.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many members of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and carry burdens.
Therefore it is necessary that you administer shaking of the body from black bile, sometimes with strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient in the basilic vein.
However, their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out.
And the other method is that the vein is raised, and the whole thing is drawn out.
Its incision, however, is according to this method.
First bathe the leg with much warm water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the vein downwards until a quantity of blood comes out that you see is sufficient, and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Afterwards, bind it and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
Its elevation is in this manner.
Shave the patient's leg if there is much hair on it.
Then put him in a bath; or rub his leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins swell; or let him perform vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the skin in a line with the vein lengthwise; or at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and uncover the vein on all sides until it is visible; and when it appears, you will see it is red tending towards blackness.
When it is removed from the skin, you see it white, like a cord.
Then insert a spatula under it until it is raised and comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers apart.
Then uncover the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then lift it with spatulas as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Then lift it, and incise it with the last incision at the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you pull it out from the incision which is higher, or higher than all the incisions, until when it comes out entirely: then incise it.
But if it does not obey you to be pulled out and lifted: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it, and turn your hand in every direction until it comes out.
And beware lest it be incised.
For if it is incised, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm from it enters upon the patient.
Therefore, when you have pulled it out entirely: then place on the place of the wounds wool submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it is healed.
But if the vine is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a twisting to the parts, and it is not as we have said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you incise it in every part of its tortuosity, and the places of its twisting.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift it entirely: and beware at your incision upon it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to lift, or pull it out.
Therefore, preserve your prudence.
The form of the incision by which the vine is healed.
The form of a blind hook.
It does not have a curve like the other hooks, nor is it sharp-ended, so that it does not wound a vein: and it is of thick, gentle curvature: because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed let it have superfluous thickness, as we have said.
On the extraction of a vein from the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, of little softness, that is, in which grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation indeed is from putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh, happen within bodies.
And a sign of the beginning of this vein's event is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg.
Then the place is blistered.
Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blister, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one keil drachm up to two drachms, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
As often therefore as something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap it in lead, and tie it.
If it is prolonged much, then cut part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
And do not cut it out by the roots before it comes out completely.
Because if you cut it, it contracts, and enters into the flesh: and causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be gently treated, and drawn out little by little, until it comes out completely, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed there comes out in some men that which is in its length five palms and ten.
And now it has come to me, that it came out of a man of twenty palms.
But if it is cut into you at the time of your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out of every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what has been said before.
Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
Chapter XCIV.
This illness is called in a certain land among us bovine illness; therefore, because it very often happens to cattle, and it is a small single worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the whole body, ascending and descending; and its movement from member to member is shown to the sense, until it bursts wherever it bursts a place in the skin, and comes out.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and serpents, that is, roundworms and pinworms, happen in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malignancy.
Because when it goes in the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there and comes out, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except during its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
But if it penetrates deeply into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies.
And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. But if you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind the eyebrow below it with a good ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient use cleansing of his body, with medicines dissolving putrid, bad humors.
And let him beware of foods producing putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This illness is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain which happens in certain limbs: then it is transferred from limb to limb.
And I indeed have already seen it, according to what I relate to you.
I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling moving with speed, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain departed from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Then she related to me that it revolved in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore I was amazed at the speed of its change from member to member.
And indeed I had not before seen this illness with my own eyes in this manner.
However, I saw many who found pain changing from member to member; and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that it is, except that it is because the woman was one of those who are of the villages, of dry bodies and uncovered veins: hence therefore that changing windiness appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate and of moist bodies, with hidden veins.
Therefore, when you wish its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly; and cut above it until that constricted windiness comes out; and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windinesses, and eliminates them with foul pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar things.
Concerning the extraction of arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall in the body.
Their diversity is this: for among them are those which have large and small points; and concave and blunt ones.
And among them are those which have three angles.
And among them are those which have barbs.
And among them are those which have points.
Those, however, which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two methods.
For either the members are of the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things.
When therefore it falls in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall relate to you afterwards, appear to you, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most instances.
And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the dura mater which is over the brain, are: that a violent headache, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile occur.
And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture similar to porridge comes out from the place of the wound.
And something like the watery part of flesh comes out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something empty.
And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
And coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting follow that.
Know therefore that death approaches without doubt.
And a sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become abscessed, and the color of the sick man changes.
And he breathes out a large, deep breath; and he seeks the intake of cold air.
But if the arrow falls into the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and great shortness of breath occurs with intense pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the faeces comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which has already been broken.
Therefore there is no hope in his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger upon the sick man: then know, that it is mortal.
The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members among them are saved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I saw of the nature of these arrows, that you may understand from it about your treatment.
That is, because an arrow fell upon a certain man in the lachrymal duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Therefore I extracted it for him from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm befell him in his eye.
And I extracted another arrow for a Jew, which fell upon him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small extremity, with which it adhered to its wood: and it was a large arrow from the arrows of Turkish bows, with a smooth iron head, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil accident befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs.
Therefore I made an incision upon it between two guides; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore I worked delicately with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed for him, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision upon the arrow; and I worked upon it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill effect happened to him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound upon it had healed.
After therefore seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound upon it had healed, and the arrow remained inside her: and none of her condition changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound healed, and it remained, causing him little pain: and many similar cases to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had now deviated a little to the right side: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to his treatment after the arrow's impact for three days.
Therefore I found the arrow wound very tight.
Therefore I searched for it with a slender probe, and did not feel it: and he himself found a pricking and pain under his right ear.
Therefore I hoped that that pricking was from the point of the arrow.
Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster which had attractive and digestive power, trusting that the place would suppurate, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I might cut upon it: and there did not happen in the place an event signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Therefore I persevered with the plaster upon him for many days: and there did not happen an event, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained weak from the extraction of it for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose.
And he related that to me.
Therefore I put upon that wound a sharp, corrosive medicine for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed it, I felt the slender point of the arrow adhering in the wood.
Then I widened the opening of the wound by means of that sharp medicine, until the point of the arrow appeared to us visibly: and about four months passed with him.
Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not yield to exit: then I did not cease to refine and devise upon it with ingenious methods, until on a certain day I began upon it with neatly made forceps, as their form will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health: nor did anything harm him at all.
And I relate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and explanation for that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by narration: nor does the book encompass that, and the skillful craftsman compares a little with much: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument, in the descent of strange things of this art when they happen.
Therefore I say that arrows do not come out from the limbs in which they are fixed except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which comes out from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is pulled, and comes out.
But if it does not yield to exit at the time when it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for several days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its traction is lessened, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to exit, then leave it also for several days: and try it with traction and movement every day, until it comes out.
But if it does not yield to exit after days, then it is necessary that you bore around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a thin drill, until the arrow is enlarged.
Then pull it, and remove it.
But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already entered one ventricle of the brain, and some of those symptoms which I have described appear in the patient: then abstain from pulling out the arrow, and leave it until its being is equalized after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach: and the patient remains for some days, and nothing of those symptoms happens to him: then be ingenious in pulling out the arrow and extracting it.
But if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you when you pull it: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
But if the arrow is now hidden in the place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sense: then search for it with a probe.
But if you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot get to it, because of the tightness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then cut it open above it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on every side, by every means you can, and devices, if it cannot be done without tearing the flesh at the fracture of the barbs, and twisting them, until it comes out.
And when you are managing the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it come out: and the finest things with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
But if you cannot get it out in one hour, then leave it for a few days, until those things which are around it putrefy.
Then try again; for the tension will be eased. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said of treatment in its chapter; and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And apply every means possible for the removal of the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you pull out the arrow, you make the patient lie in the same position as he was at the time of the arrow's impact.
Because it is more helpful.
But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the positions.
But an arrow which emerges from the opposite side, or something of it already protrudes outwards, or the end of the arrow makes a swelling on the skin above it by touch, and you see it protruding: therefore cut above it, and let the incision be of such a size that forceps can grasp it.
Then pull it out: for it will then easily come out.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow is embedded in the bone and widens itself; then pull it out.
And if not: leave it for a few days; then try again until it comes out.
And if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it out with that.
But if the wood has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push: then insert a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow; then push it with that.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
For the arrow is lightened by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew the wound, if you see it necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
And many kinds are made of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
The shape of the concave pusher.
And the shape of the blunt pusher.
This is of a blunt end like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be pushed with it.
The end of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing may be eased.
Concerning the bloodletting of veins.
Chapter 97. The veins to be bled, whose custom has run in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbae; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two lacrimal ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and the prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the outer side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And the dark one.
And there is the median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the inner side: and it is also called the Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the cord of the arm, and it is situated above the bend: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with manifest application.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the outside.
And the second is the Saphena: and its place is near the heel from the inner side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is near the heel from the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy, however, of the two veins which are behind the ears, is a benefit for old catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and old bad head ulcers.
And the quality of phlebotomizing it is according to what I relate.
And it is so that the head of the sick person is shaved: and his occiput in the place of the two veins is rubbed with a rough cloth with a good rubbing.
Then let the sick person bind his neck with a fillet, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with ink.
Then take a lancet phlebotome, and it is that which is called Incidens.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the phlebotome reaches the mouth.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and incise the vein with the skin with an incised incision.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and let as much blood flow out as you wish.
Then bind it with lint, and leave it until it heals.
And already the incision and cauterization of them preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries at times.
Truly, the phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is a help for chronic hemicrania, and evil toothache, and persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp effused superfluities to the eyes. And the manner of phlebotomizing them is according to what I relate to you.
Let the sick person tighten his neck very much until two veins appear manifestly to the sense of sight: and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger.
Then mark them with cautery.
Then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the cutting phlebotomy instrument underneath, and raise the vein upwards.
And incise it, as you did in the other two veins: and let blood flow according to the amount of your need. Then loosen the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
Afterwards, place a pledget and lint on it, and bind it above with a strong bandage: and leave it until it heals.
And now the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction has preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Indeed, the help of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is, after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for old facial illnesses: and for hemicrania, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you.
The sick person constricts his neck with a fillet until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument which is called a Fossorium.
Whose form is this.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with another thing in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity which you wish.
Then loosen the perforation of the sick person, and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotomist.
However, it is not necessary that it be a phlebotomist of a sharp end, like the other phlebotomists, indeed it should be of a broad end.
And phlebotomize it according to the transverse: because the bone is near: and perhaps in it the phlebotomist will be broken when it is thin.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins in the two lacrimals.
Moreover, the help of the two veins which are in the two lacrimals of the two eyes, is for the eye from scab and redness: and sebaceous material in the eye, and sicknesses of the face.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of them is, that the infirm person should bind his neck with a bandage.
Then phlebotomize them: and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across rather than lengthwise, with a small, somewhat broad phlebotome, for there is not much flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotome is of a thin point, perhaps it will break.
Then make the blood run as much as is necessary for you.
And place a compress on them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Now the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and violent headache, and facial illnesses, such as hemicrania, and redness which happens in the face; especially when it is longstanding.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should tighten his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long phlebotom; and insert it in the middle of his nose, between that which divides the nose lengthwise.
Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the phlebotom a little while; and you make the blood run according to your need.
Then bind it one night.
For it is restored quickly.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Guidegi.
Indeed, the phlebotomy of the two Guidegi helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosive ones, that is, herpetic esthiomenes.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the sick person should bind himself under both in his neck with a ligature: and the surgeon should stand over the head of the sick person, and the sick person should sit on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to the length of a wide phlebotomy a little.
Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it.
Then do similarly with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and bind the two veins with a moderate binding: so that the sick person is not suffocated.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound heals.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins by Albucasis.
Moreover, the vein Albucasis is helpful for phlebotomy: because it contributes to canker in the mouth, and corruption of the gums: and bad ulcers: and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose, and in its circumference.
And the manner of phlebotomy of them is, that you make the infirm one sit before you: and bind his neck with a fillet.
Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins: of which one is on the right of the lip, and the second on the left of it: and the demonstration of each is through the blackness of both.
And that is true: because in the circumference of them are small, black veins.
Therefore incise each with a cutting incision. But if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is: then attend to the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed custom runs very much with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Indeed, the help of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for suffocations which are in the throat, and disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person sits between your hands before the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it a vein, and on the other side of it a vein: and the color of each inclining towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize each: and take care lest you thrust your hand too far in phlebotomizing them.
For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there will happen a flow of blood from those arteries.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Now the three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are those in whose phlebotomy custom prevails among all men.
And the phlebotomy of them is done according to two methods.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or an olive-shaped one, sloping to a point: or by cutting with a knife-like phlebotome, and that is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is that which is suitable for section.
And of them there are broad and subtle types according to the size and narrowness of the veins.  The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of less breadth, and more subtle point.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of subtle veins which contain subtle, yellowish blood.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Now the basilica, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from sicknesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the breast and belly: and it behooves the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomizes it, that he be cautious, and be mindful of fear from it, for under it is an artery.
If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will happen.
Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a pointed phlebotome; rather, let it be cut with an alnæsyl.
But if the basilica does not appear in manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you leave it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in its place the cord of the arm.
For it itself is manifest, and cut it with the alnæsyl phlebotome, as we have said.
But if you wish the phlebotomy of that same vein, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Then mark the place with a cautery, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the alnæsyl phlebotome, as we have said.
And beware lest the incision fall through the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
But if you see the blood at the phlebotomy leap up, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Then therefore hasten, and place your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its movement: and be watchful of his fear.
And let him not move it for several days, until it is healed.
But if the blood is not cut off, and overcomes you: and you do not have medicine present at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities are constricted, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a pistachio, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein constriction decently, with a bandage and powders until the next day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not: then treat it with that whose mention preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most cases, because of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of bandaging from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the dark vein.
Moreover, the help of phlebotomy of the dark vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be wary of its phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve is often apparent to the sense.
But if it is hidden in some men, and is thin, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy by which you phlebotomize, an incision with an alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is helpful because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by pricking with an olive-shaped phlebotome, or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotome: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve. Nevertheless it is fitting for you in phlebotomy that you avoid with the phlebotome only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first incision, that it is repeated upon it with phlebotomy several times. Nevertheless perhaps it becomes abscessed in some men when it is not phlebotomized at the first incision, but that abscess does not harm it in anything.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Moreover, the quality of phlebotomy, and its consequences therefrom, in whose rectification it behooves you to think.
First therefore of that it is necessary that you know, that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and precaution against the coming of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Median, and the Basilic.
And that phlebotomy be done at the beginning of Spring upon fasting, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomy however which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when suitability and necessity urge to it, in night, or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not fitting that boys be bled until fourteen years come upon them.
Nor let a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Nor let old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore when someone wishes to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if much retained stool is in them: so that the veins do not attract during phlebotomy from the bowels putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Nor let a patient suffering from nausea, that is, sickness, be bled; nor one who is hungover, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Nor one ill with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything which weakens the bodily or animal strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him exercise in some way, so that the blood may be thinned.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and try so that his chest is evacuated that day from all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and similar things.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs, from fragrance, and perfume, and dancing, and similar things, in as much quantity as possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one to be phlebotomized: afterwards let him draw out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or three times.
Then let him tighten the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or excessive in constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then also it prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction it is necessary that the one to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins swell and are apparent to the sense.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the one to be phlebotomized with a little oil, preferably old.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself a little below the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, so that the vein does not slip away and the incision is missed.
Because among the veins there is one which you find like a fleeing string during phlebotomy; and among them there is one which is full of wind; and when you place the phlebotomy instrument on it, it contracts under the phlebotomy instrument, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and he does not open the vein; and if he does open it, it is narrow.  Therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm, and be careful in all these things.
Then let him put down the phlebotomy instrument.
And if not, then repeat it another time a little below that place, or above it quickly, if the place is not festering.
But if it is festering, or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that the quantity of blood you desire will not flow out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening along its length, and add a little to the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes abscessed, for an abscessed place is in many men [a cause of] a small operation.
Therefore if you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat [the phlebotomy] on it at all, for it will not excuse anything for you. And place something of the dregs of oil upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in every phlebotomy of yours, which phlebotomizes veins against the prohibition of the flow of blood; and theriac alfarach and sagzenea do this when one of them is placed upon the place.
For blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
But if a large abscess should happen at the place of phlebotomy—for this often happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or the opening of the vein is small—then hasten and place upon the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little; and bind it for an hour, because it is dissolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from that vein, with the completion of its [the blood's] amount, or from another vein.
And very often indeed abscesses and swellings occur near the phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Therefore place your hand upon it; then if you find softness upon your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Beware therefore that you place upon it something of that which we have said.
For perhaps blood from the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his strength.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it reddens: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it out until it is thinned: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein's phlebotomy be widened, and the phlebotomy be wide: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in installments, and that the opening be narrow: and better which is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is, that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from a flow of blood, and from cutting a nerve: and it is more laudable, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And to whom syncope is accustomed to come upon in phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or in sugarcane juice, if it is warmed: and you should extract blood from him in three or four installments.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in mulberry syrup, or in syrup of honey spiced with spices, or in fragrant spiced syrup.
But if syncope should occur during phlebotomy, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that he take in drink meat broth, and a subtle fragrant syrup: and he should use fragrance with aloeswood, and his chest should be anointed with it: and he should use the other things which we mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
But he who wishes to bleed his arm, and to release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually according to the amount of his strength on consecutive days.
But he who wishes to bleed his arm, and to release his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be bled on the second, or on the third day.
But in whom there is much blood already heated, and it is sharpened, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that much blood depart from him at one time, and that a large quantity be drawn from him: and the opening be enlarged until syncope occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you place your hand upon his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
For often this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to bleed the arm, and to release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon with force, and the bent arm be extended quickly.
For that is very bad; indeed, leave it until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument that which is congealed from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it something of salt dissolved in water.
And place upon it something of theriac alfaroch, or sagzene, and apply it with gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
But if the vein is already abscessed, then leave it, and do not bandage it, until the abscess settles.
But if necessity demands a second bleeding, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another vein in the other arm.
The rope of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the Median and Basilic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should put his hand in warm water until the vein reddens and appears clearly.
Then it should be bound above it with a ligature of moderate tightness.
Then phlebotomize it transversely little by little, neither laterally nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it a little above the joint of the hand.
And indeed the running of blood into warm water is mostly done in the time of winter.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve under it.
Phlebotomy, however, of the Salvatella of the right hand, benefits liver diseases.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that you bind the little finger of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you have put it into warm water, until the vein swells and is very clearly shown.
Then phlebotomize it transversely.
And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And take care not to wound your hand with the phlebotome.
For under it are the nerves of the fingers bared of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then put oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not clot quickly.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
The help, however, of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is contributing to diseases of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
The help, however, of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases which are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and retention of menstrual flow, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his foot into warm water: and make friction upon it, until the veins swell; and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap.
And indeed the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and many branches ramify from it on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence: because it is better and safer.
But if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy, with which you phlebotomize it, transversely, as if you wished to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
But if the exit of blood is prevented, then soak his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
But if the phlebotomist misses the vein at the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry: and bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel with four fingers' breadth, with a long, thin band; for it does not appear otherwise.
When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to the transverse: and it is better, or to incise it with an incision, or to cut it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most men.
But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the dorsum of the foot, and towards the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you wish flow.
Then loosen the constriction, and place leather over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cups are made from horns, and from brass, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways.
With scarification, and extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body for cuppings which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood.
Of which one is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck from two parts together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the spine: and the cuppings of the two cubits, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two thighs: and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that strength does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor is it necessary that cupping be administered, whether with fire or without fire, in any illnesses which occur from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity prompts cupping because of illness or custom, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Which is because there are men in whom blood is multiplied until it needs extraction by cupping, and they find heaviness and headache in their head.
And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the place of their cupping. And some of them have increased laughter.
And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood.
And some of them have increased sleep.
And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them. Therefore, when we see something of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order that bloodletting be done, after two or three hours of the day have passed. But the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and what is poured out into the eyes.
