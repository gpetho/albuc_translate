On the Hygiene of Boys and Treatment of Accidental Injuries that Occur to Them.	On the circumcision of boys; and the correction of their erroneous treatment.	0.7156209
Circumcision is nothing but the separation of a connection, like other surgical procedures, but since it is done by our own will and is performed specifically on boys, we must describe the best practice for it.	Circumcision is nothing but a solution of continuity like other wounds: but as it is a result of our deliberate action, and as it is done particularly to boys, we should plan in this case the very best operation, and the easiest way that leads to safety.	0.7846197
And the easiest way that leads to safety. I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their religions, but rather it is something we have adopted.	Now the Ancients made no mention of circumcision in any of their books, since it was not practised in their religion; but it is something we have acquired by experience.	0.7260907
Through experience, I have found that most surgeons and cuppers perform circumcision using a scalpel and scissors, and they use a fibula, thread ligature, and cutting with the fingernail. I have tried all of these methods.	I have myself seen the common run of practitioners and barbers carry it out with razor and with scissors; they use a spindle-whorl, a ligature of thread, and incision by means of the finger-nail. I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature.	0.8197541
I have not found anything better than circumcision using scissors and ligature with thread, because when circumcising with a scalpel, the skin often adheres to it because the foreskin has two layers, and sometimes the outer layer is cut while the inner layer remains.	I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature. For circumcision carried out with the razor is often eluded by the skin; for the skin of the prepuce is of two layers; and often the outer skin is incised and the inner is left intact, so that a second incision is needed, and renewed pain; while when the circumcision is done with a spindle-whorl you are in danger of cutting the tip of the penis, since the tip often goes into the aperture of the whorl.	0.7657553
This necessitates another cut and renewed pain. Circumcision with a fibula risks cutting the tip of the urethra, as it may enter its opening. As for circumcision with the fingernail, the skin may slip and ruin your work, or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short...	As for circumcision by the finger-nail, the nail will often slip off the skin and your operation be spoilt; or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short, for many are born thus, not needing circumcision.	0.58592176
They are often born like this, not needing circumcision, and I have seen this. As for circumcision with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors cut evenly since the upper blade is like the lower blade.	I have seen this myself. Experience has taught me the superiority of circumcision with the scissors and the thread ligature.	0.62763727
So when you squeeze your hand, coordinating the two blades, they cut evenly and at the same time, so the ligature becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra on all sides, so no error occurs at all. The method is, first, to distract the boy.	For scissors cut evenly, since the upper edge of the scissors is exactly the same as the lower edge; and so, as you compress your hand, thanks to the correspondence of the two blades you cut equally and simultaneously; and you make the girdle of the thread like a wall all round the skin of the tip of the penis: thus no error can occur.	0.6678851
Especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you are only tying the thread around his urethra and leaving it until another day. Then make him happy and delight him in every way you can and that his mind accepts. Then have him stand between your hands, upright.	The manner of operating is first to make the boy, especially if he is one who understands a little, imagine that all you are going to do is tie a ligature on the tip of the penis and leave it for another day.	0.5730418
He should not be sitting. Hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot; the boy's eye should not fall on them at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then insert your hand into his foreskin and blow into the skin, and lift it up until the tip of the urethra emerges.	Then amuse him and cheer him as much as you can, according to his intelligence; then stand him upright before you, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot and do not let the boy's eye chance upon that or any other instrument.	0.80784893
Then clean it of any dirt that has accumulated in it. Then tie the marked area with a double thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it. Then grasp firmly with your thumb and index finger the place of the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and expose the tip of the urethra. Then let the blood flow a little; this is better and causes less swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dried gourd, for it is the best thing I have tried, or knotgrass flour, which is also excellent.	Then with your hand take hold of the tip of the penis, blow into the foreskin, and draw it back till the glans penis is exposed; then cleanse from it all unclean matter that has collected. Then ligate the indicated place with a double ligature, and a second right round beneath; then take hold at the site of the lower ligature with thumb and forefinger, very firmly, and cut between the ligatures; then quickly push back the skin and draw out the glans penis; then let a little blood flow, for that is all the better and prevents the swelling of the tip of the penis; then wipe it with a piece of soft cloth, then sprinkle on it ashes of dried gourds (this is the best of all that I have tried) or else fine white flour, which is also good; then apply on top of the powders a piece of linen with egg-yolk cooked in rosewater, beaten up with fresh oil of roses of good quality.	0.90057933

Leave this on the wound until the following day; then dress it in the usual way till healed.	0.85777634
This is a picture of the scissors that are suitable for circumcision:	This is the type of scissors most suitable for circumcizing.	0.5972379
They should be sharp, cutting, without any bend, with a secure screw, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the two handles. As for the mistakes that occur in circumcision, sometimes the inner skin, all or part of it, folds over during the cutting, so it is necessary to immediately extend it with your fingernail before the area swells.	They should be fiat-nosed, sharp, with no bend in them, and with the pivot tempered ; and the length of the handles should be equal to that of the blades. Now the mistake often occurring in circumcision is for the inner layer of skin, either the whole or the part, to be inverted at the cutting. So you should at the start draw it out with your finger-nail before the place swell; then make an even incision.	0.7958777
And cut it evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it.  If three days have passed and what is under the tip of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute swelling subsides and then gently peel it off.	And if you are unable to get a hold with your finger-nail then pick it up with a hook and make your incision. If after three days there still remains some inflation and swelling of the part below the tip of the penis, let it be until the effusion subsides, and then gently peel it away and cut it as best you may.	0.85518026
And cut it as much as is feasible for you, but be careful of the tip of the urethra. If a part of the tip of the urethra is cut, it will not cause harm. Treat it with wound-healing powders that we have described in the chapter on powders.	Be careful of the tip of the penis; though if any of the tip is cut away that will do no harm. And dress the wound with stimulating medicaments from among the powders that we described in the treatise on powders.	0.7709558
And if more than necessary is cut from the skin and it retracts upwards, it will not cause much harm either. Treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.	Should more of the skin be cut away than necessary and the skin is wrinkled up, that will do no great harm either. Continue such treatment as we have mentioned, until healed.	0.8697121
