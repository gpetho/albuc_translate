The first chapter, in it are sentences and summaries on the matter of bone fractures, which must be presented.
And before we begin to mention the broken and dislocated limbs one by one, it is necessary to mention at the beginning of this chapter some words and sections that first compel you and those other than you who are eager to learn this noble craft to understand them and comprehend their reality, so I say that whenever someone experiences a fracture, dislocation, contusion, or fall, it is necessary to first hasten to phlebotomize him, give him a laxative, or both, unless there is something that prevents this, such as weakness of strength, or if the one who experienced this is a boy, a senile old man, or if the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold. Then his diet should be restricted to cold vegetables, poultry meat, and kid meat, and he should be prevented from drinking alcohol, thick meats, filling up on food, and any food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling subsides and there is no longer expectation of matter flowing to the site. At that time, let the patient return to his first regimen, which is his usual habit.
When the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that are very nourishing, thick, and firm, and contain stickiness, such as harees, rice, heads, trotters, cow tripe, eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and so on, for with this regimen the healing of the fracture will be faster and better.
And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, can never connect and heal to their original nature, due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, and bones that are extremely soft, like the bones of young children, may connect and heal. However, nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something like thick glue that adheres to it and strengthens it until it sticks together and binds together until it becomes extremely strong and firm as it was before, so that nothing hinders its actions.
For this reason, it is necessary to make the patient's diet consist of foods that contain firmness, stickiness, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures may vary according to the difference in limbs, because a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the sternum is different from a fracture of the back, and so on for all the other limbs, each different from the other.
And we will mention each type of fracture explained in its chapter, detailed separately from others.
And the type of bone fracture may also vary in itself, because it may be a fragmented fracture without splinters, or it may be a fracture along the length of the bone with splinters and protrusions, either loose or not loose, and the fracture may be accompanied by a wound and a tear in the skin, or the fracture may be a minor crack.
And each type has a specific technique for its treatment, as will be mentioned in detail in its place.
And among the things by which a bone fracture is recognized are its curvature, its protuberance, its appearance to the senses, and its crepitation when you press it with your hand. So when there is no apparent curvature in the site, no crepitation, no feeling of disturbance when you palpate the bone, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture there, but it may be a contusion, a minor fracture, or a minor crack. So it is not necessary to move it by extension and pressing at all, but apply to it the medicines that will be mentioned later that suit the site, then tighten it gently.
And know that if the bone is broken into two without splinters, but each part has moved away from its counterpart, you should immediately proceed to straighten and align it before hot swelling occurs.
If hot swelling occurs, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
And know that its treatment and alignment are easier than a bone that has splinters.
Then tighten it as will be mentioned.
If the bone has splinters, it is necessary to extend the broken limb from both sides, whether it is a hand or a leg, either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your placement of the limb be on a level surface, in its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken bone are extended, then quickly return those protrusions to their places in every way you can with skill and gentleness, and strive your best not to cause the patient any pain or suffering with your actions, and strive your best to join one bone to its counterpart in the best way.
And it is necessary at that time to touch and palpate them with your hand. If you see something wrong there, correct and align it as much as you can.
And beware of excessive extension and strong pressing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause hot swelling or chronic pain in the limb with their actions, as I have witnessed their actions many times.
Then, after alignment, perfection, and tightening, keep that limb still and at rest, and warn the patient not to move it during his waking and sleeping hours, and when he turns and moves, and when he defecates, and in all his movements to the best of his ability, and let him ensure that the position of the limb is a position in which he is safe from pain.
This is because whenever he feels pain or suffering when positioning the limb, he should move it to another position in which he does not feel pain, and he should ensure that this position is level and straight so that no curvature occurs in the limb when it heals.
As for how to tighten the broken limb, it is as I am describing to you.
Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness, largeness, and structure. So what is small among them, such as the arm, finger, ulna, and so on, the cloth bandages should be soft and thin, and what is thick among them, such as the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be wide and firm, because the wide bandage adheres to the large limb and tightens it from every side evenly, without any gaps.
Then, after you have finished aligning, apply the appropriate ointment on a soft cloth to the fracture site, then start wrapping the bandage around the fracture site itself three or four times, depending on what the limb requires, and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage, then go with it to the upper side of the fracture site with less tightening than your tightening of the fractured site, then move the wrapping slightly away from the fracture site and loosen the tightening gradually until you take something suitable from the healthy area. Then take another bandage and also wrap it around the fractured site a few times, then go with the wrapping to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the wrapping be as we mentioned in the first upper wrapping. Then place between the bandages of the soft cloth or rags whatever levels the curvature of the fracture if there is curvature, otherwise, do not put anything in it.
Then wrap another bandage around it, then immediately apply the firm splints over these wraps if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation in it, apply to it what soothes that swelling and removes the swelling, and leave it for a few days, then tighten the splints on it at that time. And let the splints be made of wide, carved, and wisely prepared reed halves, or let the splints be made of sieve wood, which is made from pine, palm leaf stalks, heather, or alkali, and so on, of what is available.
And let the width of each splint be exactly like this image and this shape, except that the splint that is placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints.
As for the length of the splint, it is made according to what is appropriate for the broken limb, in terms of its size.
Image of the splint:
Then you tighten over the splints with another bandage, according to your first tightening exactly, then you tie from above with tight threads according to what we mentioned about the tightening, which is that your tightening on the site of the fracture be more, and the further away from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, like what I have seen from the actions of the ignorant who make their threads from twisted linen strips, which is a grave mistake, because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and the thin threads are also not suitable because you will not achieve the tightening you desire with them.
And there should not be less than a finger's width between the splint and the splint, and if the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the correct places, then put under them soft lint or fluffed wool so that it does not harm him in any way.
And if the fracture is with a wound and a tear in the skin has occurred, we will mention it separately.
And know that not every fractured limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, because if the limb is large, the splints should not be placed on it except after five days or seven or more, depending on your safety from the occurrence of a hot swelling.
And this is the description of the bandages with which the ancients used to set fractures, which are placed on the fracture, the jaw, and the sprain.
Description of a brief, common bandage that sets fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is neither predominantly hot nor cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the millstone, which is the heart of the flour that clings to the walls of the millstone during the movement of the mill, then you knead it as it is, without sifting it, with egg white, and you make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then you use it.
Description of another bandage that sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Take ten dirhams each of mastich, labdanum, acacia, frankincense, bark of the acacia tree, and sugar, five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe, twenty dirhams of tamarisk, and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Greek clay; pound all together and mix with tamarisk water or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then use this bandage, for it is well-composed, quickly sets broken bones, and is suitable for most people due to its moderation.
Description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains.
Take ten dirhams each of acacia bark, mastich, and white marshmallow, five dirhams each of myrrh and aloe, six dirhams of acacia, twenty dirhams of Armenian clay; pound all together finely, sift, and knead with water or egg white, and use.
Description of a bandage for joints and bones displaced from their places, and it soothes the pain that occurs to them, and for bone fissures and fractures.
Take clarified wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area.
This bandage does not have the strength to set bones, but it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pains in particular.
Description of another bandage that sets broken bones.
Take the leaves of the mute fig and the leaves of wild poppy, pound them together, and apply them moist.
Description of another brief bandage used when the bone fracture is setting and you want to resolve the remaining swelling.
Take one part each of marshmallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and cress seed flour; pound all together and knead it with clay if the limb is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or with water and use it.
Description of another bandage, stronger in resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when the bone is setting.
Take one part each of marshmallow root, flax seed, fenugreek, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; pound all together and knead with purslane water or fresh water or with clay, all depending on the heat of the limb and the calmness of its heat.
As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that anything be placed on the fractured limb when setting it except the cerate made from wax and oil, nothing else, and he described it as being medium between thick and thin.
As for Galen, he saw that things that have dryness with some heat, such as myrrh, aloe, frankincense, and similar to what we mentioned, should be placed on the fractured limb when setting it.
Description of a bandage that is useful for weakness and pain.
Take equal parts of acacia bark, chickpeas, cut human hair or bird feathers, marshmallow, and salt; pound, sift, knead, and apply as a bandage.
As for the amount of time the bandage should remain then be loosened, it is that you observe, and if the patient does not experience pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place, then do not loosen it for many days.  If severe itching, disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area, then hasten to loosen it immediately and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it.
Then take a soft cloth or a moist sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside. Then leave the limb to rest for an hour, then apply to it clarified wool dipped in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and tie it on for a night until you are safe from hot swelling, the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain goes away.  Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as your first tightening, and be gentle with it until it heals.
If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, swelling, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need the bandage and tightening, then reapply it as you did initially, exactly.
If none of what we mentioned occurs in the limb, do not loosen it except after three days or four or five or seven, and it may be left for twenty days, all of that depending on what you observe of the condition of the limb, as we said, until the fracture sets and the flesh nearly coagulates on it, then increase the tightening more than your first tightening altogether, and also increase the thickening of the patient's food as mentioned previously.
If you see that the site of the fracture has dried and become emaciated more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it, so moisten it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let that be every three days, and slightly reduce the tightening, for by this action nourishment will flow to the limb and it will heal quickly.
As for what the ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the limb again if it did not set properly the first time and set crookedly, it is a mistake of their doing and a great deception. If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it, and I have not seen any trace of that from any of them at all, and the correct thing is not to do it.
