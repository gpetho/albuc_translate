This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made for a disease called "soda", and for many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness such as paralysis and lethargy and apoplexy and similar illnesses.	This cauterization helps against excessive humidity and coldness on the brain, which cause headache, abundance of defluxions from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, excess of sleep, toothache, sore throat, and in general any sort of disorder arising from frigidity, such as palsy, fits, apoplexy, and diseases similar to these.	0.70099187
The method for this cautery is that the patient be purged by a dissolving medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age and constitution of the patient can bear; and then shave the patient's head.	The manner of performing this operation is first to bid the patient open the bowels with an evacuant which will also clear his head, for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient.	0.8531958
Then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his chest; then place the base of your palm on the bridge of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle finger falls, bleed from there, then heat the cautery which is called "olive-shaped", of which this is the form:	Then tell him to have his head shaved; then seat him cross-legged before you, with his hands on his breast. Then place the lower part of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes; and where your middle finger reaches mark that place with ink. Then heat an olivary cautery.	0.83860433
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is purged; and for this it helps to change dressings.	The Ancients said that the more a wound is kept open, discharging pus, the better and more efficacious.	0.68091893
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burned, and then cut away what is burned from the bone, and it should be treated.	Some said the skin was to be cauterized through to the bone and the cautery held until some of the thickness of the bone was burnt. Then the burnt bone was to be scraped out, then dressed.	0.77489734
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so hard that one lowers the bone as wide as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors come out more easily; and one should leave the wound open for a long time; then one should clean and solder it.	Then the burnt bone was to be scraped out, then dressed. Others said that the cautery should be carried through to burn a deep impression in the bone so that there should come out of the bone a piece shaped like a grain of a carob tree or a small spindle-whorl; they asserted that the vapours of the head would be exhaled through this place. The wound should be kept open a long while, then dressed until healed.	0.7219944
And these two ways of cauterizing do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some men where there is a way of fear; and it seems to me that I should leave it; for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other limbs; and even when the patient's head is naturally weak, the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and this one I use in all work, with salvation.	But these two methods of cauterization I do not consider right except on certain men; and I regard them as risky. In my opinion, to let the patient alone is preferable and safer, if it is to be. For the head is weakened when its natural continuity is broken, as we see in other parts, and particularly when the patient's head is weak by nature. In my opinion the first type of cauterization is safer and better; therefore use that and be safe.	0.83822155
