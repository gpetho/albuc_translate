After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end of it, from its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Because the operation with the hand is prostrate in our region and in our time, completely deprived, until perhaps its science perished, and its trace was cut off: and there remained from it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have changed: and error and hesitation happened to them, until its intentions were closed, and its force was removed: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way of exposition, and explanation, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of the instruments of cautery, and the other instruments of the work: when it is done by the addition of explanation, and by the hastening of what is necessary.
The reason, however, why a good craftsman with his hand is not found in this our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised before it in the science of anatomy, which Galen has narrated, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their course, and of pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exit.
And because of that Hippocrates said that the name is much with the name, and little with the work, and especially in the art of the hand.
We indeed already said about that in the introduction of this book.
Because he who is not knowing what we said about anatomy is not emptied, but already falls into error, by which men are killed: just as I saw many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experiment.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large. Therefore he arrived at it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder. Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land on account of medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture above the wound with cushions and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he cured him according to his desires. Afterwards he dismissed him after several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained so until his leg and his foot became suppurated, and came to ruin.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and calmness followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Nevertheless, the corruption was already established in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated afterwards, until its malignancy was magnified with its master.
That is, because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb which can tolerate having the whole of it cut off.
And for that reason, O my son, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation associated with safety: and operation with which there is danger in many conditions.
And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where an operation occurs which involves terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid it and leave it alone, so that fools may not find a way to speak of it and bring dishonor.
Therefore take measures with care and protection, and treat your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and laudable success: and leave alone terrible illnesses of difficult healing: and remove your minds from that which makes you afraid, lest hesitation enter into your faith and your well-being.
For it is more conducive to your glory, and more exalted in this world, and finally to your rewards.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.
Now however I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
Chapter one.
Concerning cautery with fire, and cautery with a sharp medicine, chaptered and ordered from head to foot, and the forms of instruments, and the tools of cautery: and everything which is necessary in the operation.
Chapter two.
Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things to that: and the whole chaptered, ordered with forms of instruments.
Chapter three.
Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of torsion, and similar things: chaptered, ordered from head to foot, and with forms of instruments.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its helps and harms: and in what complexion it should be exhibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse concerning the quality of the help of cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science, and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have also spoken on it, and they have disagreed: and indeed a little from their sayings suffices me, fearing prolixity.
Therefore I say that cautery benefits universally every complexion which is with matter and without matter, except for two complexions, which are a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
However, in a hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed. For some have said that cautery is helpful in it. And others said the contrary of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in the illness which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness should be healed with something hot and dry.
And he who says the contrary of that said: that through cautery help is given in every hot and dry illness which happens in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I indeed say through his account: because experience has already revealed that to me several times.
Nevertheless it is not fitting that he come to that, except he who is already proven and practiced in the chapter of cautery, in the final exercise, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration.
From the other complexions however there is no fear for you: and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For already all physicians have agreed upon them: and they did not disagree in helping with cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of treatment by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with little harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes illness difficult to heal in a member, and perhaps it kills.
Fire however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from lengthy speech.
And if it were not that it is not permitted in this my book, I would bring to you a hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with a philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be sharpened by your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree in the time in which it is fitting to perform cautery, and they place the better time in spring.
And I say that cautery is fitting at all times: because the harm occurring because of time is submerged in the benefit which is attracted with cautery. And especially if cautery is because of pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains which do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that a greater harm might occur than the small harm entering because of time.
And let not that fall into your minds, O sons, which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that that illness which is healed by cautery does not always return: and they posit this as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the causes why pains occur.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its health, and the strength of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and that which arrives at it in its acquisition from foods, and similar causes, unless the illness in which cautery is administered occurs.
An illness subtle in a member of few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth because of pain, and similar things, for it is possible that that pain may not return in it. But that happens in few cases.
But truly the speech of the common people again, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a right speech: not to that which they intend in it: for they believe that there is no cure which confers with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of cautery.
The matter, however, is contrary to that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not so, except when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it helps: then it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
The ancients, however, said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say that, except because of the evenness of gold and the excellence of its substance: and they said that the place of cautery does not produce pus. But that is not true absolutely: because I have now proven that, and I have found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said. However, when you heat a cautery in the fire made of gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the desired amount, because of the redness of the gold; and when it approaches cold, and if you add more heating to it, it melts in the fire and turns into flakes.
Therefore, the craftsman falls into difficulty with it: and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and more convenient for us, because of its suitability for the operation.
And I have indeed arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot: so that they may alleviate for the one seeking what he wants from it.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the control of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of headache, and an abundance of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and an abundance of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and universally every illness which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the patient: that he be purged first with a cleansing resolvent medicine for three or four nights, according to what the strength of the patient, and his age, and his habit require.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. Then make him sit squarely between your hands, so that he now places his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink.
Then heat the olive cautery; its form is this.
Then place it on the place marked with ink, descending, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will roll it. Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the place.
If you see now revealed from the bone the amount of the head of alkiel, or the amount of zeuherbi, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another like it if it cools; until you see the bones which I told you about.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cautery in it, and place it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Then place on it the cautery soaked in butter, and leave it on the place, until the fire scab is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Then shave off what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the end with the cautery, until it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls, which is made like the shape of a kirate: or an instrument that women put in the infusion of small letters: and they think that vapors from the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it consolidates.
But to me these two types of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain men, according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better for its health.
For the head is weakened by the separation of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it safely.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses bleedings, and potions, and head purges, and oils, and cataplasms. And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefit him: then consider. For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below it. Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, until the skin is not pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is uncovered. And cauterize it with one cautery in the occiput of his head, in the place which is called a vessel: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your instrument in this, and do not uncover the bone. For the sick person finds because of that a very intense pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I shall call this cauterization in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cauterization, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput with a finer cautery, by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Chapter IV.
When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, is administered, and it does not entirely help: then cauterization is used in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Now, cauterization with a sharp burning medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides. Then incise the painful area at the time with a broad phlebotomy knife, until a space is made under the skin in which the clove is placed.
Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden: then bind over it with a suitable compress, and leave it for fifteen hours; then unbind it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards apply a piece of cloth soaked in butter to it, until the place produces pus: then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish to do it with some burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on burning medicines.
Cauterization with an iron, however, is in this manner. A fire cautery, whose shape is this.
And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Then place it on the place, and hold your hand: and you slowly revolve the iron with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, as much as half of it. And lift your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood happens.
Then soak a pledget in salt water, and place it on the place, and leave it for three days: then place the pledget with butter: afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second knife-like extremity of the Cautery. And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an old hemicrania.
When you treat a hemicrania with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said about the first cautery with medicine, or with fire cautery, is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white after you mark on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and place your hand in one position, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves in mastication, lest the side be burned, or the nerve which moves it, from which a spasm may result.
And be watchful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut. For in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with that in the first instance.
And I will come with a recollection of the regime of the flow of blood happening from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives. For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in earache.
When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with resolvents and the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and it is that which is called a point, whose form is this.
Then make points with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is rolled around; or around both, if pain is in both at the same time. And move the cautery away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with the cautery; and let the quantity of the cautery be ten points in each ear, and about that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a twisted [or contorted] condition.
Chapter VII.
The twisted condition which is treated with cauterization is only from the species which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
And avoid cauterization of the species which happens from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this species of twisted condition with bleedings, and purgations of the head, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower from its temple, and a third at the conjunction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part. Because softening does not happen except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the end of the upper ear under the horn of the head a little: and another in the temple: whose length is according to the length of a thumb. And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form has been described: however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that there be a little superfluous thickness in the knife.
Then treat the place with what preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery in the occiput of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Also, cauterization is done with a cautery over the stomach; and this is more extreme.
Then let him be treated with what preceded.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that at first, great hiera and pills purifying the brain be given to the sick person in a drink.
Then shave the whole head of the sick person, and place upon his occiput a plaster of mustard described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
For this is the method of cauterization: and do it according to the same order which I described there.
Therefore if he is healed by it, it is good. If not: then make for him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the width of a finger.
Then take care of the cauterization, with that which preceded.
But if you wish an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it: then make for him a cauterization in the middle. But if you wish an addition: then cauterize it above the two horns.
Then treat it until it heals: and let the cauterization be olive-shaped according to the form which was described before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyssop, and with that which we said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery behind it, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.
But if you need in the sickness a softening of the body with more of those things, and the infirm person is tolerant, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery, until much of his skin is burned, and raise your hand. Then take care of him until he is healed: and thus cauterize Oliuare.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized, except one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with herbs, and with the other treatment which we have described in the division: when the patient is strong, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and mastications cleansing the brain are administered beforehand for many days with improvement of diet.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery in his occiput, and above every horn of his head with a cautery. But if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a thin cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in melancholia.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the case of one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined toward melancholia, and the body of the infirm is moist, then give him something to drink which will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the infirm, and afterward make a properly made compress of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and the infirm person sitting squarely should be held on all sides.
Then present the liniment. And it is more worthy from old sheep butter. And heat it over a fire with a temperate measured heat, which a finger can tolerate when inserted into it. Then empty it in the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this for the patient once every week, with his other good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making very small points of it, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: rather let it be by smelling.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Then place on it a piece of cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the water descending to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is shown to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and purge the patient with that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him on the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes at once; or on one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples: and beware of a flow of blood.
If you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and caution from a flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old, constant, and are upon the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones. And if you need addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in nasal stench.
When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the medication does not help: then hasten, and give the patient  infirmocochias to drink for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And be careful of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not move your hand with the cautery too much, but according to the amount that burns a third of the eyelid.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, stinging the eye.
Cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, however, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanse them, until they are lengthened and made even. But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they grow.
When therefore they grow and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage upon the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the shape which you marked, little by little in many times, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, the whole appearing properly.
And a sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days.
Then place on it a pledget with butter, until the eschar is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some of the hairs return after a time, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did at first.
But if the hairs are below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is level so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
It is to instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even. Make from paper or cloth a shape like a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, one ounce of each or thereabouts; then grind them together well and quickly, so that it does not get cold. Then spread some of it on the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids. And place under the eye a piece of cotton soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently. And you should move it whenever the patient feels the medicine biting; for its bite is like fire.
While, therefore, the biting sensation persists, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger. When, therefore, the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid rising, as it rises with burning or with incision, it is well: and if not, then apply more medicine to the place where the medicine does not impress and does not blacken, until your operation is even, and the eye is contracted.
Then place a pledget with butter on it until the burnt skin is eradicated. Then treat it with diaphnic ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in the operation that you observe the utmost care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens afterwards, and something fights from the hairs in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first. Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness. Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a lachrymal fistula.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom, and let a servant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken.
Then place a cotton pledget soaked in egg white or in flaxseed mucilage over his eye; then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish it to be upward, try it thus.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then squeeze the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and draw out its pus.
Then apply the cautery, which is made very hot, to it.
And hold your hand with it a little near the cautery from the eye, toward the side of the nose, so that your hand may not err, or the patient be disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
Therefore, if you reach the bone with the beginning of your cautery, it will be good. And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then apply a pledget with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if forty days have passed, and it is not healed, then put a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the ancients mentioned. Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and incise it; then place in the incision a thin tube, that is, a thin cannula, whose shape is this. And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with good retention of the cannula, and let the patient not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the eye of the patient a compress soaked in egg white or in water.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said, by cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer to the opening of the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come in its own place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Fissures, which are called chaps, often occur on the lip, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures with what we have said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then cauterize with a small, knife-shaped cautery iron, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then quickly apply the heated iron to the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with cerate until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then it forms pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to apply a heated cautery according to the size it occupies in the fistula. Then insert the heated instrument into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said concerning treatment until it is cured.
If therefore the pus is cut away and it heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come into its head.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the gums and softened teeth.
When the gum is softened because of humors, and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then a cautery of fire, whose form will come later, so that you place a cannula on the tooth: and quickly insert the heated cautery into it: and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has now reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the loose tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humor is dried.
Concerning the method of cauterizing for toothache.
When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in the tooth, and treatment with medicines is ineffective: then cauterization is indicated in two ways: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
Now cauterization with butter is performed by taking cow's butter and melting it in an iron spoon or in a small pan. Then take a small piece of cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe. Then dip it into the melted butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton into cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; then place a hot iron on top of it until the heat penetrates to the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterization with fire is done by using a bronze or iron tube. And let there be something of thickness in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, whatever shape it may be, and place it on that tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either that same day or another.
And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as far as possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in strumae.
When strumae are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly: then a concave cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may escape from the cautery from one end: and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time if it is needed, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
But if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it lint infused in butter until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until it heals in the shape of a tube.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of the voice and shortness of breath.
When humors overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated first with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it in the uvula near the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware lest you reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the last vertebra, finishing it: and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the method which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in illnesses of the lung and cough.
When cough and illness of the lung are from cold humors, and the infirm person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is of long standing: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicle in depressed, soft, empty places. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be a cannula according to the form which preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called a Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing of earache: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form. Therefore the cauterization is alleviated with it, when you do with it at once three cauterizations.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of humors, and it is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation in the first place. Then let the patient be laid on his back, or on his sound side. Then raise the skin which is in the inner armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then have a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauterizations.
And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then becomes six cauterizations: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the probe.
And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added in this way, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery. Then make the patient adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
When coldness and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it away from its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied to it, and continuous methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and that he extend his legs and his hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular. And lengthen the distance between them so that they do not join, when they produce pus.
And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for him who is frightened by this cautery: and it is so that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with a cautery: then cauterize it with a pointed cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from gross flatulence, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous evacuation, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be laid supine on his neck, and you mark with a cautery three cauterizations according to this figure, and this same quantity on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the elbow of a man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, half that quantity not added: and let the sick person be standing on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who now extends his legs and raises his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And indeed it is possible for you to cauterize these cauterizations with a knife-cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too deeply in the cauterization, and burn the whole thickness of the skin, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
When an exit wound occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person suffers pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the membrane of the liver, there is intense sharp pain; and you see now that its treatment has wearied the physicians.
Therefore, the patient must lie on his back. Then mark the location of the abscess with a cautery; then heat a cautery that resembles a ray. And this is its form. And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery, except for one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these illnesses occur with some experience: then indeed let him dare to perform such an operation.
But truly, to leave it, is better for me.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy in this manner. And it is, that you should receive of the long dried roots of birthwort, one longer root, which is found among them, and let it be like the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil: and ignite it in the fire. Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat obliquely below the chin towards the part which is under the beard.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib somewhat obliquely towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And with three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary that you compress your hand with the cautery, rather let it be evident on the skin by smelling.
And now some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a ray: and they ignite it, and internally insert it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no healing.
Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with that which we have said of treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then cautery is used in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
One of which is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, whose figure preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the amount of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
And let the method of cautery be, as we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you ignite a cautery having two prongs, which we spoke of in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and lift the skin which is in line with the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches: and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin with them on the other side: then withdraw the cautery: therefore four cauteries are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you let it go, that it discharges pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than the other things which preceded from the treatment.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Cautery does not fall in dropsy, except for ascites properly.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direction of the chest, and another in the direction of the stomach: and let the quantity of the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cautery with it: for it is necessary that two intentions are combined for him; and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The form, however, of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized, is nail-shaped: according to what preceded its form; and that with which the back is cauterized, is olive-shaped according to what preceded its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
When abscesses form in a dropsical patient and are filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the space which is between the little and ring fingers; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
Then the yellowish water will sweat out, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Then make two cauteries on each of the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and on each hip two cauteries; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things which we have mentioned.
Concerning the method of cauterization in looseness of the bowels.
Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of treatment, and is not healed; and you see the patient tolerating cauterization of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery; and with a large cautery over the alcatin above the alhosos, or with two cauteries.
And if you see exuberant humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and with a cautery over each ilium; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower vertebra of the back under the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and with a cautery below the navel as if by two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming inflamed, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize above his liver, and another above his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him, until he is healed.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut away althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert it, heated, into the excised althelul: and  move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated. Then treat them with what benefits them of ointments until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more ultimate in aid.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter 38.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and the operation which we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he may be cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus and corrupt humors flow from it. It is therefore more fitting that you should probe it with a slender probe. Then ascertain the amount of its depth with a probe.
Then heat a cautery which is similar to a ray. Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula and the amount that the nail entered.
And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all those places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it heals.
But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a rotten bone is in its depth, or something like that from those things: the mention of which will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from gross flatulence, and the patient’s strength is diminished because of it, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen on the kidneys themselves, cauterizing each kidney with a cautery iron, the mention of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidatu itself. Therefore three lines will result. Therefore the last will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, until the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and cauterize from the right side of the pubis, and another from the left: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the thumb's knuckle; and cauterize it with a cautery of the lower back, or two cauteries, if you need it: and let it be according to the preceding cautery of the nail.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb.
When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain happens to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the pubis on the lower back, or two cauteries; and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
When mucous humors are poured out to the socket of the hip, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other, when they are compared together; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the socket of his hip with a cautery similar to a circle: after you mark with a hot iron around the socket, as it is rotated: and so that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
But if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the amount of the thickness of all the skin.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness, and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic, then it is necessary that you purge the patient of gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things. Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is, that you cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations, according to this form. And make them a good, or bad, depth. And let the space that is between each cauterization be the amount of the thickness of a finger: and let the cauterization be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, a cauterization is done in the middle on the head of the hip joint itself. Therefore there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, which preceded in form in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, with one: so that it is a circle containing the whole hip.
And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and with your cautery above the ankle with four fingers to the outside a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he points with a pointed cautery, with three, or four, or more, if it needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And beware in all your cauterization, lest you reach with the cautery so as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and draw through that upon the sick person a serious harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was wholly perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a breaking of the belly, and death after that.
But if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men have said concerning the cauterization of the hip, of which this is the method of cautery. Make a similar tube of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or somewhat less: and within that tube let there be a third tube.
And let the space which is between each tube be the amount of a thumb-joint: and let the tubes be open on two sides: and let their height be about a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron decently fitted to the tubes.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-socket, the patient lying on his healthy side. Cauterize him therefore with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave him for three days. Afterwards, apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days. Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, "With this kind of cautery, O my sons, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance: and therefore, because we have found few who would endure it.
Nevertheless, it is among the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds with it its place.
Now the cautery with burning medicines is such that you make two samia having a perforated ring, into which descends a hinge of its door made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall: on whose height there are two nodes, or something like them.
And let the space which is between both be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that which they contain be joined together, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip socket, the patient lying on the healthy side. And press your hand very much upon the hip socket. Then pour between the two circles some warm water, which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for the amount of an hour: and let the patient endure its biting and its burning, for he finds the biting like fire, until the biting ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it. For it is the ultimate in aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him sit in what contains water, as you did with the hip equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, one part of each; grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that the ray may enter; and put under the bottom of the pot another glass pot; and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, which submerges both by a finger’s breadth; after which you compress them with your hand with good compression; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over more lime; and filter until it is renewed.
For then it will be of very strong sharpness, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other members. Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines are those with which ankles are cauterized, also such as tesisie, and cashew nut oil, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
And Galen indeed, in narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from antiquity, by which he was cured of hip pain and sciatica; and he magnified it to be very great. And he said that he did not need another cure, and that he was healed in a single time, until he recounted that he perhaps entered the bath carried, and came out of it already healed.
And it is so that it is taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh be taken; and let it be ground much with some fat, and let it be placed upon the hip, where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it be left for the quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the infirm person feels a lessening of the burning. Then introduce him into the bath.
Therefore, when his body becomes moist, introduce him into the bath. For the pain recedes, and it is healed.
And know that it is not necessary that anyone use a cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cautery is done in this way. Let wool be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and is closer to the ankle.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat it. Therefore do not cease doing this until feeling comes to the middle as far as the ankle, and the pain rests.
And this method of cautery is called vaccinum cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and indeed cautery is not appropriate except in this type alone, which results from the infusion of cold material.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul-smelling pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient’s almeida, after marking with encausto five cauteries in each line, or more according to the amount that the patient’s tolerance and strength allow: and the cauterization should be done with a punctate cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medial nail cautery, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the beginning of humpback.
This illness often happens to small infants.
And the sign of its beginning in boys is that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find in the last vertebra of the back and its knots that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this form.
And let the cautery take equally upon every part of the vertebra; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware lest you apply the cautery to the hump which occurs in a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and the pains of the joints.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which are poured out into any limbs of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name this properly gout.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of healing and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that he cauterizes it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the remaining joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize it above each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, with this same nail-shaped cautery.
If, however, more are necessary to you with this cautery, then cauterize it. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back: then administer what we said of the cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are in the hands only, then puncture around the wrists, as two lines are rolled around.
But if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every node a puncture, and above the ridge of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not deprive the patient of good regimen, of the reception of medicines. For if good regimen is done, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary that you order the patient to omit eating on his day. And that he use emollients, so that stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and instruct him to hold his breath, until the bladder or intestine emerges or appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture on the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which is of this form, until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or bladder to its cavity. Then let the assistant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the legs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and another servant over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery on the mark, your hand with the cautery standing straight. And hold it until you reach the bone with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the bone with it in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and there comes upon the patient through it either death or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be slender, according to their size.
Then treat with other ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment for the length of time of his cure, which softens his bowels, so that the intestine does not come out during straining and evacuation.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be lessened from labor, and from repletion of food and drink, and from loud voices.
For when he uses this regimen, thus he is healed with a complete healing.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be then as a third of it. Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
And now some early authors have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with a branding iron, and a line is placed which is across the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with a nail-cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in some member from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every member be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it heals from the first cauterization, it is well. If not, then repeat the cauterization on it.
For it is customary for these pains to move from one member to that which is near it. Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with cautery, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Lepers, however, are sometimes helped by cautery with the greatest benefit. And especially the type of leprosy which occurs because of the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
Therefore if the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not subside, nor remain static: and you fear for the patient, that corruption will spread over his whole constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, markedly, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
And lastly, apply your hand with the cautery lightly, until it imprints a small mark on the skin, and the crusts are loosened from it: so that the exhalation of thick vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize also with a cautery over the spleen itself, as has preceded.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the al-hahos [? - unclear word in original] near the coccyx and one above it, in the almeidati [? - unclear word in original]: and two on the hips: namely one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, of the joints of his fingers, and toes: and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are on the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you add cauterization, the more it is helpful, and the more it contributes.
And know that the patient does not find pain in cauterization, as healthy people find it: because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints: according to what preceded in the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with herb flour with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in numbness.
When a limb is numb, and it is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and it is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what the size or smallness of the limb deserves.
And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes something causing numbness, which happens to the hand and foot, is cauterized in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Truly, let no one presume to do this except one who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Chapter 51.
When the albaras is of long standing and nothing from the arts of medicine benefits it, then cauterize it superficially with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with herb flour, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part; let these all be mixed, and spread on a cloth, and applied to the place, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cancer.
When a cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled.
The wise, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle.
But to me that does not seem good; because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen that happen several times.
And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adultery.
When someone has an abscess, and it is slow in maturing, either because of the superfluity producing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is decrepit and has little blood, or because of the time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the abscess, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing. Then leave it. For it itself will hasten with maturation.
But if you wish its perforation with a cautery, then a fire cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the abscess, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirmity, so that the flow of pus may be alleviated.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer.
Chapter 54.
A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption in a limb that moves about and corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore if you see a corroding ulcer in a place which can tolerate cauterization with fire, then have many fire cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place in which the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing at all of it remains.
Then leave it for three days, and apply crushed sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the eschars and all the corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Therefore if you see that after three days flesh grows in a healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And a corrosive is sometimes medicated with a sharp medicine. For it arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help: and I indeed have already spoken of its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore accept it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Clavus and Verrucae.
Chapter 55.
This ailment often happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a coarse, hardened thing which harms the foot.
And cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for that with fire, make a concave iron cautery similar to a vulture's feather:  made of iron, according to the size which contains the clavus on all sides; and let it have thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the clavus. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the clavus, until the cautery reaches the depth of the clavus: and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it at night. Then it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with an ointment generating flesh, until it is healed.
But if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then administer to them a cautery with warm water: and it is so that you take a tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it over the clavus, or althelul. Then throw into the tube a small quantity of warm water: hold your hand, and you revolve it with the compression of your hand a little, so that the edge of the tube is imprinted in the root of the nail, and the warm water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little for the biting of the warm water for one hour.
Then dismiss him, for the nail is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one after another, until you come upon all that are among them in the body.
Then care for them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
When tremor happens to someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, upon the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and upon his stomach a cautery.
For tremor rests with olive cautery, and the health of a cold illness hastens.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul things are expelled in the body, that is, pustules, which are made from gross corrupted materials.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized over the whole head of the pustule with a subtle cautery using myrtle wood, the end of which is lit with fire. Or with the root of long birthwort. Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized in the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the superfluity making them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Very often a flow of blood from an artery occurs, which has been cut in a wound, which happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to stop it.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it hard, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Then put small olive cauteries in the fire, and many more large ones: and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire.
Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood is stopped.
And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and some other harm befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods. Or with a cautery, as we said. Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is stopped. Or it is tied with a strong ligature of thread. Or medicines possessing the property of stanching blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a suitable constricting pad.
But he who administers its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of cauterizing agents and the like, does not completely benefit him, except rarely.
But if this should happen to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present: then he should begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have related, and constricting it strongly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery. And the finger should not be removed, but the wound should be constantly washed with very cold water until the blood congeals and thickens, and is cut off.
And meanwhile he should consider what he needs from cautery or medicine.
Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter, every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
And I placed chapters there from head to foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: that the seeker may be relieved concerning his request.
And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter is something terrifying, that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, caution is necessary in it more vehemently, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often falls, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or healing of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and things like these: with all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death falls upon many of them.
And I warn you, lest that fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes there fall to you in this art kinds of men with kinds of illnesses. For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is light to him: because of the vehemence of that which he finds from his illness and the length of its malice. And with illness is fear which signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such. And let your caution be greater than your greed and your avarice. And do not presume upon anything of it, except after certain knowledge, which verifies with you that to which a laudable outcome has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognosis and indication of that to which health is suitably directed.
For in that is for you help in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration: because that is in His hand.
And I indeed have arranged this Chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: that the thing which you wish from it, and which you need, may be lightened for you.
Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this infirmity very often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife binds the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this sickness in others than in children; and to everyone of them whom I saw, death hastened: therefore it seemed to me to leave the operation in it.
And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased, until he died.
And this moisture indeed, either gathers between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone upon the dura mater.
And the operation in it, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with one cut in width: and let the length of the incision be about two finger-widths, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the shape of the spatula.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this shape.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand inwards, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this manner.
And after the incision remove all the moisture. Then bind the incisions with cloths and powders. Then apply to it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then untie the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equal tightness. And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is greater in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the filling of water appear to you: and incise it according to what is possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs happen to someone in the eyes or in the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not help: then the last treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient should shave his head. Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. Then the patient should bind his neck with any cloth of his. Then consider where the vein pulses. And the places of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Then mark with a cautery on each: and incise each with a sharp spatula on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and incise it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when a vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsatile flow, which leaps inwards with a frequent leap.
But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers. Then mark with a cautery, and cut to the bone.
And that which it is necessary to let out of blood, is six ounces and perhaps you let out of it more, or less. All this according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the infirm and the repletion of his artery.
Then consider the wound. Then if anything of the sifac remains at the bone, then incise it, lest a hot abscess occur: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic headache, or acute catarrh because of acrid humors and heat in the temples, or chronic headache, severe, and similar to these, and it is treated with methods of medical treatment and it does not help: then we have experienced in these illnesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.
And the method of operating in their extraction is that the patient should shave the hairs which are in the temples, and point to the artery appearing in the temple. For it is shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
But if it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth. Or steam the place with warm water, until it appears to you in manifest appearance. Then take the spatula, which I formed a little while ago. Then scrape with it the skin easily, until you reach the artery. Then throw a hook into it, and draw it upwards, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it escape from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
But if the artery is small, then wrap it with the end of the hook. Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and that no flow of blood occurs. For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not entirely ascend.
Then evacuate blood from six ounces down to three.
But if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk or of alhod cords, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures. Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife-cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in the place of the same work.
And it is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever or is of a heated complexion. Because cautery is among those things which help to end humidities. Therefore it is a better aid.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that the place be filled with old lint, and that properly made pledgets be placed upon it.
And after resolution it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen cloths, until it is healed.
But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand until the blood is cut off. But if none of these things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood clots. And bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness ceases, and bind it as is necessary.
And of what is lighter and easier in the extraction of an artery, it is to cauterize a vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be like an almond. However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives. Because if they are sharp, like two knives, coldness quickly affects both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed. Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: therefore this work is better than all work, and lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of the cautery.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with a cautery: and place both very hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is lengthened. For they do not completely consolidate with this cautery.
Chapter IV.
Concerning the treatment of sharp, constant flow of tears from the eyes.
When there are constant tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull, and nothing of the medicinal cures with medicines helps in them, and you see the face of the sick person already reddening, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are thinned, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion, and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients needed in their cure this operation, and they named it a cure with the knife.
And it is, that you should order the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead. Then incise three equidistant fissures on the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles, and the third from the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are on the two sides: and lengthen your hand from the continuation of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and let you have a prepared piece of sponge, or much dried cloth, with which you will dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which the following is soon the form. From the incision which is from the part of the temples, up to the second incision: and flay with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the periosteum, which is over the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side. And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh connected with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should be continued up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, cleanse the places of the clots of congealed blood.
Then place in every fissure a pledget of old linen, and place over them pledgets soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar. And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the ligature, and administer a copious infusion with warm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment and other remedies with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
Chapter V.
Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from the interior of the head.
When sharp, acrid, and persistent catarrhs affect someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their sight already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, accompanied by sneezing: then understand from these occurrences that those materials and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the best treatment for these is this. And it is that you should instruct the patient to shave his forehead. Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or a slightly longer one laterally, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right; and let the incision reach the bone; and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during mastication, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old linen or linen threads. Then bind it above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you unbind it, and you see that the hot abscess is diminishing, then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regime that causes flesh to grow: for example, if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a flowing substance, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal.
When, therefore, a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from among those which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if then you see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil. Then manage its extraction, and make him sneeze with sneezing powders, and block the nostrils at the coming of the sneezing, after you place around the ear pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
For very often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then manage its extraction with forceps, that is, fine tweezers: whose form is this.
If therefore it comes out with forceps, it is good.
And if not, then manage its extraction with a small, thin, blunt hook.
If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a cannula of bronze, and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear deeply, and plug what is around the cannula with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except through the cannula: then extract it with your strong suction.
For very often it comes out with what we have described. But if it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbat, or birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the end of a probe after you have neatly wrapped cotton around it: then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with everything that we have described, then hasten to incise, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is that the phlebotomist should first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw out blood from him according to the measure of his strength. Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments you can.
Then sew up the incision immediately, and treat it until it heals.
But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
But if it does not obey you for exit, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this form.
And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is alleviated.
However, in the case of water entering the ear, the infirm person ought to use sneezing with the head inclined first: and then he should fill his ear with a little old lint: and he should lie on the ear in which the water is. If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, about the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the infirm person insert one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. Therefore let him not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
And then the water comes out so that you take from papyrus, or from a rush, one, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned. Then repeat another rush, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and draw it out with a tube as was previously described for the stone.
But in the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which is apparent to the senses: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all things held in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun. If therefore something of worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with thin hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates: then suck with it with strong suction. Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then seal around the cannula with wax, as I said in the case of the stone.
And if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer distillations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring out of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Therefore let that which pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula be made decently of bronze. And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap cotton around its end with a neat wrapping: then pour oil, or juice, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the rod with the cotton from above, and press it with your hand with moderate compression, until the oil is impelled into the concavity of the hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear, should be heated a little with fire: and beware lest the thing that is distilled into it be very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter VII.
Concerning the care of obstruction happening in the ear.
Sometimes certain infants come forth from the wombs of their mothers imperforate.
And it has also happened to some men that there is obstruction in the passage of the ear from a wound, or from flesh grown there.
And this obstruction sometimes happens in the depth of the opening of the ear, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens near the exterior of the opening, and sight reaches it.
Therefore that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which sight does not comprehend, is in most instances difficult of healing.
And in that which sight reaches, it is necessary that you place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see the apparent obstruction, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is this which follows, let its extremity in which there is a certain small width, a certain part of which is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a thin hook, and cut it with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the obstruction is in the depth of the ear: then take a slender, smooth probe, and heat it a little with fire: then insert it into the passage of the ear.
If therefore you feel the obstruction with that which the sick person finds with difficulty of hearing, attempt its opening with ease: and beware lest you injure the nerves of the ear.
Then put into the ear a pledget according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take a pledget, and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle on it powdered vitriol, and use it.
But if you see the ear already festering: then it is necessary that you remove the pledget, and leave it with another pledget, which you will wrap in cerate which is made with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs: then immerse a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the flow of blood, mentioned in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of a sty on the eyelid.
Chapter VIII.
These styes which occur on the eyelids, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps: or with a hook, and to incise them with a spatula from their roots. Then place crushed vitriol on the locations.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision. For many times they return when something remains of their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of the hailstone-like growths of the eyelid.
Chapter IX.
Very often something happens in the eyelids which is similar to hail in its strength and hardness, and on account of this it is called hailstone: and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation on them is that you should then consider if it is a hailstone which projects from the eyelid, and moves in every direction, and its matter is easy.
Therefore make an incision upon it lengthwise. Then scrape it from every side easily until it comes out. Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient in some way.
But if the fissure is large, then bring it together with a suture and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it. For ointment restores it and causes it to grow flesh.
And if the hailstone slopes towards the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the hailstone with a hook, except that you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that does no harm in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water, and treat the place with that which causes it to grow flesh, until the patient is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is fat which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid; and it happens most to children; and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and therefore you see them lying down on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which inflation has now covered; and the prominence of the axirnath indeed is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the patient should put his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare lint in it, and make from that lint a circle according to the quantity that contains the axirnath on every side. Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the axirnath may be gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then make a cut in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions in width, and let not the incision be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut the whole skin, until you arrive at the axirnath; for in many dispositions the axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore draw it out with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers to the exterior: and you turn your hand to the right and to the left, until it is dispersed: and beware, lest you add to the incision, so that you do not arrive with the lancet to the eye, and injure it.
But if the axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you shall add a little to the incision with ease, until the axirnath comes forth. Then draw it out, as we have said.
Then submerge cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind it with powders.
And there are some men who grind salt, and put it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may be liquefied.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if it happens in a place of a hot abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it happens that it is wrinkled as it ought not to be.
Chapter XI.
When superfluous hairs are born in the eyelids beyond the course of the natural hairs, and grow old: then they harm the eye, and cause various sicknesses to happen, such as continual tears, and softening of the eyelids, and albugo, until it becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.
And indeed Ataxmir of the eye is cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire. Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was premised in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture. Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom. Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good. And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula cutting from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct.
Then remove the thread, and place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark above the eyelid with a cautery, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape is made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because it varies in men.
For there are some who need a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount which is softened from the eyelid.
Then with a spatula incise upon the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a ray.
Then introduce a hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then flay it completely. Then bring together with a suture the two lips, with a needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what is superfluous of the threads to the two eyebrows, with certain sticking things, if you wish to do that: and if not, do not care.
Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days: afterwards treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts. For the eyelid is raised at the closing of the wound and its bringing together: but the future will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment, Ataxmir.
However, there is concern about the patient, and it is from good surgery, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, separated or joined together, according to this form which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct: and join the threads together between your fingers with evenness.
Then raise your hand with an even elevation: and raise the skin upon which the mark has been made, as we have narrated.
Then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: and care for it until it heals.
If however an abscess should occur at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cerate, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs are turned.
Therefore it is necessary that you use what we said in the incision: but suture is more skillful for both. Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is so, that you should turn back the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have related. Then skillfully make two canes, or two slender pieces of wood: whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spathula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully bring each over that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two canes from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. For the skin, being constricted, will die, and will blacken, and will putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then treat it until it is healed.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two cannulas, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII.
Concerning the elevation of hairs pricking in the eye with a needle.
The operation in that is, that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then you bring together its ends, and tie each with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place in the Alinxotati another fine thread under it shortly, and knot its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and be near the sun so that the operation may be clearly seen: because it is a fine, or small, operation.
Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull out from above a natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotati: and insert into the Alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the Alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not emerge with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the Alinxotati emerges from the upper hole, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then indeed you will pull the Alinxotati and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres in its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it with it; or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, arises from the healing of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you should split that consolidation, and separate its lips, and place between them a pledget of linen, and bind it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use in its treatment things which dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which mallow has been boiled, linseed; and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil; and wrap it with a pledget, and treat it with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all your skill that it not consolidate according to the form which it had at first.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return completely to what it was.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs below, is that which is truly called Alxatrati. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And accidental is caused by a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is, that you take a needle, in which there is double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread arrives at the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with a needle, and incise it with a broad spatula. If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: until when they are joined their figure becomes this figure, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its lower sharp side, from that which follows the eyelid. Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with a linen thread.
Then treat them with what we have spoken of, with softening medicines and linen cloths, until they are healed.
And if an abscess occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what preceded. Then separate the two lips with a linen cloth, according to what we said.
And the sum of the discussion of the treatment of an abscess, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to what is prepared in the form of an abscess.
For it itself is of many diversities in form: and a skilled craftsman prepares the means however it is possible for him, until he restores the form to its natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
Chapter XV.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and raise it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not with the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were scraping off that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or instill into it from a sieve made, from ziniar dissolved with water.
Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place on the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use a sieve, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that a nail is according to two methods. Or it is sinewy: and it is similar to hard, thin parchment. Or it is not sinewy, similar to congealed white moisture: which when iron touches it, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fix in it.
And both kinds do not begin except from the larger lachrymal duct, until it gradually goes, until it covers the sight, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on its incision is: that the sick person puts his head in your bosom. Then open his eyes, and lift up the eyelid with your hand. Then collect a small fold of the growth with a hook, and extend it upwards. Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the growth: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the growth with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the growth which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair to its end.
Then incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that a constant flow of tears may not result from its incision.
And sometimes the growth is extended with a hook alone; or with thread, as we have said. Then scrape it with a smooth spatula, of which this is the form.
And beware lest the spatula touch the cornea, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye some crushed salt, or something made from  *zinziber*, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it with what is appropriate, until it is healed.
But if the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the section.
But if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the patient, and take a thin, smooth spatula of weak sharpness, according to this form. And shave the nail from above carefully and skillfully. But if you see that it is rarefied and broken, and the shaving impresses upon it, then instill from your hour into the eye a preparation made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt, and cover the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation on it until all of it is removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye contrary to this: for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Then repeat the operation on it with a razor until it is healed.
However, if the eminence of the fleshy tear duct causes great harm in the eye, suspend it with a hook and incise a part of it; and do not extend the incision, lest the flow of tears be affected.
Then instill into the tear duct red copper sulfate or something made from verdigris, until it heals.
Concerning the incision of Albucasis, and the flesh growing in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes a red, fleshy growth arises in the eyes of men, either superimposed or covering the pupil, or approaching it, or constricting over the eyelids, and perhaps inverting the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a wild rose.
And the operation in this is also that the patient should place his head in your bosom. Then open his eyes, and gather up all that flesh with hooks suitable for it; and hold it with one forceps, or pair of forceps.
Then incise the flesh at first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel. And beware of the eye, lest you injure it during the operation; and let your incision, by which you incise it, be either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the nail; or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and all the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or instil into it red powder, and things similar to it from corrosive medicines; and place over the eye externally cotton with egg white: so that it may be protected from a hot abscess.
But if some of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with that which allays an abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which occurs in the eye from this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of any weak eye, from a natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron; and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the member is able to tolerate that operation.
Concerning the removal of a cataract from the eye.
Chapter XVIII.
Cataracts are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the eye from performing its function; and they weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is a cataract is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the cataract: then remove its cataract.
And it is [the case] that you instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a fine double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined together in one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors skillfully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and resolved; and beware lest you injure the eye with the points of the spatula.
And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red vitriol, so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sebaceous matter.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it at that time, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days, until its pain subsides and it is secured from a hot abscess; then repeat on it in the same way, until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the nasal bone.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the nasal bone a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what has preceded in its description.
And if it is not healed, then there is no remedy for it except to make an incision above the abscess at its origin, and to extract all the moisture and pus which is in it, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called a rasp.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which is pointed with a file’s point, or with a graver’s point with a subtle point: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone.
Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand gently, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident happens to it: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no way but to return the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this form.
And it is so that you uncover the second bone with an iron or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a trepan of this form, let its iron end be triangular: and let its wooden part be a pyramid tapering to the end, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the lachrymal bone: and move your hand a little away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the trepan until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this that he finds wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with drying styptic medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens: then the matter which was poured out to the exterior, returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter on the patient.
Concerning the reduction of a protrusion of the eye.
Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then you bleed him; afterwards you apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla. Then bind the eye from above with a plaster with many powders.
And the method of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth of them is doubled four times: make many of them: then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth a strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if the binding is again softened, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the binding after a day and a night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the tunic of the grape, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the powders, and the binding, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the grape tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture happens in the grape tunic, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grape seed, and the appearance of the man is disfigured because of it, and it is necessary to incise it: then the operation in it is, according to what I relate: and it is, that you introduce a needle into the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Then introduce another needle in which is a double thread from the lachrymal part, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the grape around the needle: and tighten it strongly.
Then withdraw the needle, and place over the eye wool infused in egg white: and leave it, until the thread falls with the grape.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the grape is constricted from every part with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large prominence.
Then let it be perforated with a thin spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and let the white humor flow, and let the eye descend, and let it enter immediately: then tighten it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This sickness which is called Alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
And the method of operating on it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Then take his head with your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes. Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and the light will be resolved: and the sick person will see things as he saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and pierce with it above the corneal membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the cornea, until the pus comes out.
When therefore it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already spoken of the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation by a statement declaring and explaining it; then take that same thing according to the health.
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and bind it tightly: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is the water, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the end of the almond near the cornea, to the thickness of a ray, in the apparent whiteness of the smaller lachrymal eye: then push the almond with force: and you revolve with it your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now arrived at the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and that is the cornea of the eye. For you will see them in the pupil itself, in the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then place the almond up to the place where the water is. Then press it downwards, one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his eye immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little. If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond comes out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almond with ease: and you roll your hand gradually.
Then dissolve in water something of clear gem salt: and wash with it the eye inside. Then place outside the eye a whole pledget, or wool infused with rose oil, and egg white: and bind with it the healthy eye.
But we, and those who are of our time, put on it crushed cumin with egg white.
But if the almond does not obey you to enter the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore pierce with it only the conjunctiva, and do not put your whole hand in the hole: and it is only that you make a subtle way for the almond.
Then introduce the almond, as we said.
And at the completion of your work, let a properly made bed be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be forbidden all movements, and coughing: and put his food that which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain in its position until the third day.
Then unbind it in that dark room, and test his sight: and make him see things. Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that he do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather it is necessary that he avoid it: because water rises quickly through strong staring.
But if a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you unbind the eye before the seventh [day]: and rectify it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed: then restore its sight, and place upon his face an eye-covering by which his sight is governed under it for some days, he himself being in that dark room.
Then let him go out from the house gradually, and converse in his own rooms.
And know that in the cautery the pupil is not excused from vision sometimes: then indeed let him dare to operate.
And now indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Al-Andalus, who said that there was made in Al-Andalus a perforated tube, by which water is sucked.
Truly therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has made that: nor have I read that in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of tubes, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made of bronze properly: and let their extremities be triangular with this same thinness, and the extremity pointed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Sometimes diverse fleshy growths are produced in the nose, of which some resemble a many-legged scorpion; and of these there is cancerous flesh, stony, dark in color; and of these there is that which is soft flesh, not dark in color.
Therefore, in that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into that flesh; then pull it outwards, and incise what you have grasped of it with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
But if something remains of it whose excision is not possible, then shave it with one of the fine instruments easily, until nothing of it remains. But if the blood overcomes you, or a hot abscess occurs, then oppose it as is necessary; or if it is of malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is cut off and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar and water, or wine, shall be thrown into the nose after the incision. But if the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now healthy.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it ought, then know that within it there is flesh grown in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then therefore it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and put between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less; and let the sick man contrive to send one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to azer; and let him draw his breath until it reaches the cavity and comes out over his throat.
And indeed boys often do something similar to this in schools; and it is an easy thing for one who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose. Then take and saw the flesh with the knots which are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread: and after wiping away the blood, put a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment into the nose: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then finally put a lead tube in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
But if it needs treatment that dries, use that.
To make a head-purge, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its channel similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purge should be full, uncovered; to which there is a handle at the end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you want from juices and flowing substances.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp grows in the extremity of the nose, and it becomes large and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it in the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. Then place on the location either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it becomes large, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark in color, and has little sensation: then do not touch it with iron; because it is a cancerous abscess.
For many times I have seen one who incised such an abscess, and great harm resulted from it to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the infirmity, and incise it without fear, without dread: and treat the location with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation contributes little in them, except in certain men.
Therefore, when something like that happens to someone, you ought to consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture: then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then it is necessary to scrape away all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds. Then bring together the two lips with suture, and bind them, and powder over it dragon's blood and crushed olibanum: and put over the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days. Then unbind it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suture is, to bring together the solution of continuity, either with needles, as we have related in the suture of the belly: or bring together the solution with thread, as I have made you know.
Chapter XXVII.
Concerning the extraction of knots of the lips.
Indeed, many people often have hard abscesses similar to barley grains in their inner lips; and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and incise over each knot, and suspend it with a hook, and incise it on every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with crushed alum, until the bleeding stops.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place should be treated with something astringent, until the wounds are healed.
Chapter XXVIII.
Concerning the incision of proud flesh upon the gum.
Often there grows upon the gum an additional fleshy growth which the ancients called abuluss.
Therefore it is necessary to suspend it with a hook; or to hold it with forceps, and to incise it at its root, and to let the pus or blood flow.
Then place upon the place crushed vitriol, or other styptic, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment—for often it does return—then incise it a second time and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Chapter XXIX.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Sometimes rough, foul crusts gather on the surfaces of the teeth, on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums; and sometimes they blacken, and become yellow and green, until corruption from them reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Therefore, you ought to make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth on which you see crusts and something like sand, until nothing of them remains; and similarly deal with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and the rest, until they are clean.
If, therefore, that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and a third, until at last your intention is achieved in what you wish.
And know that a tooth needs scrapers of different shapes and many forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; because the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared beforehand, as you see.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the extraction of aching teeth.
You ought to treat a tooth for its pain with all skill, and delay its extraction. For there is nothing to replace it when it is extracted, since it is a noble substance: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to extract it, that the aching tooth be made firm and secure for you.
For often pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in the sound tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not depart, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
For we have already seen this from the practice of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is made certain for you, then you ought to scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps on it with a good placement, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have now well held, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on every side easily, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then you ought to fill that hole with cloth: and bind it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you act expertly with scarification around the gum on every side abundantly.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the patient from it a malignancy which is greater than his first pain.
And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and boldness over its eradication, except that which we have narrated.
For very often they cause to happen to men great illnesses, which are more difficult to break, and its roots all remain, or some of them: or that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw: as we have testified to that many times.
Then let it be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
But if a flow of blood happens from the places (for it happens often) then pound some of zegi, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not benefit you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is moved at first, should have long ends, a short handle, thick, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied with them to the tooth: let them be like you see thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not give way to each other, nor bend: short ends, and let them be made of good iron, or of well-made steel, straight ends: and at their ends let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a decent, strong constriction.
And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the beak of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter XXXI.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
When, in the eradication of a tooth which breaks, something remains, then it is necessary that you place a poultice with butter on the place for one or two days, until the place is softened: then introduce into it a small hook, or forceps: the ends of which are similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork. This, however, is the form of the forceps.
Let their ends be made like a file on the inside: or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you cut into the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce an instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short at the end, somewhat thick: and let it not be soft, lest it break.
If therefore the root comes out through it, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular at the end, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular end, slender.
And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
Also let there be help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, of a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness, so that it is not broken: and let it not be soaked.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and a skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their types.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or rots: then investigate it in its place with that which is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gesti, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be tightened, or held with it, and not escape and go, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then shave it from its rottenness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
Concerning the sawing of teeth prominent above others.
When teeth project not according to their natural course, the form is made ugly by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider. For if a tooth has grown after another tooth, and is not located, or its sawing or filing is possible, then eradicate it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of untempered iron, very sharp at the end.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be done over many days, because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not disturbed.
But if it is prominent and exposed to filing, then file it with a file of untempered iron, of which this is the form.
Let it be entirely of untempered iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed little by little over many days easily, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls out; then smooth it, and finally shave it with some razors.
But if it is a tooth from which a part is broken, and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is leveled, and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
Concerning the binding of teeth with gold wires.
When a shaking and loosening of the front teeth occurs from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not been successful: then the method for them is that they be bound with a gold wire; because silver turns green and rots after a time, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount that it takes between the teeth.
And the method of binding is this: you take a wire and insert the doubled part of it between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether it be one or more, until you reach with the weave to a healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving to the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with delicacy and skill until it is not moved at all; and let your tightening of the wire be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with scissors; and join both together and twist them with pliers; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain thus bound.
But if it becomes loose or is cut, bind them with another wire, and it will remain in this way for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the method of binding two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the fall of both, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and this is done only by a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes something from the bones of animals is fitted; and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is supported and fastened, as we have said; and it remains, and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound which has already healed.
And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person on his head in your lap, and lift up his tongue: then incise that nervous ligament across, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
But if in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then throw into it a hook, and split it across, until you incise the ligament, and the knotting is released.
And beware lest there be a fissure in the depth of the flesh, and you incise an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then let the place of the incision be washed with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Then place under the tongue a linen pledget, which the sick person should hold throughout the night, so that it may not consolidate again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded alum on the place. But if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a sluggish cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it is magnified so much that it fills the mouth.
And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person before the sun: and consider the abscess.
If therefore you see it of a dark or black color, hard, to which the sick person feels no sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
And if it inclines to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw in it a hook, and incise it with a thin spatula, and free it from every part. But if blood overcomes you at the time of your operation, then put on it crushed verdigris until the blood is stopped: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the remaining appropriate treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat glands, that is, glands which resemble the glands which occur externally: and they are called the two tonsils: which when you treat with what we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then consider.
Therefore if the abscess is hard, dark in color, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures. And then either you will pierce it, or it will break by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it ought to be incised.
And the operation in it is that you consider before its operation if the heat of its abscess has quietly subsided completely, or is lessened by some diminution: then therefore make the sick person sit before the sun, and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth, and a servant should take [the patient's] hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, of which this is the form.
Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is thin like a little knife.
Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you pull something of the tunics with it.
Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form that follows. It is similar to scissors; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply: therefore take care that it is made of tempered iron, or imbued with alfuled.
But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a spatula, of which this is the form. Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you incise one tonsil, incise the other according to this same kind of incision.
Then after the incision let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if a flow of blood happens to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to them from among the styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then cure him, until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses are produced in the throat, besides the two tonsils. Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed once treated a woman from an abscess which had formed between her throat, which pulled towards blackness, little feeling, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a constricted passage, and it had already prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they came out above the two openings of the nose.
Therefore I hastened, and fixed a hook in one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the opening of the nose.
Then I did the same to that which protruded from the other nasal opening.
Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long period: and the abscess succeeded in the place of what I incised, until it became very long and with it that.
Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stopped from increasing; then I departed, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the incision of the uvular abscess.
Chapter XXXVII.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
And what is gathered from it, round, and does not have length, and is blood-colored, or brown, or black, and does not have sensation: then it is necessary to avoid its incision. For in it there is fear for the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described, from its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit facing the sun: and press down his tongue with the instrument, the description of which has preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula and pull it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I have described for the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise more of it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we have described in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and terror.
And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with a sharp instrument; and it is, that you place the patient's head in your bosom. Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned. Then take of the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it some quicklime not slaked, and put it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let the extremity of it in which the medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva may run from his mouth from within the medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat and injure him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you apply it to the uvula for the amount of half an hour, until you see it now blackened, and the biting of the medicine calmed.
And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the pledget with the medicine, and insert the spoon with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula.
Do this many times, until you obtain what you wish of the cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it: for it dries and falls off after three or four days.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and clean it of what remains around it of the medicine: and wash with cold water.
And treat externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further removed from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this way. Take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, sea-wormwood, chamomile, southernwood, and similar herbs: and mix all of them, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be properly luted with clay: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the uvula through a small tube, until the uvula is greatly obscured.
Then repeat it over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess. For it often adds to the abscess: and it is not fitting that you do it except at the decline of its warm abscess.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end an eggshell: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned: because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is among good treatments with safety.
Concerning the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or fish spine, or something else adheres in the throat.
It is necessary therefore that you extract whatever of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument towards the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the infirm person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach. Perhaps then the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the infirm person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread: or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it. When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
If therefore it does not come out with what we said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he may easily insert into his throat: and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough should befall him, and push the bone or spine with it, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
But that the sick man himself inserts it, this is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or draw his hand upwards with the instrument, all of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When the leech is medicated with what I said in the division concerning cure with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick man before the sun, or by the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Therefore if your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps decently.
But if it is not possible with them: then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick man as far as the throat: then insert into the concavity of the cannula iron heated with fire. Do this many times: and let the sick man abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand. For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
But if it does not come out with what we have narrated, then fumigate the sick man with bugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I narrated in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, because it itself will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then throw in the fumigation, and let the sick man put his mouth to the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech. For the leech will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and not drink water.
Therefore it is necessary that it come out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon the sight itself.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat. And its extremity is similar to the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter XL.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to what comes to mind of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and incision of them in two ways.
One of which is from the species of the abscess itself, and that which it contains of humors.
And the second method is because of the places in which it happens in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And among abscesses there are some which it is not necessary to perforate except after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and among them there are some which it is necessary to perforate while they are raw, and not matured according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or there is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that member, or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end that which is not healed.
It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess which has matured according to completion: and that is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and the other signs.
And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more vehement prominence: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and lastly in all equal places, in which there is no reflection.
However, in those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its lips and its depth harden.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body when necessary: or according to that which the member needs.
And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation: or many incisions according to the likeness of the size of the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out: and incised when it has become like a cloth, and has reached the point that it is dead: as that which happens in many, like boils and buboes.
And some of them are those which are cut with a three-angled incision. And some of them are such that it is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the abscess of the groin.
And some of them are those in which a round incision and a lunate incision are administered: and similar to them among incisions.
However, that which does not have a head, such as are soft superficial abscesses, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial or only flat perforation.
And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you do not hasten and extract all the pus at that time: rather, extract a part of it from it. Then pack the abscess until another day. Then extract something of the pus again.
Do this many times gradually, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person; for the animal spirit is often dissolved from the body with the exit of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Beware therefore of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider. If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply a linen cloth, or old lint. And if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is necessary that you insert into each fissure a linen cloth, until they meet together.
And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around: then it is necessary that you fill it with old lint, or as when cloth is woven, or is shaved with flax lint without moisture: and bind it up until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and apply it to the place of bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places of this our book, and from the division.
But if it is in the winter time, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse little bags with warm wine and oil: and place them on the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place little bags soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all that cold. Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the path of distinction however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment in summary individually.
Chapter XLI.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the skin of the head.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the species of Nodes, which contain tunics, which are sacs for them: as if they themselves were the wattles of a hen.
And their species are many.
Some of them are fatty; and some of them contain a humidity similar to mud; and some of them contain a humidity similar to phlegm and porridge; and similar to them; and some of them are hard, stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, provided that an artery is not injured during their incision.
And the operation in their incision is that you should explore them with an instrument, the shape of which comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if that which it contains is humidity, then incise it with a superficial incision along its length: according to this form.
And begin the incision from line b. to line g. When therefore the humidity is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that humidity, and do not leave any of it at all.
For very often it returns, if any of it remains.
Then dip a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day. For it will corrode what remains of the cyst.
Then repeat upon it with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty nodule, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the form of a cross: and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it from every side: and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
And similarly do in the case of an abscess, if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier, because it is of little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, with which there is altogether no moisture.
That is: because I cut into an abscess in the head of an old woman, and I found an abscess like a solid and hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken; and if anyone were struck with it by throwing, it would wound him.
In other abscesses however occurring in the head, besides these namely abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of pustules in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those which occur in the neck, there is one, and many; and they are generated from one another; and every pustule among them is within its own tunic, as is the case in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the types of these pustules are many. And some of them are stony; and some of them contain humors; and some of them are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one which you see to be of good disposition to the touch, whose color is clearly close to that of the skin, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the gullet, nor to an artery, nor is deep: you must excise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b. to line, g. and flay it from every side: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is important to be cautious, lest a vein or nerve be cut.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp: lest it slip in your hand during the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is unnecessary.
But if you cut a vein, or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put crushed alum into the wound, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to fester.
For the blood is stanched.  Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then investigate with your index finger if something remains of other small pustules; therefore incise them and cleanse them.
But if there is a large vein at the root of the pustule: then it is necessary that you not incise that pustule from its root; indeed it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen, which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment. Then take care of it.
If the entire pustule is incised, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew it up immediately, after you see that absolutely no excess remains.
But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then it is necessary that you aim at incising its root, and extracting it: and administer the suture which we have described.
And which of the pustules contains moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the location of its ripeness appears to you: and place the perforation from that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer after the perforation a pledget with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound to be already cleansed: then take care of it with an ointment generating flesh, until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
The ancients said that this incision is in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
However, in those having quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis ought to be avoided: since no help is done by it; because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In those, however, who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in the two tonsils, when there is no illness in the windpipe, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis, to escape from the loss which happens from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do it, we must incise the epiglottis below the three circles of the epiglottis, or four, with a small incision across, in that which is between two circles, by an amount such that the incision is in the fat, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is convenient for the incision, since it is without flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
But if the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he should split the skin until when he arrives at the windpipe: he should avoid a blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the fat which we have described: and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is broken, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis. The sum of this discourse which we have narrated is not explained except when they see that some of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the sick person: and the sick person is close to death, and his breathing wants to be cut: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe through the place of the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and on account of this they ordered the wound to be left open, until the malignancy of the sickness is consumed, and its malignancy is for three days, and as it were itself: then therefore they ordered the wound to be sewn, and to be cured, until it is healed.
And that which I saw by myself is that a certain maidservant took a knife, and put it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the windpipe.
And I was called to her cure, and I found her roaring, like the roaring of the dead.
I uncovered therefore the wound, and found the blood which had come forth from the wound to be small. Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the gullet: and wind was coming forth from the wound.
Therefore I cleansed and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state of her affairs.
Hence therefore I say: that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Chapter 44.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
And it is according to two methods: for it is either natural: or it is accidental.
In the natural certainly there is no skill.
Accidental, however, is according to two methods: of which one is similar to fatty nodes. And the other method is similar to an abscess which is made from the knotting of an artery. And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that presumption be made to it with iron, except in that which is small: and you probe it, and investigate it with a probe. If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not suspended with some vein: then cut it, as nodes are cut: and extract it with that which contains it of a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it. Then treat the place with that which is necessary of treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.
Concerning the incision upon kinds of nodes.
There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I relate here the difference between a Node and an Excrescence, since it causes doubt.
I say therefore, that when an Excrescence is hot, and feverish, and with vehement pains, until the boiling over of superfluity is settled, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and heat cease.
With a Node however there is neither heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in a sifachin cyst, which is its own sac, and is according to the colour of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a date, and larger and smaller.
And they are according to two kinds: either fatty: or containing humidity. And the colours of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
It is necessary therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a Node, that you examine it, and investigate it first with an instrument which is called an Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is after this.
And the method of investigating abscesses, and all Nodes is, that you take this instrument, and insert it into the most humid place, which you find in the abscess: and you roll your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin. Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which comes out in its track.
If therefore a running humidity comes out, whatever color it may be: then cut it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses.
And if no humidity comes out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore cut it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and keep the cyst if you can over it, so that you extract it whole with the Node.
But if the cyst bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns all the more.
But if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place over it what sits hot abscess, and care for it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Therefore if the Node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with that which causes granulation.
But if you have a pulsating or non-pulsating vein opposite: then hasten, and fill the place with crushed zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood ceases: then return to incising what remains of the Node.
Chapter XLVI.
Concerning the instruments for incision and perforation.
Of these are the shapes of the intromittents, and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one.
Let them be made of alfulud iron with square ends decently, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the perforating instruments, and one of them is called beris, that is, perforating: and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating by means of them abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citrine, or of bronze, or iron, or silver.
And better are those which are made of citrine.
And probes are also made of black lead, which are suitable for probing fistulas, whose cavities have reflections, so that they may be gently reflected with those reflections.
And again they are of three kinds. For of them some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the size of the fistula and its stricture.
The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
For some of them are simple, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And of them there are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And of them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and of them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three kinds: for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small.
Their ends with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not made thus, except that with them help is given in the skinning of nodes for fear of cutting a vein, or a nerve: and that the sick man may be healed by them, and find tranquility for a little while from the burning which he finds in the skinning of an abscess.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a spatula with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is a hidden spatula point: and it runs into the interior, and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The form of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be thin.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be at hand, large and small: so that you may quickly cut off blood by means of them when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them in the cutting off of blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the flesh of the leg, and hip, and flesh of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar fleshy, moist places.
And sometimes small instruments are made from them similar to the husks of figs, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or from the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
Chapter XLVII.
Concerning the care of the breasts of men which resemble the breasts of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain badly inflamed.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, it is necessary that he cut above the breasts with a lunate incision, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then flay all the fat. Afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine. Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it heals.
But if the nipple declines downwards, and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be incised on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the shape of a crescent, each of which is joined to the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards flay the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about the suture and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
But if you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the patient's unease, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a pledget soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat. Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the nipple.
Chapter XLVIII.
Those abscesses which occur under the nipple are of the hard kinds of strophulus, which contain cysts, and of those which contain humours.
Therefore those which contain humours ought to be cut with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line b to line g.  Then when all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then fill it with old lint and leave it until another day.
Then let the lint be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
But if the abscess is of the kind of the nodes of strophulus, then incise upon it, as we said in the section on strophulus equally.
But if the wound extends so that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what was previously stated.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and vein.
When an artery is broken and the skin which is over it is consolidated, then an abscess often occurs from this; and similarly it happens to a vein also, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are because of an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is because of an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when you push the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking in it.
And that which is because of a vein is round in the evident part of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is a mistake, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large. Therefore its treatment with iron must be avoided, and that which is also in the extremities, or in the head, must be avoided.
Therefore, upon that which is of them from the swelling of the opening of the artery, make in the skin an incision in length. Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is uncovered.
Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it is healed.
But if there is an abscess because of a section of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible for you of the abscess with the skin. Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side. Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of a grape, on two sides with two ends of thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until when that which is in it comes out: then incise the superfluity of the skin, and leave that which is tied from it.
Then place on it a small cushion which you have submerged in wine and oil. Then administer the treatment, which is done with linen cloths and ointments, until it is healed.
Chapter L.
Concerning an abscess which happens from the twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess happens in nerves: which happens in them through percussion, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things; and it happens most in the places of the joints, or heel, and in every place in which the joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in most instances without pain: and when it is squeezed forcefully, the patient feels in it a sensation similar to numbness.
And it is not an abscess gathered deep in the body, rather it is under the skin, and it itself moves to every part, and does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the posterior.
Therefore, what is among them in the joints, ought not to be invaded with iron. Perhaps, indeed, contraction will happen.
But in that which of them is in the head, or in the forehead, split the skin with a spatula. If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and close the wound with suture: and treat it, until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens in the belly.
There happen to some men oftentimes in their bellies, and in the other parts of their bodies,  thelil, which are called Fungals, by their similarity to fungi.
Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted. And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
And indeed I myself saw a man, and in his belly were two thelil, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, small-rooted, and their lips were inverted, and they were split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Therefore I cut them, and found in one about eighteen ounces in weight and in the other about six ounces.  And the operation in cutting them is that you should consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelil is white, moist, small-rooted: then cut it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be in your presence in the fire.
For very often much blood is expelled in its section: therefore hasten, if blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
But if you see the patient fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a neatly made lead thread, and bind the thelil with it: the method of which we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the binding of lead. Therefore do not cease to bind with lead, as often as it presses on the thelil, until it is cut off, and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the thelil is of a thick root, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread; especially that which is in the belly.
Nevertheless, it is possible that you incise half of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then take care of it, until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to incise a thelil which is of a dark color, little sensation, foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I will come with a remembrance of Cancer after this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of the umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia happens from many causes. Or from fissures of the fascia which is over the belly; and from it protrudes fat or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures. Or from blood which flows from a vein or from an artery, as was stated before. Or from wind constricted there.
But if it is because of a fissure of the fascia and the protrusion of fat, then its color is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain; and it appears in diverse locations. And if it is because of the protrusion of intestine, then its location, with that which we have narrated, is of more vehement diversity. Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is much magnified at the entrance of the bath, and vehement labor.
If however it is because of humidity, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor constricted, nor is anything added.
But if it is because of blood, then with these signs an abscess appears tending toward blackness.
But if it is because of  newly grown flesh: then it is a serious, large, hard abscess, and is fixed according to a single quantity.
But if it is because of flatulence, then its touch is soft.
And the operation in that is, that you consider then, if the prominence of the navel is because of blood from an artery or vein, or flatulence: then you must be forbidden from its treatment. For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of abscesses because of an artery and vein.
But if the prominence of the navel is because of the intestine or a hernia: then you must instruct the patient so that he holds his breath and stands upright and extended. Then mark with a cautery around the whole navel. Afterwards instruct him to lie on his back between your hands. Then surround with a broad spatula around the navel above the place which you marked with the cautery. Afterwards extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook. Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a strong silk cord: and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature. If therefore you find it already seized by the ligature: then pull it out, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find a hernia, then seize it with a hook, and incise its superfluity.
But if an artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it much. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then bind the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls by itself: or incise it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
But if the prominence of the umbilicus is of raw flesh in it, or of moisture: then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we said. And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with that which solidifies the place.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken in the division of the species of cancer, and how there is a way to its cure with medicines: and caution should be exercised with its treatment with iron, so that it may not be ulcerated: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the womb, and caution about its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar to them, from the members located so as to extract all of it: especially when it is small in the beginning.
When however it becomes old, and is large, it is not fitting that you approach it.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it: nor have I seen another before me who has arrived at that.
And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is that you precede, and resolve the diseased area from black bile several times. Then you should bleed him if you find him with manifest repletion.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is positioned for the operation.
Then throw hooks suitable for it into the cancer. Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to the exploration, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but rather press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops. Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54. We have already recounted in the division the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone: and it does not approach with iron the type of tympanites: nor the type of anasarca completely: for that is mortal.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider. For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or has another illness besides dropsy: such as if he has a cough, or diarrhea, and things like that: then beware lest you treat him with iron: because that is dangerous.
But if you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation on him is that you raise the standing patient between your hands, and an assistant behind him presses his abdomen with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form. Let it be two-edged, long, the sharp end like a spatula. However, let there be some shortness in it gradually, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation as far as the intestine, and injure it.
Then consider. For if the generation of dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubis.
But if the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then pierce the whole skin with an instrument. Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin and the fat, as if you are flaying it; and let the amount that is flayed be the amount of a fingernail, or about that.
Then pierce the fat until the spatula reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water. Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, whose form is this. And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which in its lower part has a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side: and its end is incised, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the sick person dies through the dissolution of his animal spirit: or a syncope happens to him which approaches death.
Truly evacuate from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the conditions of the sick person signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from the goodness of it.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is, because it is immediately retained because of the skin which retains the opening which is above the sifac: of which I have spoken, that you should perforate it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the next day, if you see the sick person tolerate it: and also draw out from the water a small quantity.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains of the water only a little.
But if you fear for the patient, and you leave a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and the sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have narrated in what preceded.
Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urinary places not perforated.
Chapter 55.
When an infant emerges from the womb of its mother, and the opening of its penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately upon birth with a very thin spatula, according to this form.
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening and bind it: and keep it for three or four days.
When he wants to urinate, it should be removed, and he will urinate. Then replace it.
And if you do not put lead there, it is possible that the urine flowing over the place will not allow it to close.
But he whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
Those, however, in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured. That is because, of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis; wherefore he cannot urinate forwards, until he raises his penis with his hand upwards. Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in this case is that the patient is laid on his back. Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and incise the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp point, or a sharp spatula: just as is the incision of a reed, or as you shave something, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as is proper.
And beware in your operation of a flow of blood. For that often happens. Therefore apply to it that which stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning Albucasis, what happens in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These things often happen to the penis according to Albucasis, and it is a protrusion of foul flesh.
And of it, one is malignant, and another is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and you should cut it away until you clean it entirely. Then place upon it lint soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
But if the Albucasis is malignant, of foul colour, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and shaving.
But if the Albucasis is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the Albucasis is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albucasis which is inside first, until when it consolidates, then treat the outside: because when you treat it together, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And now blackness and corruption also happen in the testicles and foreskin. Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out all that which is already blackened, and that which wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then spread over it afterwards with honey which is already mixed with the flour of pomegranate rinds, and of crushed, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood happens, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For a cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary that you insert into the meatus of the penis a tube of lead, so that the sick man may urinate over it.
However, in the adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
But if it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin. That is because, when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then it should be treated with astringent wine, until it is consolidated.
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the cure of accidents happening to them.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; nevertheless, since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it a better operation, and a more gentle way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
That is, because I have found most practitioners and phlebotomists use cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery, and ligature with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I have found none better than cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, very often the skin escapes. Because the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to a further incision to incise the other, and future pain. And with cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a cauterizing instrument which suture-makers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured: because perhaps it enters its opening.
In cleansing however with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes, and spoils your operation: and indeed a boy's skin is short in nature, and very often they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
But cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread, a good experiment revealed to me: because scissors are proportional in incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below. Therefore when you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they incise according to one operation in one time: and a compression is made with a similar figure, containing the skin of the penis from every part, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is that you cause to be shown, a boy especially, if he is one of those who understand a little, that you do nothing except that you tie a thread on his penis only: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way that is possible for you, from that which his understanding receives. Then make him stand between your hands in a prepared posture, and let him not be sitting: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Then insert your hand to his penis, and inflate the skin, and draw it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges. Then cleanse it from the filth that gathers in it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread. Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with a good grip, and incise between the two ligatures. Then raise the skin upwards quickly, and draw out the head of the rod. Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which the yolk of a boiled egg has been spread in rosewater, beaten with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on until the next day: and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Now the shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them meet: lest a nail-like projection extend from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
An error occurring in cleansing is: because perhaps the whole inner skin, or a part of it, escapes at the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend it with your fingernail before suppuration of the place: and incise it evenly.
But if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then draw it out with a hook, and incise it.
But if three days pass, and what is under the rod remains inflated, suppurated: then leave it until the warm abscess settles, and flay it easily, and incise it as prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod. For that will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper parts, that also will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned in the divisions of treatment.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient be bent over on his knees. Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as possible. The neck of the bladder is thus forced, with the stone, towards the posterior, wherefore the urine is released.
But if it is not released by what we have said, and the matter is serious for the patient, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird’s feather in the thinness of a ray, long like one and a half palms; to which there is a slender tube at its head.
And the method of the urine’s exit through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good ligature; and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if anything of the wool is superfluous, but introduce it into the tube forcefully, like an auger.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white; and make the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and its neck with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the neck easily, until it reaches the root of the neck.
Then bend it upwards from the part of the navel.
Then push the syringe inside it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has already reached the empty thing; and this is not done in this order, except because the passage, into which it goes, is one which is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. For the urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage; and repeat with the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter 59.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is constricted in it, and it is necessary to instill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with an instrument which is called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed. And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave place, in which is that which impels, should be according to the quantity which fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, the moisture is drawn: and when it is impelled, with it it is expelled far away: according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha is thrown, that is, Greek fire, in the battles of Mars.
Therefore, when you wish to throw moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with that which impels to the upper parts, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then insert its end into the tube, according to what we have described in the syringe. Then impel the moisture with that which impels it; for that moisture immediately arrives at the bladder, so that the infirm person feels it.
The form of a slender clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Let it be made of silver or brass:  its head should be higher, similar to a small bowl, and below it a sinus into which a ligature falls.
Then take a ram's bladder and put into it the moisture with which you wish to clysterize the bladder. Then tie it between the two sinuses with a strong ligature using double thread, and warm that moisture slightly over a fire.
Then insert the end of the clyster into the penis, afterward squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with a proper constriction, until the patient feels that the moisture has already reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and perforate it throughout its circumference. Then insert strong thread in those holes, as they are rolled up. Then gather the circle, as the alsofratu is gathered: after you put into it what you wish of moistures, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter LX.
Concerning the extraction of the stone.
We have already spoken in the division of the types of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have spoken of the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of it all: and I have spoken of the stone in which operation with the hand and incision falls: and it is the stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am relating that with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the sick man rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often it hangs down. Then it is raised, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the healing of children is easy, until they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in old men. But in young men it is moderate, in that which is between that: and the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier: and if small, the care of it is the opposite.
Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is necessary first that we cleanse the patient with a clyster, which draws out all the dung that is in his intestines: for this sometimes prevents the finding of the stone on examination.
Then let the patient be taken by his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or rise from a high place sometimes.
Then make him sit prepared between your hands, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a full-grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place, of which you wish to make an incision: and order the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another assistant to raise the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand to draw back the skin which is under the testicles on the side of the place where the incision is to be.
Then insert the cutting spatula, whose form is this. And make an incision in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the quantity that the exit of the stone from it may not be greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know that of a stone which has angles and edges, therefore its exit is difficult on account of that.
And of that which is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Therefore to that which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
If it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you operate on it: or bind it with a suitable bandage, whose extremity is like the moon, which binds over the stone, and does not escape from it: or that you insert under it a thin instrument, of curved extremity.
But if you cannot [do this] over it, then enlarge the opening a little. If something of the blood overcomes you, cut it away with a scalpel.
But if the stone is more than one, then push the largest first to the opening of the bladder. Then incise upon it. Afterwards push the small one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut upon it with a large incision. Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or there happens to him a constant dripping of urine, because the place does not completely consolidate.
But manage its expulsion until it comes out; or contrive its fracture with forceps until you extract it piecemeal.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloes, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place upon it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or with rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess may settle.
Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day. When therefore you have loosened it, bathe the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and corrosions, and things like that: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from flowing out: and this is known from the passage of blood with urine. Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood. For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply to every kind with that which is suitable from the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the whole treatment, that you bind the two hips together, and bring them together, because of the medicines which are placed on the place.
But if the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prevented: then treat it with what I relate before you arrive at incision. For many times you will be excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proved it.
And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, whose form is this, of a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie with it the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the penis easily, until the perforator arrives at the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually: and attempt its perforation, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis. For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the sick man is healed.
But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something which prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures. Then extract it. Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
And the ligature of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other ligature above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to raise the skin upwards, so that it returns at your completion, and covers the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Concerning the extraction of a woman's stone.
A stone is rarely generated in women.
But if a stone should happen to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for many reasons.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
And a second is, because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or one of those having husbands.
A third is, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And a fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity compels to it, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
If however you lack her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a well-taught midwife skilled in women's matters, or a woman who understands some part of this art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her to do all that you prescribe to her from the examination concerning the stone.
First, it is that she should look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should compress it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the sick woman, and to investigate concerning the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression.
If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the greatest of her strength, until she arrives with it at the hip joint.
Then she should cut upon it at the juncture of the middle of the vulva at the hip joint, from whichever part it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, compressing under it: and let the incision be small at first. Then she should insert a probe into that incision.
Then she should insert a probe into that incision. If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the types of stones are many. For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its types, so that it may be signified to you by this concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place of the zegi, crushed, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and do so that you prepare with you of the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it with a decent bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it. Perhaps therefore the weak woman will die. Then treat the wound.
Therefore when the sharpness of the blood has settled after days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
Chapter LXII.
Concerning the incision for watery hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white fascia which is under the skin containing the testicle; and it is called fascia.
And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in part of the egg, until it is considered: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white fascia, which we have mentioned; and this does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them. And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color inclines to yellow, or it is red like blood, or fecal, black, or watery white, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these. For if it is in the white tunic which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own tunic, then the abscess is round with part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunic, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form has preceded. According to that therefore which comes out in the track of the inserted [instrument], judge concerning that which is between it.
When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the patient, that he be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left, and order the assistant, that he sit on his right, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the flank of the abdomen.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubis: and let the incision be made according to the straightness of a line equidistant which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white fascia enclosing [the testicle]: and flay it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your flaying with which you flay it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly explore with the flaying according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the fascia full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the fascia upwards, and do not touch the skin enclosing the testicles: and incise the fascia however it is possible for you to incise it, either in its totality, or piecemeal, especially its thin side. For if you do not exquisitely search, in its incision there is no security, lest the water return.
But if the egg proceeds outwardly from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the fascia, return it. Then unite the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you find the egg corrupted by blackness or something else, then it is necessary that you ligate the vessels which are the suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut away the testicle with the suspensory, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
But if water has collected in two parts, then know that there are two roots: therefore cut the other part as you did the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood. And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the scrotum: and place on top doubled cloths, which are compresses: and bind them on top with a bandage which is six fingers wide in this manner.
Then take two cloths, and sew them, and fill them with carded wool, according to this likeness: and make ends which are pressed with tow, or damp wool: and gather them with a bandage in the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end should reach over the anus to the back, and the second should reach to the pubic region: and two ends below over the two hips, and two other ends over the two groins, and let the whole bandage be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this fistula is treated surgically with cautery in place of incision with iron: and it is so that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have described: until when white fat containing water is revealed: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to a Greek letter.
Then perforate that fat with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then stretch the fat with hooks, and scrape it with a thin, heated cautery, and incise it as much as possible, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
But if a hot abscess, or bleeding, or something else opposes you during the incision, or during the cautery: then it is necessary that you treat what opposes you with the treatment that is appropriate to it, as has been previously stated.
But if the patient is timid, and does not await this operation because of its horror: then administer perforation as I relate it: and it is.
When it is ascertained by you through what we have said about the signs, that the abscess is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then put a pledget over the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may run out: then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the egress of water at the time when you perforate it: and this is only because a white membrane makes opposition in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary that you introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsies is extracted, the form of which has preceded: or add to the operation of the wound a little.
And know that the water returns, and is collected after six months, or thereabouts. When therefore it is collected, then let it be perforated in the same way, and the sick person will pass his days.
Chapter LXIII.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Know that in the incision upon this fistula, there is fear leading to destruction in many instances. Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from it.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely.
Or from an acute or sharp superfluity which is poured out to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and the abscess is serious.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens from the knotting and swelling of the arteries, as its mention has preceded; or from the swelling of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from the swelling of the arteries is known by the disposition of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers. And it is not necessary to touch it completely.
That, however, which happens from the swelling of the veins, does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers.
And now it is possible that an incision be made upon this kind and upon the remaining flesh; and it is to cut the skin of the testicles. Then extend the testicle upwards, and draw it out with the tunica albuginea; and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and ligate the vessels; and incise the spermatic cord after you free it from every part of the parts of the testicle.
If therefore the testicle is consolidated with those newly grown  fleshes, then it is necessary that you draw out the testicle, and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between something of the tunica albuginea, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and draw out the testicle, as we said.
When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter LXIV.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas, which is with a vine.
A vine is a swollen abscess, involved in a certain involution, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Truly it is necessary that we speak of the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat. Then push the suspensory of the testicles downwards. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels which are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with a strong extension.
Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula with a transverse incision in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are revealed.
Then flay from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Afterwards fix in them a needle in which is a double thread, and tie it in the first places where the veins meet: and tie it again in the last of them. Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from foul, corrupted humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall away. For there is no harm through it.
But if a vein affects all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted with the vessels on account of this: lest the egg be deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and waste away, or dry up, and there be no help with them.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal fistula.
The outcome of this fistula is from a section which happens in the sifach extended over the belly in the groin region from the mirach of the belly.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles. And this rupture is either from the sifach, or from its extension.
And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach. Is that it happens gradually over a long time, and it does not happen suddenly: and there is an equal abscess towards the depth: therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes a vehement pain suddenly from its beginning: and the abscess is different, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the sifach.
And sometimes zirbum exits with the intestine: and this is called intestinal Ramex, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes excrement runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and with it is the ruin of the infirm; because it causes a bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this illness with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the infirm to return the intestine with his hand to the inside of its concavity, if it obeys return. Then he is laid supine upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise. Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be of such a size that, if possible, the egg may come out of it.
Then flay the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphak is uncovered, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and absolutely loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand: and with this extend the white siphak upwards with your left hand: and lift the egg with the siphak to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you loosen the adhesion which is behind with complete solution.
And search with your fingers, lest there be something there of the intestine involved in the hard white siphak. But if you find something of it, then push it downwards to the belly.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it at the end of the siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads. Then arrange some of them over some in the form of a cross: and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until it cannot send anything to them from the vessels which nourish them: so that a hot abscess does not result from it. And place another ligature again outside the first ligature, less than two fingers distant from it. And after these two ligatures leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut away all the rest according to the roundness, and remove the testicle from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles with an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we have related in what has gone before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the ligature which we have described. And sometimes the white siphak which we have mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing the flow of blood. For this often happens. And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be moistened with warm water: and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Concerning a cupping instrument with a nozzle.
In this cupping instrument I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have narrated in the cupping instrument which is with a tube. That is, to tie the vessels after the incision upon it with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall out: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Chapter 67.
Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groin.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all hours: truly if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And this happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said. That is, because the sifach is extended; then it softens, and the place suppurates, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its account preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lies on his back between your hands. Then cut the place of the rupture of the abscesses and the protruding part, with a cut across, according to the amount of three fingers.
Then constrict the alsifak and what are under the skin, until when the white sifach is uncovered, which is under the skin which follows it.
Then take a radius, and put it on the place protruding from the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew two prominent places on the end of the radius from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then remove the end of the radius.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal fistulas.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds. Therefore, when you cut the threads, clean it and dress the wound until it heals.
For the sisach contracts, and no prominence is added to the rupture.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to healing.
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked about its treatment to make the sick man lie on his back, and to cut away all the skin which is softened down to the natural skin.
Then he should bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Then incise between the sutures.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
Concerning castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and because of that it would be permitted to me not to mention it in this my book: and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he should know the treatment of him to whom it happens.
And the other reason is that we very often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit thereby, such as rams, he-goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition. Or by fissure and incision.
Now in that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch.
But in castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut above each testicle with one incision, until when two testicles come forth: then incise them after you have skinned each one, and do not leave on them of the sifak anything except the thin sifak which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then take care of the wound until it heals.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the care of a hermaphrodite in two ways.
A hermaphrodite from men is according to two ways. One of them is that which appears in that which follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one type, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubis like very small male testicles, projecting outwards: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three types, two from men, and one type from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears. Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second type of men, however, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Chapter LXXI.
Concerning the incision of condyloma, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Condyloma perhaps is added to a natural thing, until it is defiled and its appearance becomes foul: and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much, until it expands as in men, and it arrives even to coitus.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of condyloma with the hand, or with a hook, and incise: and do not be excessive in the incision, especially in the depth of the root: lest a flow of blood occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Flesh, however, which arises, is flesh which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it goes out to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: and because of that some first name the illness a tailed illness. Therefore it is necessary that we incise it as we incise condyloma, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, the imperforate vulva of a woman, or a small opening. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from a preceding illness: and it is indeed made either from added, newly grown flesh, or from a thin membrane, or a thick one: and it occurs either deep in the womb, or on its sides, or in its upper or lower part: and it prevents intercourse and conception, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
And its recognition is made by the inspection of the midwife, if the obstruction is apparent and near.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane, and is near the two lips: then hasten, and break it.
And it is so that you place pledgets on the two lips.
Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and the woman should be on her back with her legs spread. Then spread the two lips forcefully until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the area: and let the woman have intercourse every day, so that the area does not heal in another way.
But if the membrane is thick, then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is of fleshly origin, then suspend it with hooks and incise it: and have with you medicines which stanch the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense combined with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, keep it in place for several days: and administer a tampon of dry linen, then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes the birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be incised in this manner: provided it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, must never be counteracted with iron at all.
Chapter LXXIII.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubea in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the orifices of the veins, until much blood flows from them constantly.
When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become thelil: and I have already spoken in the division of their species, and their signs: and I shall say here which of them receive treatment, and which not.
I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the sense: then there is no treatment for it with iron.
But those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which sensation falls, are those which are cured.
Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house. Then extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then pulverize over them at the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without mastication: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Then let her push her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water.
But if the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and galls, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over her back.
If therefore blood is drawn off with it, it is good: and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarthith, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth however is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of a rough appearance.
Therefore it is necessary that you incise what appears of it, according to what I said in thelil equally: and treat it, until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIIII.
Concerning the perforation of the Exitura which happens in the womb.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and a stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And I indeed have already discussed all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is of the abscesses which gather pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider. Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if feeling falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which aids in maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which has two seats, and she is reclined, or she is laid on her back, and she brings her feet to the lower part of the belly: and her hips are spread, and she puts her arms under her knees, and she ties both with a suitable ligature for that.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix with a probe the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak woman.
But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place pledgets on the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb is prevented: and it is necessary that she places the rotating part, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that she holds the instrument, and that the assistant rotates the rotating part, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a pledget submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some styptic quality: and place the pledget, and extract the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb, and over the vulva, clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is clysterized with water and honey: then with water in which the root of lily, or long birthwort has been boiled: then it returns to the ointment.
But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment with iron, nay, treat it with that which we have said in the division.
Chapter 72.
The teaching of obstetricians, how live embryos, having emerged according to a non-natural form, are to be treated.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the form of natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman being compressed downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and that which is upon her of the birth is lightened, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities with a good cleansing.
But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned upon its neck, and similar blameworthy forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, skillful in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and what its nature is, and let it be signified by that, and let her attend to it.
When the fetus exits head first in its natural manner, and it becomes strenuous for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and vaporize her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with warm oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and let her break the secundine with it, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it of moisture flows out: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the clyster, that she be compressed; and make her sneeze with a conserve, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. For the fetus will exit immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you gently and gradually return them. But if it does not obey in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upwards; then shake the seat upon the ground; and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall upon shaking.
If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies, then incise them, and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with a cloth, and extract it evenly: for it will come out.
The exit of the embryo upon its feet. When the fetus comes out upon its feet, then it is necessary that you push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards straighten it.
Then let him take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they come out as far as the hips, then instruct him that it be compressed, and make it sneeze with sneezing powders: for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have narrated, then return the fetus gradually, until you place it according to its natural form. For it itself will then come out with an easy exit.
But if it is prevented with all that we have narrated: then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with good pounding: then anoint with it the woman's vulva, and the lower part of her belly. Then make her sit in warm water, until it reaches her hypochondria.
Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh: and insert it. When therefore the pessary remains for one hour, then make her sit on a seat. Then make her sneeze: and pinch her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure. For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands. When it comes out in this way, then he will succeed in inserting his hands gradually. Then the woman will be laid back on her neck, and her feet will hang downwards; and she will be lying on the bed, and she will clasp her hands. Then press on her belly gradually. Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows, until she is prepared in the lower part. But if the fetus does not come out, then take its feet and move them with a strong movement. Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. Then let him insert his hands and gradually level the fetus: and instruct the woman to bear down, until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands. His hand will be used in the reduction. But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
If childbirth takes her, then make her sit on a seat. Then strive to reduce the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with its hands outstretched, and its face is towards its mother's back. The midwife ought to hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually rotate it and adjust it easily.
When therefore it is adjusted, then place on her vulva what we have narrated of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move gradually. When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean to her right side. Then instruct her to bear down; and make her sneeze with sneezing powders.
The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side. When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated of moisture.
If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then incise it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place it as is necessary: and instruct the woman to bear down several times: for it will itself come out easily.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses. Know that twins are frequently born; and sometimes three, and four are born. However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Five, however, is outside of nature, and they do not fully live: and a single secundine contains them, however many they may be: and they are separated by a sifach, distinguishing between them, bound in the umbilicus of each of them.
And sometimes they exit as a single fetus exits by a natural, easy exit; and they exit by a blameworthy exit, as we have narrated.
But if some of them are difficult at birth, and they arrive at that which we have spoken of from unnatural forms, then treat them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with speed and slowness, and let her devise according to every form with that which is prepared for her from skill leading to health.
A recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and is aborted.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified by me, that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of midwives. For perhaps something similar to that will come to her: therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter LXXVI.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division concerning medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head be inclined lower, and her legs raised: and a servant should hold her from two sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the os uteri with moist oils with marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed mucilage.
Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her insert it into the womb with ease. Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix hooks on the fetus, and suitable places for it.
Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is on its feet, then in the pubis and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty thing.
Then let her fix in opposition to it another hook, or a third, if she needs: so that the contraction is equal, and does not lean to one side.
Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every part, so that its exit is eased: as is done with a tooth at its extraction.
And it is necessary that that which is between them be softened for the extension. But if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may roll out with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand comes out before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it. Then pull it out until, when it comes out completely, you incise it either at the joint of the sole or at the elbow; and thus you must do in the other hand and in the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction happens to it in the exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that she insert a spiny spatula between the fingers and split the head with it and draw out the water; or break it with the instrument which is called *Almisdac*, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similarly, if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary that you cut the *algengematu*; or pull it out with *misdach*, as we said. Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is constricted at the fork, then let it be split until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not entangled, nor does it yield to exit, then cut the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
But if there is an abscess in the lower part of the belly, or if there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary that you pierce it until the moisture runs out of it.
However, if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with the cloth which you have wrapped around your hand, and split the belly or chest until that which is in them runs out.
But if the remaining limbs are removed and the head remains, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand into the depth of the womb, and search with it for the head, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot abscess which has happened to it, then it is not necessary that labor should be undertaken upon it; rather it is necessary then to administer the effusion of humid, oily things and apply plasters; and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be straightened; then let that which we said concerning a living fetus be administered.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piecemeal and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave absolutely nothing of the afterbirth inside.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning hot abscesses which occur in the womb.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then let her sit in astringent waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And I indeed have already seen a woman in whose womb a fetus died; then she became pregnant over it another time, afterwards another fetus also died. Therefore, after a long time an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore I was called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Therefore I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out of the place. Then several days passed, and another bone came out. Therefore I wondered at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I examined the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she now lived in this way for a long time, and emitted little pus from the place.
And I did not confirm this unusual thing, except because there is knowledge in it, and help for that which the skillful physician administers with the hand in the treatment.
Chapter LXXVII.
Concerning the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus.
The form of the spindle by which the matrix is opened.
Here below is the form of a constrictor, by which books are bound, which has equally two spindles at the two ends of two pieces of wood. However, this spindle ought to be more slender than the constrictor: and it ought to be made either of ebony or of boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers: and the border of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fastened to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you revolve the two spindles.
Another form similar to that one, more slender, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two digits.
When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her legs hanging down, open that which is between her legs. Then insert these two joined additions into the womb: and you are holding the extremity of the instrument below between her hips. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
The shape of another speculum than the ancients described, the shape of a pusher by which the fetus is pushed.
The shape of the Almisdac, with which a large head is crushed: and it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is oblong, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which it is cut and crushed.
The shape of a hook having one point.
The shape of a hook having two points.
The shape of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
The shape of two spatulas, also broad.
All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the more highly regarded among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore you should not despise any of these instruments, but have them prepared at hand. For their necessity is inexcusable.
Chapter 78.
Concerning the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you ought to instruct the woman to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils. If therefore it comes out by this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and sage, and cassia lignea, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said. For the afterbirth will come out easily.
But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search for the afterbirth with it. When therefore she has found it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and pull it out gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall during forceful pulling: rather it is necessary that it be moved easily to the right and left sides: then let the amount of pulling be added. For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with medication from the pot with herbs.
But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself over it in repeated extraction.
Truly it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the woman's hip. Then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment. For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and it harms the weak woman. Therefore, suitable fumigations ought to be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, however, have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated in the retention of the secundines and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of brass; and let the wide end be placed over the fire; and let the fumigation be placed on the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
Chapter LXXIX.
Concerning the cure of an imperforate anus.
Many boys are born, and their anuses are imperforate, whom a subtle membrane has already obstructed. Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil upon it. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wishes to defecate.
And now, obstruction of the anus also happens from the healing of a wound, or an abscess. Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with what we have described in the treatment and lead.
Chapter Eighty.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part are a knotting and a swelling which occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one finger; and it is one fistula, or several.
When therefore that knotting becomes old, it opens, and a watery white moisture or thin pus flows from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out with the excretion and flatulence, when the sick person uses excretion; and perhaps a worm comes out of them.
And some of these fistulas, when they are penetrating, reach as far as the bladder and as far as the urinary passage. And some of them penetrate to the hip joint and to the coccyx.
However, what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from one that does not is that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula made of air or iron, when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
But if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything like excretion, flatulence, or a worm, as I said, come forth from the opening, then know that it is not penetrating; therefore, hasten to the treatment.
And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus, then its sign is the exit of urine from it, and this prevents the place from being consolidated with medicines.
If, however, it penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone; and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus always exits from it; and that medication is not effective in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is absolutely no cure; and their treatment is labor and vanity for the foolish physician upon whom it is performed.
However, in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven it: and it is so that the patient lies on his back between your hands; and raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly. Then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
Therefore, if you feel the probe has already penetrated by itself through the fistula, besides what you feel between your finger and the fistula itself, or flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor over it, since there is no cure for it, as we have said.
However, it has been said that in some men the flesh heals, and for the medication by which help is hoped for it is that you heat a thin cautery according to the size of the fistula, as preceded, and insert it burning into the fistula until it reaches around the anus. Then repeat this twice or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered, flesh-like tissues, which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, are now cauterized.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those cauterized tissues come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it never heals with any other treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or fat, and you see a fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe that is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
But if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those tissues, then it is better, and of quicker help, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire brings together good conditions, the burning of those added tissues, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of humors.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, or with crushed cabbage leaves, until the place emits pus, and those burnt tissues come out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, generating hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you do not fear a recurrence.
But if a fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is elongated from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a probe, and between you and it is a covering of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said: or to cut it away, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint, and treatment from nearby. And do not proceed far with the incision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and there happens to the patient an involuntary discharge of excrement. Then treat it with what we have said.
For perhaps it will heal: or you will lengthen that covering, and cleanse it after you have cut it  almost to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity. Then cleanse those filtered tissues which are in the incision, as far as you can with exploration.
Then attempt the repair of the whole wound with an incision and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes a fistula is sewn up in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is at the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe of perforated extremity, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, of those preparing leathers, according to this form. And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and around it. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its depth.
If therefore it penetrates into the margin of the anus internally nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together: and tighten both, and leave it for one or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshy parts which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall away: then care for the wound, until it is consolidated, and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep. For it is not in your power to do this because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatulite with a spine by which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter LXXXI.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the care of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are according to two methods. For they are either within the anus, similar to bladders of coals, or plums; or as if they themselves were grape seeds. And of these there are small ones and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many. And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows a yellowish water, or a little blood with a constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you instruct the patient to strain: and it is pressed out, until it leaves the anus, and the athelil appear to you. Therefore, also suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your nail. Then cut them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a pledget of woolen cloth, and pull them out with your fingers. Then incise them, and sprinkle on them after incision some warm powders, that they may stand in place of a cautery. Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization. Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if the anus does not obey evacuation, then give the patient an enema in which there is a little mordacity, so that what is in the anus may be washed out with it, and it may obey evacuation quickly, when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is that you seize them with your nail, or seize them with a hook, and incise them. Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever avoids incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method. Take a wound thread, and insert it into a needle. Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the hemorrhoid, and let them be lateral: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong binding. Then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor tie it, so that an excess of blood may flow from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cerate, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures. For they often happen from the dryness of the stool and the constriction of nature.
Therefore, when they become old and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail, until they become moist and the upper layer which prevents them from healing is removed from them. Then treat them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal, then repeat the scraping with more force than before, until they bleed much and are excoriated; then treat them until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil and formica.
Chapter LXXXII.
Know that almirmar is nothing but a round nodule, the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and pain from them occurs when walking.
Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut, and held with forceps or a hook, and eradicated from its root.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, there is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence on the surface of the body. And they frequently occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you extend the athelil and incise it: or bind it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now inverted and uninverted athelil are eradicated with the instrument which I shall describe.
An ant, moreover, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold finds it, something similar to the biting of an ant is felt in it, and it happens throughout the body: and it occurs most frequently in the hands.
And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose quill, or a strong vulture quill: and place that tube over the ant, until the circle of the tube contains parts of it. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant: and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
And if you wish, do that with a bronze or iron tube, according to this method.
Let the top of the tube be of a height drawing a rolled-up stopper, so that its grip and its rotation on the finger may be eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant as was previously described in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter 83.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for the loosening of the bowels, and for colic.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast or hammered bronze.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in whom they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and of those whose anuses are weak or painful, so also should their enemas be.
A large clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner: and it should have a distinction so that the bag may be tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a point: and on one of its sides there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
And let the size of the opening be according to the thickness of the fingers, and a little thicker, and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be made of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be in the shape of a small asofrat, whose root is one palm.
And let it be perforated with many holes as it is rolled up, and let the space which is between each hole be the thickness of a finger. Then insert into those holes strong thread of raw flax, which consists of ten threads, or thereabouts, and sew with it the bag like an asofrat. Therefore, when the bag is placed in it, let it be tied at the head of the clyster between two separating parts with a strong ligature. Then clysterize with it.
And this is the form of the circle of the bags here depicted, and of the holes.
The method of clysterizing with it is: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine which is warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and beware lest it be excessively hot or excessively cold.
Then the patient is laid on his back, and he raises his legs upwards; and place under him an inthaan, that is, a leather on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or the like. Then introduce it into the anus gently. Then let the attendant take the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until he empties all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall.
If the medicine causes him to evacuate, then let him hold it as much as he can. And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more effective in its help.
But if you give him a clyster for diseases of looseness of the bowels, and its evacuation is rapid: then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
But if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very subtle, gentle, from among those clysters with which children are clysterized.
And this is the form of a subtle clyster over which the skin is tight.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division concerning the treatment of wounds which was suitable for the book, and I shall here speak of their treatment with the hand and with medicines according to the completion.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore the things by which wounds are made are many times such as the throwing of a stone, or the incision of a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or wood, or arrow, and similar things from many things.
Moreover, wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or breast, or belly, or liver, and similar members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may put that reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore. When a simple wound happens in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and it has now broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear concerning the bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately bleed the cephalic vein: and do not delay this: and draw from him blood according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing is prohibiting phlebotomy, especially if the blood which flows from the wound is little. And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
But if something prohibits bloodletting, then let him reduce his food, and not approach meats, nor wines.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess happens to it, a cotum infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
But if you are secure from a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall relate shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by themselves, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I shall relate in the wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
But if the wound is already bared from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then incise it. Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as are heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge: and similar things.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise all the putrefied part, and throw it away: then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not cut off by medicines, then inquire about the artery. If therefore you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it. But if necessity demands when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
But if these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so that you sprinkle on them this powder: because it consolidates them before the air changes them.
Method of incarnative powder. Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be ground very finely, and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with powders, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it may not fester. For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes the lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood at hand; and the dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to apply it and bind it, and they are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially in summer, then this powder is not suitable: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you apply certain digestive ointments, or apply poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until they discharge pus. Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps; and I will now describe the treatment of head fractures in what is to come.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done except to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as ziniar and zegi, and similar things. Because they harm nerves and constrict them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most superior of the members; and what is used to treat it should be from mild remedies, such as lime washed with fresh water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutia, when it is also washed with fresh water; and other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures; or draw its edges together with powders. Then treat it until it is healed.
But if the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus has already gathered, then perforate it in the most depressed place in it.
But if an artery has already been cut in the wound, and a flow of its blood has resulted, then separate or cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole of it, have been injured, and the alhuadagi have been saved, then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the throat tube, and do not touch the throat, rather level it, and restore it to its natural shape. Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days. Then treat it with ointments which possess astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not prepared, leave it, until the wound becomes putrid, and its discharge is separated and lessened.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle upon it the powder which I have described. But if bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that whose mention came in its chapter.
Concerning a wound in the shoulder blades.
If there is a wound from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider. Therefore if wind escapes from the wound when the sick person breathes out from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor bind it up, lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick person: but put on it attractive ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
If however you do not have ointment at hand, then place old linen in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what comes out of it in the form of moisture: and make the sick person sleep on the wound, so that what gathers in it may flow out.
If however three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the sick person has not suffered spasm, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see his remaining conditions to be good: then know that the wound is safe. Therefore treat it with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
If however its healing is delayed, and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has now formed. Therefore treat it according to its own chapter.
And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has now made an impression on the bone, and fragments have fallen from it: then explore the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated. If however they are not separated, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, for their extraction is then easier.
Moreover, the judgment in the treatment of other accidental wounds in the other members is the judgment that we have spoken of.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestine, and their exit.
The rupture which happens to the abdomen is great, moderate, and small.
Therefore, from a great one sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, protrudes.
Therefore their replacement and their suture is more forceful and more difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way. Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in their replacement to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: therefore its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, on account of this, the middle rupture of ruptures is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Know that the suture of the vein is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen, and for the suture of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly belong to the other wounds. However, they are more proper with the suture of the abdomen: and I will relate to you each one with explanation and clarification.
I say therefore, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is due to one of two methods. Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we have said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone. Or boil in water squill, and cyperus, and spica, and bathe the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does that: and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow, or mallow has been boiled. For by that its entry is eased with a small thing.
But if its return is excused after this treatment, then cut a little in the rupture, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than section: and constraint to cut is not done after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part of it not sharp, and let the thin end not be with the thinness of a spatula, but rather be somewhat blunter: and it is that which resembles a cautery, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible on that: because it is better.
But when the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary that you administer that in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
But in small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Then arrange that a pious assistant be present between your hands, who holds the whole rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips. Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of the common suture of one.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound. Then leave from the extremity of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle except that you insert into it thread at two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the sifac which is under the skin from the interiors, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Then bind with doubled thread around the needle several times from two sides together, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with a decent binding.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix in them another needle: afterwards tie it with thread, as you did with the first needle. Therefore do not cease doing that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because thin needles very quickly cut the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: on account of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that a needle be fixed in two extremities of the skin which are very close: lest the flesh be quickly cut, and the wound be opened before its consolidation, and they not be lengthened also with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the end of the needles, so that they do not injure the sick person in his sleep: and place on them small cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the ends of the needles: and leave them, until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And indeed this kind of suture with needles is more suitable in small wounds. Because one needle, or two, or about that many, suffice in their suture.
The second suture, however, is common, so that you join together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia at one time, with a needle in which is wound a thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, return the needle from the part from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is, like the seam of a cloth with which cloths are bound together, and place between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with this suture I sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and there protruded from the intestines about two palms of the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I replaced it after its intestine had stood outside the wound twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space which was about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that many years, occupied in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was by a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment was found, nor anything of medicines. Therefore I placed old linen on the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
But I will describe two proper kinds of suture according to the account of the speech.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Therefore when the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle going according to the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end of the sifac on the side in which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other end of the mirach.
Therefore when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate accordingly in the same end of the mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the end of the sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration by which you make it penetrate in the sifac at the end of the mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end which is from the sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out of the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it into that skin, and sew the end of the sifac, which is on the other side, with this end of the mirach: and draw it out of the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it turn after turn, until you sew the whole outside according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is, that you sew the suture of the leather workers by which they sew hides: so that you sew the sifac once from one side with one end of the skin: and that you leave it another time from another side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
This speech of his is related, that you sew it according to the likeness, by which some physicians sew, so that they bring together each part to its own naturally fitting counterpart: and apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to its other end. And that is done according to what I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix the needle in the end of the mirach nearest to you on the outer side, and make it penetrate to the interior in that alone: and leave the two ends of the sifac. Then revolve the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part in the two ends of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Then reverse both, also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose mention preceded.
This is therefore also the word of Galen.
And some said. The suture of the abdomen is straightened with two needles. That is, to insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew hides equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
The judgment, however, of the medication of a wound, is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it: and you reduce the intestine, and its own [self], and you fit it: then place on it incarnative powder.
But if the air has already altered the wound: then place on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall away, and the sifac and mirach consolidate. Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
But if medicines are not present to you, then place on it immediately, from the time it begins to emit pus, old lint: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
For you do not need other medication in most instances, when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will communicate to the principal members in the lesion, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas which are between the groins, and under the armpits.
But if he feels pain, or pricking, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then clysterize him with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has become an exit penetrating to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small intestine is of more difficult healing.
But the intestine which is called the Jejunum, does not receive healing from a wound which happens to it at all: and that is because of its multitude, which is of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is a hernia, and you obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
But if a space has passed, and it has already become green, or black: then it is necessary that you constrict it with thread above the place which is blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not happen. For in a hernia are veins and arteries.
Then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its traction and extraction in the case of a hernia, and the emission of pus of the wound, may be alleviated upon you.
Concerning a wound which happens in the intestine.
When a rupture happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it may be restored in some men: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was made, and excretion and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore I applied a cure, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared for the patient, that some evil accident might befall the patient in his belly: and no evil accident happened to him from that. And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and he entered the bath, and exercised in his diets.
And now some experienced men have said that when a wound happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is necessary that it be tied according to this method. And it is, that you take ants with large heads. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound. Therefore, when it seizes upon it, and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and not become loose.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing that with ant after ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound. For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient.
And now it is possible that the intestine may also be tied with a fine thread: which has been wiped clean from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is much thinned. Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end. Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it. Then return it to the rupture.
And this method of suture with ants and intestine is only according to a way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except reduction, nor is its healing at all complete.
Concerning the treatment of zucumen and fistulas.
Know that every wound or abscess when it becomes old and ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not excised: then it is universally called a fistula, in whatever member it may be, and we call it zucumen.
And a fistula indeed is, according to the truth, a filtered, hard, white knot; with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather; and because of this some call it risati, that is, a feather.
And it is sometimes moist, which discharges pus. And perhaps the moisture is divided at certain times. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scanty; and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I already premised in the division, then when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of a deficiency of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it and its edges there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much dirt and filth: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is discharged from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or by a property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed there: or because in it there is one bone, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of fistula and zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that fistula occurs in all the members of the body. For among them are fistulas which reach to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the composite joints, such as the hand and the foot: and among them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore, which of these fistulas is according to this manner, is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is among the fistulas one whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
But if there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a slender lead probe. Because lead, with the softness of its body, is eased, and is bent around the tortuosity.
But if the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to ascertain it with a probe. Therefore, inject a clyster into one of its orifices.
For the moisture with which you inject it goes towards the other orifices, and flows out of them.
Then diligently inquire, in whatever way is possible for you, to know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is far or near; or whether it is a single fistula with many orifices, and attend to all this with the greatest strength, with your questioning of the patient, and finding of pain upon compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes happening to an abscess.
When therefore you have attended to all those things truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider then if the fistula is near, apparent, or in a safe place far from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the fistula as has been previously stated in my account, and remove what is in it of pus, and corrupt flesh, that which grows in its orifice from flesh or thelul, and the like; and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it deeply as much as is possible for you. Then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then apply linen cloths wrapped in sharp medicines; and insert them up to the cavity of the fistula which you have reached with the iron: do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it as we have described.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed to you: then investigate it, and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you, such as a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
If therefore bone is detected, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed. Then treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed, and emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore investigate it again, and carefully perform its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it. If therefore it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached. Therefore you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then skillfully perform the extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, something of the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision: then incise those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then put something on the wound that will cause it to putrefy: and leave it until that which is around those bones of flesh and humors is putrefied.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal. And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted. Rather, if you fear, put on it a piece of cloth dipped in crushed sulfur with oil: or a piece of cloth dipped in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those humors putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction are eased.
But if there is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar ones, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost care, until that blackness and corruption is removed. Then restore the wound.
But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated.
And I tell you, a case which happened to a man in his leg: that you may put it as an example and help for your operation.
There was a man, young in age, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior parts, until the materials reached the leg, and it became an abscess with a large abscess: and there was no external cause.
Therefore, time was extended with him through the mistake of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much material came together with it. And its treatment was postponed, until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and the humors of the body.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which flowed from those openings with a great flow: indeed, the whole body of the man was now wasted, and his color was yellow.
Therefore I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to connect to each other from all parts of the leg.
Therefore I prepared, and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now eroded, and blackened, and putrified, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I sawed what was uncovered to me, and prepared [it] from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was in the bone only that corruption, which I cut away, and sawed. And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time. And it is not consolidated.
Then I attempted, and uncovered the bone a second time above the first uncovering: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also of that corruption.
Then I attempted its restoration. And it was not restored.
Therefore I uncovered it again, and did not cease cutting the bone piece by piece, and attempting its restoration: and it was not restored, until I had cut away about one palm of bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this repetition in its operation, and section of it, was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because there happened to him at all hours from the superfluity of evacuation bad syncopes.
Therefore he healed with a complete healing: and firm flesh was born in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he lived in his dispositions: and it did him no harm at all in walking.
But if a protruding bone in a place of the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament, and tie it to the end of the protruding bone: and instruct someone, who extends it upwards: and place another ligament of wool thicker than the first ligament. Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, decently under the bone below: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be slightly over the corrupted place, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels another sawing in its place.
But if the bone is corrupted, and is not protruding, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part: and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely. Then place wood underneath.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part: and let the sawing be slightly longer than the corruption, according to what we have said.
But if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except abrasion.
But if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand, or in the metatarsus of the foot: then the matter is very difficult. Truly it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you. And abrade it, and clean it according to whatever method is possible for you, and with whatever instrument is rectified for you: when it does not oppose you, vein or nerve.
And know that cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity. Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable to that operation.
And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study. And the knowledge of the methods of this art, a witness to the methods of illnesses: then indeed you will find by yourself that which is suitable from the instruments for every infirmity.
And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place as examples upon which you will cut, and the proof by which you will test upon others.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of a joint rasp. Let the head of this rasp be according to the shape of the head of a star-headed nail: and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except to rub with it the heads of joints when they are corrupted, or a bone that is large and great.
The shape of a larger rasp.
The shape of a wide rasp.
The shape of a rasp in which there is a concavity.
The shape of another, slender rasp.
The shape of another rasp with a curved end.
The shape of a small, slender, thin rasp.
This is similar to a spoke, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places because of the nature of bones.
The shape of a rasp which is suitable for rasping that which has been perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, of sharp points.
It is made of Indian (material). And similarly it is necessary that all things which we have spoken of be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the cure does not help, and you see the corruption cutting into the member, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that member until where the corruption reaches, so that the infirm person escapes death by it, or the harm which is greater than the defect of the member.
And a sign that this happens is that the member blackens until it is thought that fire burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness until that putrefaction is incised up to what follows that member and creeps into the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the striking of certain poisonous things, such as a sea scorpion, and viper, and weasel, and similar things.
If therefore the corruption or blow is in the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it proceeds to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the forefinger, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint.
But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the infirm. And to administer beyond that from a cure, is a quantity of virtue.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints: and if it takes hold in the instep, then incise the whole foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except dismissal, and leaving the infirm to death.
And the method of incising a limb, or sawing it, is to constrict the ligament below that which you wish to incise: and constrict another ligament above the place. And let one assistant extend the lower ligament; and let another assistant extend the upper ligament upwards. And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is exposed. Then let it be incised, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw not touch the healthy place: and there may happen to the sick person an added injury, and a hot abscess.
But if there happens an internal flow of blood while you are working, then cauterize the place quickly; or place upon it certain powders which staunch blood. Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded member with a bandage suitable to it, and take care of it until it is healed.
And I tell you that which happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I tell you.
Which is, because there happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption at first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened on his own account, after he saw the corruption falling upon the member with its vehemence, which he found from its pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on the hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not wish that, hoping from myself concerning the repelling of that excess: and I also feared for him concerning the cutting off of his hand, death. Because the strength of the man was beyond measure.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and word came to me concerning him, that he had hastened, and had cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not related this story, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls under the type of this illness: and that it may be a sign by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas, and the manner of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it breaks, or is perforated, and that which is in it of pus goes out, and an empty space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has become thinned: and it does not reach the ultimate in its corruption, nor does it press upon bone, nor upon nerve, nor upon ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption presses upon any of these members, then it is called a fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is that you incise all that skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it has become thin, and made like a cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
But if you fear that the skin adheres, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster: and it is so that you consider the sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it is of foul odor: then clysterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is of vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, gathered in a vessel: and let them be decocted over a fire until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take of it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the sinus with it: and bind its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then draw it out by expression: do this for as many days as necessary, until the sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is so that you take the ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour water upon it. Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed. Or clysterize him with honey and wine mixed together, because it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine causes adhesion to the sinus, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus has now been removed: then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is, that you take of diachylon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or clysterize him with certain other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the sinus is constricted, so that the clyster cannula cannot enter: then enlarge it slightly with an iron instrument; or place in it a linen tent soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
And similarly if the orifice is too wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and leave of it an amount into which a clyster can enter without addition.
And similarly if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated to a higher position: then cut it in a lower place which is in it, so that the pus flows from it downwards: because pus, when constricted in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which the pus flows from it easily according to what is prepared for you. Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidating medicines which are placed on the wound, suitable to that which you wish. And spread them on a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such a quantity that the whole sinus is covered. Then cut with scissors in a straight line with the opening of the sinus a hole, a little larger than the opening of the sinus. Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is eased: and do not remove the large cloth, except after some days at one time.
But the one which is over the opening of the sinus, is the one which you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out: and so that you may know whether what flows from it is much, or little; or digested, or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the matter which comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or is approaching adherence: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
But if a subtle discharge comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are some men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are some who act contrary to that.
But if undigested pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, truly let the physicians do, so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their power: such as diafinicon ointment, when an excess of addition of zegi is added to it.
And of the last things by which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal to it in substance.
Then mix it with it, and use it.
And now it does something similar to this action, when you do not have diafinicon ointment present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it. Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire. Then spread over it a cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with the honey which you boiled, until it thickened: and powder over it the spices, and put over it a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes there is administered in it long birthwort, and roots of the celestial lily, and there is lily: and herb flour, and centaury. Use them simple, or combined, grind them, and sift them: and powder over the honey which I have described, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know, that in its depth there is corruption: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been said before.
Concerning the treatment of paronychia and a worn nail, and the incision of an added finger, and section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
Therefore, when its matter is prolonged, and its cure is neglected, and it becomes abscessed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a fetid odor: and the extremity of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you incise with an iron instrument all the excess which remains of the nail. Then cauterize the wound afterwards. For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh inwards, and begin to pierce it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise that flesh easily, and put on what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if corruption already affects the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and remove it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, then incise it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned. Then treat it until it is healed.
But if attrition or a blow happens to the nail, and intense pain results, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first. Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse incision from above downwards.
And take care that the incision does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause very intense pain to the patient thereby, and it will be a cause for the growth of added flesh in the place.
Then treat the place with something that soothes pain.
The added finger which grows on the hands of some men is perhaps wholly fleshy; and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them grow at the root of a joint, or its growth is in some of the joints of the finger. That which grows in some of the joints of the finger does not move; and that which grows near the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Therefore, that one of them which is fleshy, its incision is easy. That is, to incise it at its root with a broad spatula.
But the treatment of that whose growth is at the root of a joint is difficult. Therefore abstain from its incision.
However, in that which grows in a finger near the last joint, then it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a circular incision down to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it. Then treat it until it is healed.
Now, the adhesion which happens to fingers together, very often happens either from a person's birth, that is, they are born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore it is necessary that you cut that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form. Then place between them linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly adhere, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
And similarly if adhesion happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that adhesion, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of vices.
Varices are twisted veins, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body; and their occurrence is mostly in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and carry burdens.
Therefore it is necessary that you administer a shaking of the body from black bile, sometimes with a strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient in the basilic vein.
Their treatment with iron, however, is according to two methods. One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out. And the other method is that the vein is raised, and the whole thing is drawn out.
Its section, however, is according to this method. First bathe the leg with much warm water, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved. Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then raise, that is, draw out the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from the upper part the phlebotomist should first. Then cut the vein downwards until a quantity of blood flows out which you see to be sufficient, and which the patient's strength can bear.
Afterwards bind it: and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
Its elevation is according to this method. Shave the patient's leg if there is much hair on it. Then put him in a bath; or rub his leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins swell; or let him take vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available, until the limb is warm.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and expose the vein on all sides until it becomes visible: and at its appearance, you will see it is red tending toward blackness. When it is taken from the skin, you see it white, like a cord.
Then insert a spatula under it, until it is raised and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Then make another incision close to that incision, three fingers apart. Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears. Then raise it with spatulas as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did before.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need it. Then raise it, and incise it with the last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you pull it out from the incision which is higher, or higher than all the incisions, until when it comes out completely: then incise it.
But if it does not obey you to be pulled out and raised: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand to every part, until it comes out. And beware that it is not incised. For if it is incised, it becomes very difficult for you to raise it, and harm from it enters upon the patient.
Therefore, when you have pulled it out completely: then place on the place of the wounds wool submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it is healed.
But if the thing is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a winding to the parts, and is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you split it in every part of its tortuosity, and the places of its winding.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you raise it completely: and beware in your section upon it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to raise, or extract it. Therefore, preserve your prudence.
The form of the incision by which the thing is healed.
The form of a blind hook.
It does not have a curve like the other hooks, nor is it sharp-ended, so that it does not wound a vein: and it is of thick, gentle curvature; because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness; indeed, let it have superfluous thickness, as we have said.
On the extraction of a vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Algezira, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, of little softness, that is, in which grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms happen within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg. Then the place blisters. Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one and a half drachms to two drachms, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
As often therefore as something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap it in lead, and tie it. But if it is prolonged much, then cut a part of it, and wrap up the remainder. And do not cut it out by the roots before it comes out entirely. Because if you cut it, it is contracted, and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently, and drawn out little by little, until it comes out to the last of it, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed there comes out in some men that which is in its length five palms and ten. And now it has come to me, that it came out of a man of twenty palms.
But if it is cut into you at the time of your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Therefore cure it, as we said in the division, and with what has been said before.
Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in a certain land among us bovine illness, because, for the reason that it very often happens to cattle, and it is a small single worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending; and its movement from limb to limb is shown to the sense, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through in the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. Just as worms and snakes happen, that is, earthworms and ascarids in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malignancy. Because when it goes in the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place: then perhaps it opens there and emerges and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except during its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature. Then cut above it and extract it.
But if it penetrates deeply into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies.
And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see it has already arrived at the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good binding. Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient use cleansing of his body with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which happens in certain limbs: then it is transferred from limb to limb.
And I myself have already seen it, according to what I relate to you. I was called to a woman afflicted in certain villages. And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained for one hour, I saw one swelling moving with a swiftness, just as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it was like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain departed from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Then she related to me that it was turning itself around in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore I was amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb. And indeed I had not before seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner. Nevertheless I saw many who found pain shifting from limb to limb: and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think that it is, except that it is because the woman was of those who are from villages of dry bodies and uncovered veins: hence therefore that windy change appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this manner in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
Therefore when you wish its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you by eye, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it until that constricted wind escapes: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and removes them with fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and the like.
Concerning the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall in the body.
Their diversity is this: for among them are those which have large and small points: and concave and blunt ones. And among them are those which have three angles. And among them are those which have barbs. And among them are those which have barbs.
Those, however, which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two methods. For either the members are of the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things. Therefore when it falls in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall relate to you later, appear to you, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most instances. And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the membrane which is above the brain, are: because there happen from it violent thirst, and dimness of vision, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile. And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed. And a white moisture similar to pap exits from the place of the wound. And something like the watery part of flesh comes out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
However, the signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something empty. And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound. And coldness of the extremities follows, and cold sweat, and fainting. Know therefore that death approaches without doubt.
And a sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the sick person changes. And he breathes a large, deep breath: and he seeks the intake of cold air.
But if the arrow falls into the covering which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and great shortness of breath occurs with intense pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food comes out of the wound.
And if an arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the faeces comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which has already been broken. Therefore there is no hope in his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
But if an arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger upon the patient: then know that it is mortal.
The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to many dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not venomous.
And I tell you what I have seen of the being of these arrows, that you may signify by that concerning your cure.
Which is, that to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose. Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small extremity, with which it adhered to its wood: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with a smooth iron head, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs. Therefore I made an incision upon it between two guide-strings: and it was already submerged in his throat. Therefore I worked delicately with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed him, and nothing of his condition had changed, I incised over the arrow; and I worked skillfully on it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill accident befell him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it. After therefore seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and none of her condition changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound closed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many similar cases to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had now deviated a little to the right side: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to his treatment after the arrow injury for three days. Therefore I found the arrow wound very tight.
Therefore I searched for it with a slender probe, and I did not feel it: and he himself indeed found a puncture and pain under his right ear. Therefore I hoped that that puncture was from the point of the arrow.
Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster which had attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself that the place would suppurate, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut upon it: and there did not happen in the place an event signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Therefore I persevered with the plaster upon him for many days: and no event happened, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained ill from the extraction of it for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose. And he related that to me.
And he related that to me. Therefore I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed it, I felt the slender point of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound by means of that sharp medicine, until the point of the arrow appeared to us visibly: and there passed for me with him a space of time of about four months.
Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and to move it, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to refine, and devise concerning it with ingenious methods, until I began on a certain day with decently made forceps, according to what their form will be at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it. Then I restored the wound.
And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the sick man was healed with complete health: nor did anything at all harm him.
And I relate to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and explanation concerning that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration: nor does the book comprehend that, and the skillful artisan compares a little with much: and with that which is present, concerning that which is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of strange things of this art when they happen.
I say therefore, that arrows do not come out from the limbs in which they are fixed, except according to two methods. Or by traction from the place from which it entered. Or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which goes out from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is pulled, and it goes out.
But if it does not obey exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its traction is lessened, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and it does not obey you for exit, then leave it also for some days: and repeat it with traction and movement every day, until it goes out.
But if it does not obey you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you bore around the arrow in the bone itself from every part with a thin drill, until the arrow is enlarged. Then pull it, and extract it.
But if the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is hidden and concealed from sensation: then search for it with a probe. But if you feel it, then pull it out with some instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot get to it, because of the tightness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then cut it open, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on every side, by every means you can, and by means, if it cannot be done without the evasion of the flesh in the breaking of the barbs and their twisting, until it comes out.
And when you are managing the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps in all directions, until you make it come out: and subtle things with subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
But if you cannot get it out within an hour, then leave it for a few days, until those things around it rot. Then try again: for the sheath will be loosened. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said of treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And administer every possible means of getting the arrow out: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you pull out the arrow, you make the patient lie in the same position as when the arrow struck him. Because it is more helpful. But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from among the positions.
But an arrow which emerges from the opposite side, or something of it already protrudes externally: or the point of the arrow makes a swelling on the skin above, which you see raised: therefore cut over it, and let the incision be such that forceps can grasp it.
Then pull it out; for it will then easily come out.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness until the arrow is embedded in the bone and enlarges itself: then pull it out.
And if not: leave it for a few days: then repeat this until it comes out.
And if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it out with it.
But if the wood has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push: then insert a concave instrument so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow: then push it out with this.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering into it. For the arrow is lightened by that.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which is the poison, if it is possible for you. Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow is embedded in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near to that which you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like hooks: when they seize the arrow, they do not let it go.
And many kinds are made of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
The shape of the concave pusher.
And the shape of the blunt pusher.
This is a blunt end like a spoke, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be pushed with it.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
The veins to be phlebotomised, whose use is customary in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbae; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two lacrimal ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the tip of the nose. And two Guidegi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins which are called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the outer side: and the common people call it the vein of the head. And the dark one. And there is the median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body. And the Basilic, and it is situated on the inner side: and it is also called Titillicaris. And the common people call it the vein of the belly. And the cord of the arm, and it is situated above the bend: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear application.
And the Salvatella: and it is a vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the outer side. And the second is the Saphena: and its place is near the heel from the inner side. And the vein Nesse: and its place is near the heel from the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy, however, of the two veins which are behind the ears, is a help for old catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and bad old head ulcers.
And the manner of phlebotomizing it is according to what I relate. And it is so that the head of the sick person is shaved: and his occiput in the place of the two veins is rubbed with a rough cloth with a good rubbing. Then let the sick person bind his neck with a headband, until the two veins appear. And their places are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head. Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with ink.
Then take a lancet phlebotom, and it is that which is called Incidens. Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the phlebotom reaches the mouth. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and incise the vein with the skin with an incisive incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and let as much blood come out as you wish.
Then bind it with pledgets, and leave it until it heals.
And already the incision and cauterization of them preceded in the beginning of the book.
Truly, the two arteries which are in the two times of phlebotomy are a help for old hemicrania: and bad toothache, and persistent ophthalmia: and the flow of sharp effused superfluities to the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I relate to you. Let the infirm person tighten his neck very much, until two veins appear manifestly to the sense of sight: and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger. Then mark them with cautery.
Then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the cutting phlebotome underneath, and raise the vein upwards. And incise it, as you did in the other two veins: and let blood flow according to the quantity of your necessity.
Then loosen the constriction of the infirm person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour. Afterwards place a pledget and lint over it, and bind it tightly above: and leave it until it heals.
And now the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction has preceded in the beginning of the book.
The help, however, of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is, after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for old facial sicknesses: and for hemicrania, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I relate to you. The infirm person binds his neck with a headband until the vein appears. Then take the instrument which is called a Fossorium.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium upon the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with another thing in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity which you wish. Then unbind the patient's perforation, and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotome. However, it is not necessary that the phlebotome be of a sharp end, like the other phlebotomes, but rather of a broad end. And phlebotomize it according to the transverse; because the bone is near; and perhaps in it the phlebotome will be broken when it is thin.
Moreover, the benefit of the two veins which are in the two lacrimals of the two eyes, is for the eye from scab and redness: and seil in the eye, and sicknesses of the face.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is, that the infirm person should bind his neck with a fillet. Then phlebotomize them; and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across, to a little length, with a small, somewhat broad phlebotome, for there is no flesh in the place. For if the phlebotome is of a thin point, perhaps it will break.
Then make the blood run as much as is necessary for you. And put a pledget on them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Moreover, the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and vehement headache, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness which happens in the face: especially when it is of long standing.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should bind his neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long phlebotomy instrument: and insert it in the middle of his nostril, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness. Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the phlebotomy instrument a little while: and you cause to run out blood according to your need. Then bind it one night. For it is restored quickly.
Truly, the phlebotomy of two Guidegi is a help for shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosive ones, that is, herpes esthiomenus.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the sick person binds himself under both in his neck with a ligature; and the surgeon stands over the head of the sick person, and the sick person sits upon a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to the length of a fairly large phlebotomy. Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it. Then do similarly with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction, so that the sick person is not choked. And leave it until morning. For the wound heals.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins, Albucasis. Moreover, the vein according to Albucasis is an aid to phlebotomy because it contributes to canker in the mouth and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers also which are in the nose and in its circumference.
And the manner of phlebotomy of them is that you make the infirm one sit before you and bind his neck with a fillet. Then roll back his lip and look at two veins: of which one is on the right of the lip, and the second on the left of it; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both. And this is true: because in their circumference are small, black veins. Therefore incise each with an incised incision.
But if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then attend to the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed custom mostly runs with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein. Indeed, the help of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for obstructions which are in the throat, and illness of the uvula, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun: and lift his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein: and the color of each inclines towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize both: and be careful, lest you injure your hand in phlebotomizing them. For under them are arteries, and perhaps there will happen a flow of blood from those arteries.
Now the three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are those in whose phlebotomy custom runs in all men.
And the phlebotomy of them is done according to two methods. Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or an olive-shaped one to a sloping thinness: or by cutting with a knife-like phlebotome, and it is Alnesil. And this is its form.
And of them are broad species, and subtle according to the size of the veins and their stricture. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see. And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of less breadth, and more subtly pointed.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of subtle veins, which contain subtle, yellow blood.
Now the basilica, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and belly: and it befits the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomizes it, that he be cautious, and be in fear because of it, for under it is an artery. Therefore if he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will happen. Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a pointed phlebotomy knife; rather let it be cut with an alnesil.
But if the basilica does not appear in manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you leave it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in its place the vein of the arm. For it is manifest, and cut it with the alnesil phlebotomy knife, as we said.
But if you wish the phlebotomy of the same, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse. Then mark the place with a cautery, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the alnesil phlebotomy knife, as we said. And beware lest the incision fall through the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
But if you see the blood in the phlebotomy leaping up, like the urine of a boy, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery. Then therefore hasten, and place your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger. If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of movement of it: and let him be upon his guard.
And let him not move it for some days, until it is healed.
But if the blood is not cut off, and overcomes you: and you do not have medicine present at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you. For its extremities are constricted, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a pistachio, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein's constriction fittingly, with a bandage and powders until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good. And if not: then treat it with that whose mention preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most situations, because of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Moreover, the benefit of phlebotomy of the median vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body: therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic, and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be careful about its phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve. If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, numbness happens in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
And this nerve very often appears to the sense. But if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, by which you phlebotomize, an incision with an Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein. Moreover, phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to illnesses of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-shaped phlebotome, or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotome: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve.
Nevertheless it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the phlebotome only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first puncture, that it be repeated upon it with phlebotomy several times.
Nevertheless perhaps it becomes inflamed in some men when it is not phlebotomized in the first puncture, but that inflammation does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it. The quality of phlebotomy, and its consequences, in whose rectification it is necessary for you to think.
First therefore of that it is necessary that you know, that phlebotomy is not administered, except in the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution from the coming of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Median, and the Basilic. And that phlebotomy be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomy however which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when expediency and necessity prompt to it, in the night, or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not fitting that boys be bled until fourteen years have come upon them. Nor let a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month to the seventh. Nor let old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore when anyone wishes to be bled for whatever reason it may be: it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if much retained excrement is in them: so that the veins do not draw during phlebotomy from the intestines putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Nor let a patient suffering from nausea, that is, sickness, be bled: nor one who is crapulent, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them. Nor one ill with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after a colic attack, and vomiting, and dysentery, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and wakefulness, and fasting, and everything that weakens the bodily or animal strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him exercise in some way, so that the blood may be refined.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and strive that his chest be evacuated on that day from all bad animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and those similar.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs, from aromatics and fragrance, and dancing and things like that, in as much quantity as possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the phlebotomized; afterwards let him pull out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice. Then let him tighten the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or excessive in constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is weak, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction it is necessary that the phlebotomized person rub his hands together until the veins swell and are evident to the senses.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the phlebotomized person with a little old oil, properly.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, a little below the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, so that the vein does not escape and the incision is not missed. Because some veins are found like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy; and some are full of wind; and when you place the phlebotomist over it, it contracts under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm, and be careful in all these things.
Then let him remove the phlebotomist. If therefore the vein is opened at once, then it is good. And if not, then repeat it another time a little below that place, or above it quickly, if the place is not suppurating.
But if it suppurates, or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two: and do not tie the ligature. For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess. Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows slowly, and you fear that the quantity of blood you wish will not flow out, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening, in a straight line, and add a little to the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many men a small operation.
Therefore if you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it at all, for it excuses nothing in you. And put on it some oil dregs, because it eases the flow of blood. And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer oil dregs in all your phlebotomy, which phlebotomizes veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and theriac alfarach and sagzenea do this, when one of them is placed on the place.
For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
But if a large abscess occurs at the place of phlebotomy, for this often happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for an hour: because it is dissolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
But if something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after some days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put on it something of aloe or myrrh dissolved: or something of mint juice, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
And very often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at the phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Therefore put your hand upon it, then if you find softness at your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad. Beware therefore, that you put upon it something of that which we have said. For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is stypticity, so that the place may be hardened. Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his strength. And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it is red: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it out until it is thinned: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein phlebotomy be amplified, and the phlebotomist be wide: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in times, and that the opening be narrow: and better that which is administered in vein phlebotomy is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve: and it is more laudable, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And to whom syncope is accustomed to come upon in phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread infused in pomegranate juice water: or succabi, if it is warmed: and you shall extract from him of the blood in three times, or four.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in grape syrup, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in fragrant aromatized syrup.
But if syncope happens during phlebotomy, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that he take in drink meat water, and subtle fragrant syrup: and let him use aromatics with aloes, and let his chest be anointed with it: and let him use the other things which we said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually according to the amount of strength in continuous days.
But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine, from his first phlebotomy.
But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be bled on the second day, or on the third.
But in whose body there is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to happen: it is necessary that blood go out from him at one time, and a large quantity be drawn out from him: and the opening be widened until syncope happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you place your hand upon his pulse at the course of blood, lest death happen in place of syncope. For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
And it is not necessary when you wish to open the arm, and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon with vehemence, and bent and extended quickly. For that is very bad, indeed; rather leave it, until he is bled a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of a phlebotomy instrument that which is coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it something of salt dissolved in water. And place upon it something of theriac alfaroch, or sagapenum, and apply it with gentle compression, until the blood flows out.
But if the vein is already abscessed, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the abscess subsides.
But if necessity requires bleeding a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize him above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
The rope of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the Median and Basilic veins, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the infirm person should put his hand in warm water until the skin reddens, and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be bound above it with a ligature of moderate tightness. Then phlebotomize transversely little by little, not laterally, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize above the joint of the hand a little.
If the flow of blood is prevented, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you obtain your requirement.
But if it is in the days of summer, then you are excused from putting the hand repeatedly in warm water. And indeed, the running of blood into warm water is mostly done in the time of winter.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy, however, of the Salvatella vein of the right hand, benefits liver diseases.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that you constrict the Salvatella of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you have put it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly demonstrated to the sense. Then phlebotomize it transversely. And if you incise it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And take care not to wound your hand with the phlebotome. For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers bared of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it. For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be prevented from flowing.
Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not quickly clot.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
The help, however, of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it contributes to the illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
The help of phlebotomy in the saphenous vein, however, is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menstrual blood, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person puts his foot into warm water: and makes friction upon it, until the veins swell: and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap. And indeed the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the thumb: and many branches ramify from it in the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its collection: because it is better and safer.
But if you phlebotomize it in the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
But if the exit of blood is prevented, then bathe his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
But if he misses the vein in the first attempt, then repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you avoid the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is near the heel on the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry; and bind his leg from the side of the hip up to above the heel by four fingers, with a long thin band; for it does not appear except because of that.
When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to its direction: and it is better, either to incise it with an incision, or to cut it with a section. For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most men.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most men. But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the dorsum of the foot, and towards the auriculare; and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you wish flow out.
Then loosen the constriction, and place leather over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place. For it heals quickly.
Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from brass, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways. With scarification and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods. Or it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body for cupping which is administered with scarification and bloodletting. Of which one is, the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are the two sides of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the spine: and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two thighs: and the cuppings of the two ankles.
And cupping indeed does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, strength does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy. Nor is it necessary that cupping be administered either with fire or without fire in any illnesses which occur from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity prompts cupping because of illness or custom, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Which is because there are men in whom blood is multiplied until it needs extraction by cupping, and they find heaviness and headache in their head.
And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the place of their cupping. And some of them have increased laughter. And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth; or their tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood. And some of them have increased sleep. And some of them see blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them in their sleep.
Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and what is poured out into the eyes. However, it is necessary that this be after evacuation of the whole body.
And indeed this cupping is in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
And it is not permitted that one use it who is of cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh. For it brings great harm to him.
And because of that it is not necessary that the elderly use it, and those in whose head are cold illnesses.
But he who is assiduous over it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
And because of that it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that he should remove his hand with the cupping glass a little to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Cupping or Alkehel is in place of the incision of the mediana cephalica vein, and the incision of the basilica vein, and because of that it benefits asthma, and constriction of breath, and fissure of the instrument of breath, and cough, and repletion.
And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping glass be applied gently, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping of alhagdahim, however, benefits pains occurring in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of the incision of the basilica vein.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not cut an artery, and a flow of blood occurs.
Cupping under the chin, however, benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses which are in the mouth: and it stands in place of the incision of the alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulder blades, however, benefits alchafacham, which is caused by repletion and heat.
Cupping, however, of the inner parts of the two thighs benefits in place of the phlebotomy of the three veins, the basilica, the median, and the cephalic: because it itself draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh: and those small veins draw from other thicker veins, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to proceed far in scarification: because the place is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Cupping, however, which is applied over the alchausos, benefits hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that the cupping glass be large, and that it be made of air: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps thin cupping glasses break: and let it be scarified with a large scarification.
Cupping of the legs, however, diminishes noticeably: because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old pains in the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder: they provoke menstruation, and benefit boils, and ademenul: and they stand in place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the alhorcobeni.
However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to occur in many men.
And the benefit of cupping of the alhorcobeni is close to the benefit of cupping of the two legs.
The quality of the placement of cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass first empty, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival: and do not cease to iterate this and continue, until you see the place now reddened and swollen, and the redness of blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For whoever of men is of tender flesh, of sparse pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, not more: lest the place be ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification, and deepen it a little: and moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and gentle movement.
But if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice. In the first instance indeed a way is opened for the thinning of the blood, and its watery part: and in the second indeed for the thorough investigation of the extraction of thick blood.
But if the blood is very foul, then let a scarification be made a third time: that the ultimate result may be achieved.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little, one scarification is sufficient for us. But if we wish the extraction of much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification: and the equal limit in scarification, is the depth of the skin.
What is that which it is necessary to administer of oils at the placing of cupping-glasses, and what the one who applies cupping-glasses should beware of.
Indeed in him whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are constricted, it is necessary that the places to be cupped be anointed with opening, softening, resolving oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is oil of alkeiri, or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of gourd seed.
And if it is in the time of winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or sarbatine oil: and similar things.
If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then let the oil be marjoram oil, or balsam oil, or pennyroyal oil, or dill oil: and similar things.
If however he who is to be cupped has large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he be forbidden oil, and it is necessary that they wash the places of the cupping-glasses after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with water of solanum, or with gourd water, or with purslane water: and similar things.
But he whose blood is of much humidity, let him wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and similar things.
But he whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his cuppings with old wine, or with water of  henbane, or a decoction of dill, or chamomile: and similar things.
And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in the bath, or immediately after the bath; indeed it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
What is it by which the one to be cupped, or bled, ought to be regulated before cupping?
And after it, it is necessary that you consider first: then if the cupped or bled one is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood: then it is necessary that he receive cooling things, such as pomegranate, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and succory, and julep: and similar things.
And put among his foods chickens, and the flesh of young sheep, and foods seasoned with verjuice: and similar things.
And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be instructed to use a small quantity of food. And put among his food chickens, and canebir; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and he should eat young pigeons.
And it is necessary that drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than food: and it is necessary that there be given to drink to certain men in the hours theriac alfaroch, or a medicine of musk, that is, nutmeg, or electuary before cupping: and before bloodletting, or after: that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood thinned. And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
Concerning cupping without scarification. Cuppings, however, which are without scarification, are cuppings which are placed upon the liver, and spleen, and gout, and upon the belly, navel, and the regions of the kidneys, and the hip joint: because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
And it is not sought by them, except either the drawing of blood from a member to a member:  just as we place a cupping glass upon the breasts in the sickness of nasal bleeding. And we use them to resolve cold, trapped flatulence in a member: just as we place a cupping glass upon the belly and navel. For it itself rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes pain therefore, because it resolves that flatulence.
It is also placed upon the kidneys, when there occurs in them obstruction, or a stone. For by the virtue of its attraction perhaps it opens the obstruction, or removes the stone from its place.
And similarly it acts when placed upon the liver and spleen for rubbing flatulence in both of them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only incision. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in cases of pleurisy: and that is so that the cupping glass may be filled, and it being large, with warm water alone, or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass administered with fire.
Let the width of its opening be that of two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be in its side, in the place which is about its middle, a small hole, according to the size that a needle may enter it: let it be made of bronze or brass, of thick edges, smooth, even, polished: so that it may not injure the limb when placed upon it: and let there be across its middle a transverse rod of bronze or iron, where a candle with a fire is placed.
And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than that which we have described, and a little smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
For cupping glasses for children and thin people are different from cupping glasses for men and those of corpulent bodies.
The method of applying this cupping glass with fire to a limb is to light a small linen wick decently with fire, or a small wax candle: and place it on the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the lit fire is around the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the patient is not burned.
Then let it be placed on the limb: and a finger should be placed over the hole which I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass; while we need it, we remove the finger, and the vapor will go out through that hole, and the cupping glass will be immediately removed.
Then relight the linen wick in its own way, and repeat it, if you need it.
In the cupping glass however which is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not administered, except that it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
And this is its form.
And this cupping glass, the larger it is, so that it can hold much water, is better.
Concerning the application of leeches.
Leeches are not applied in many places except in those members where the application of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their smallness, such as the lip and the gums, and similar things. Or in a member denuded of flesh, such as a finger and nose, and similar things.
And the manner of using them is: that you take leeches which are in fresh waters, clean from putrefaction.
Then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is evacuated first with phlebotomy and with cupping glasses. Then wipe the member of the sick person until it is red. Afterwards, let them be placed upon it.
Therefore, when they are full and fall off, and suction of the place with a cupping glass is possible, then it is most effective in helping; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then with much water, and let it be rubbed, and squeezed out.
But if the flow of blood is prolonged after the falling off of the leeches, and it is oozing: then dip a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the oozing stops.
But if the blood increases, then powder over it crushed alum, or galls, and similar things from among the styptics: until the blood stops.
Or let there be placed on the place halves of shelled beans: and let them remain, until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood will stop.
And it is necessary, if a repetition of leeches is necessary, when it is possible, to change them.
But if leeches are prevented from attaching, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood. Or prick the places with a needle, until something of the blood comes out. Then let them be placed, for when they sense something of the blood, they adhere immediately.
Therefore when you wish them to fall off, sprinkle on them something of powdered aloes, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall off immediately.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, O sons, that foolish doctors and laymen boast of this chapter, who have never inspected the book of the ancients, nor read a letter from it.
And for this reason it happens that this method is deprived from the sciences in our land. And I never encountered anything good in it, and I did not acquire from it what I acquired except because of the length of reading the books of the ancients, and the study of understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
And now I have described to you from it in this chapter all that my knowledge contains: and what my experiment has passed over, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the burden of length, and abbreviated it with the abbreviation of brevity, and shown it with the clarity of directness: and I have formed in it many forms of the forms of instruments which are used in it, since it is from the addition of directness, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse and chapters, whose understanding the craftsman is compelled to first achieve in order to stand upon their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or may learn this noble art, and others through you.
I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or sprain, or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary that you hasten first to bleed him, and to loosen him, or both together: if nothing prohibits it, such as weakness of strength; or if the one to whom one of these things has happened is a child, or a decrepit old man; or if it is a time of intense heat, or of intense cold.
Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and the meat of birds and kids; and forbid wine, and coarse meats, and being filled with foods and every food that fills the veins with blood. Until when you are secure from a hot abscess, and you do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the infirm return to his first regime with which his custom ran.
Therefore, when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the infirm be fed with nourishing foods, with much, coarse, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish; and thick wine, and things similar to them. For with this regime the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and the decrepit, it is not possible that they are joined together and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their limbs; and those which are in the end of softness are consolidated and joined together, like the bones of small children.
Nevertheless, nature attaches to the broken bone on every side something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you give the infirm nourishment of foods in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: because a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another: and I have come with a recollection of every kind of fracture explained in its own Chapter, distinct from another. And the kinds of bone fracture are also diversified in themselves.
Because its fracture is curved, besides which splinters occur in it. And sometimes its fracture is according to the length of the bone: and its fractures are splinters, that is, splinters and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed when it is sharpened with a knife for writing. And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture a small fissure.
And each kind has its own method or instrument in its restoration, according to what will come to its recollection, distinct in its places.
And from what a bone fracture is known is its crookedness, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
When therefore there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor sound on your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the patient find great pain: then there is no fracture there, indeed it is possible that there is crookedness, or a small fissure: therefore it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compression completely, indeed put on it of the medicines, of which the recollection comes, after that moment which is suitable for the place: then let a thin bandage be applied.
And know that when a place is arched and split in two, besides what happens in it, truly every part is removed from its fellow: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to its rectification, equalizing it before a hot abscess happens to it.
But if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess rests. Then equalize it according to whichever way can be done with gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration and its equalization is easier than of a bone in which splinters occur.
Then bind it, according to what recollection of it will come to you.
But if there are splinters in the bone, then extension of this broken member from two parts is necessary, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the member on a level place, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions return to their places with all skill, and in whatever way you can: and beware according to your strength, lest pain or injury occur to the weak one through your operation: and try according to your strength to apply one of two bones with its fellow, according to the best methods.
And it is necessary at that time that you try and touch it with your hand. If therefore you see anything different there, correct it and equalize it according to the measure of your strength.
And beware of vehement extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do. For very often they cause by that operation of theirs a hot abscess, or a contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations very often.
Then, after equalization and proper operation and constriction of that member, and rest and tranquility, give advice to the patient about it. And make him beware lest he move it at the hour of his waking and his sleep, in his turning and tossing, and in his evacuation, and all his movements with his utmost strength. And that he should beware lest the position of the member be a position which is followed by pain. That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the disposition of the position of the member, then it is necessary that you change it to another disposition from that with which he does not feel pain.
And be careful with him that its position be that equal, straight one; so that crookedness does not happen in the member when it is restored.
And the quality of the binding of the broken member is as I relate.
Know that broken members are diversified in their smallness and their size and their shape.
Therefore, those of them which are small, such as the arm and finger and shin and similar things, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth. But those of them which are thick, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be in them a wide, firm wrapping.
Because a wide ligature connects a large member and binds it on every side with an equal binding, so that a blemish does not enter it.
Then begin after your evacuation, from the equation, to place a suitable liniment on it, in soft lint over the place of its fracture. Then begin to wrap the ligature over the place of its fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the member deserves: and tighten your hand a little with the ligature.
Then proceed with it to the upper part from the place of fracture, and tighten less than was your binding with which you bound the broken place. Then extend yourself with the wrapping from the place of fracture a little, and soften the binding gradually, until you take from the healthy place a large amount.
Then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the broken place with wrappings. Afterwards proceed with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture. And let your work be in the binding of the wrapping, and the softening of it, according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Then place between the wrappings some soft tow, or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture is evened out, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Then wrap another bandage over it. Afterwards evenly place over these bandages properly made compresses immediately, if there is no swelling in the place, nor hot abscess.
But if there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place over it that which settles that abscess and removes the swelling; and leave it for some days. Then tighten the compresses over it.
And let the compresses be from the middle of a reed, wide, shaved, skillfully shaped; or let them be from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or gerard, that is, from palm branches, or calingi; and let the size of each compress be according to this form, and this same figure.
However, it is necessary that the compress which is placed over the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other compresses; and the length of the compress should be according to what the limb allows in size and smallness.
Then bind over the compresses with another bandage, according to the same first binding. Then bind over it neatly with threads, as we said of the binding: and it is so that your binding over the place of the fracture is greater; and the more it is extended from the fracture, the lesser the binding.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of foolish men placing their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great error; because the binding falls with them outside the proper quality.
And thin threads again are not suitable; because you will not achieve with them through the binding that which you wish.
And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between splint and splint.
But if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after binding in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow, or carded wool, until nothing is injured thereby.
But when there is a fracture with a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, I will treat it with a discussion of it in the second chapter according to its particular nature.
And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with splints from the first day. That is because, when a limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints upon it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your certainty from the outcome of a hot abscess.
And this is the method of plasters which the ancients used, which are placed over a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children: because it is made of things which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
And it is to take from the dust of the mill, and it is the marrow of flour which hangs on the walls of the mill at the motion of the millstone: and prepare it as it is, except that you sift it with egg white: and make its consistency neither thick nor thin. Then use it.
¶ Method of another plaster, restoring fracture, and dislocation, and torsion. Take almess, and laudanum, and acacia, and inula, and mugath: and the juice of all, of each 10 drachms, of myrrh and aloe, of each 5 drachms, and of alethil 20 drachms. Let all be ground, and sifted, and mixed with the water of alethil: or with egg white, if the complexion of the patient is heated. Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Method of another plaster, which also benefits fracture and torsion. Take mugath, and mess, and white mallow, of each 10 drachms, of myrrh and aloe, of each 5 drachms, of acacia 6 drachms, of Armenian bole 20 drachms. Let all be ground very finely, and sifted, and made with water, or egg white: and applied.
¶ Method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain affecting them, and a fissure of the bone, and fracture. Let greasy wool be taken, and submerged in vinegar and boiled oil: and let it be placed on the place.
And indeed in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in soothing a hot abscess: and it expels pains properly.
¶ Method of a plaster which restores a broken bone. Take leaves of the wild fig, and leaves of wild poppy: and grind everything, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Method of an abbreviated plaster, administered in the restoration of a bone fracture: and when you wish resolution of the remainder of an abscess. Take of marshmallow root, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and made up with wine, if the member is not heated.
But if it is heated, then make it up with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Method of another plaster stronger in resolution than the first one, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a member. Take of marshmallow root, and linseed, and balaustines, and melilot, and bugloss, and violet flower, and chamomile, of each one part; let all be ground, and made up with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine. All this according to the warmth of the member, and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates however did not say in his book that anything should be put on a broken member during its restoration except cerate made from wax and oil: nothing else: and he related that it should be medium between thickness and thinness.
To Galen however it seemed that things should be put on a broken member during its restoration in which there is a drying of heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and things similar to them from those which we have related.
Method of a plaster which contributes to injury and pain. Take mugath, and chickpeas, and cut human hair, or bird feather, and mallow, and salt in equal parts: let them be ground, and sifted, and prepared: and let a plaster be made from it.
The quantity however according to which it is necessary that the bandage remain, then be loosened, is that you consider then, if no pain happens to the patient, nor itching, nor is the broken bone moved from its place: then do not loosen it for many days. But if intense itching or disturbing pain, or swelling happens to him in the place: then hasten, and loosen it at once, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in warm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching rests, and the pain settles.
But if intense itching or disturbing pain, or swelling happens to him in the place: then hasten, and loosen it at once, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in warm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching rests, and the pain settles. Then let the limb rest for one hour. Then place on it cut wool, submerged in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it on for one night, until you are secure from a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb rests, and its pain is removed.
Then return it to a fine ligature, and a small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constriction, and refine with it, until it is healed.
But if you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the accidents are now completely removed, and you do not need a plaster and ligature, then repeat it as you did in the beginning equally.
But if nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, then do not loosen it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven. And when twenty days have passed, the whole of it, according to what appears to you from the loosening of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of flesh approaches over it: then also add to the ligature more than your whole first ligature: and also add to the thickening of the patient's food, according to what preceded its recollection.
But if you see the place of the fracture now drying up, and thinning more than it ought: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it. Therefore bathe it with warm water at every time when you loosen it, and let this be done every three days, and lessen the ligature a little.
Through this operation therefore nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
But what foolish restorers do in the case of a fractured limb, when it is not restored in the first instance as it should be, and is restored according to crookedness, is an error of their operation, and a great danger: and if it were right, the ancients would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
And I have seen nowhere any trace of them at all in it, and it is better that it not be done.
Concerning the treatment of an accident in the head.
The kinds of fracture are diverse, and its forms many: and its causes are distinct.
For there is a fracture which is made by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone entirely as far as it reaches the periosteum, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and on account of this this kind of fracture is called Axial.
Or a sword cuts some of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its end: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Elevation absolutely.
And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
And there is a fracture which is a contusion, or attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the periosteum, which is under the bone: or it is in the surface of the bone: and a wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this kind of fracture is called Capillary.
And of these is a fracture which is made by a fall, or blow from a stone, and similar things, which cause a lamina of bone to enter inwards, and a concavity is made in the place: just as happens to bronze cauldrons, when a blow meets them, and a part of them enters inwards.
And this happens very much indeed in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
And for all these kinds of fractures separate treatments are made, and I will come to the recollection of all of that in its place.
And we recognize all these kinds of fracture by examination upon it, and investigation of them with probes, and removal of the corrupt flesh which is upon them.
The hair-line fracture however is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and is wiped, and is anointed upon it with encaustic: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment however of fracture, consider first the accidents of the patient: then if you see from the accidents that it signifies by manifest signification a danger, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar to them from accidents in many conditions, undoubtedly it is not healed: and if you see accidents not frightening you, and you hope for salvation: then begin its treatment.
That is, if a wounded man comes to you first when he is wounded: and that is in the days of winter, then it is necessary that you strive in the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane is corrupted, and those accidents which we have related happen.
But if the fracture of the bone has now reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with small pieces, and attraction: then it is necessary that you cut the broken and worn part, according to what I tell you.
And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded man: and uncover the bone in whichever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and that which is light upon the patient.
But if a flow of blood or a hot abscess happens to you upon the uncovering of the bone: then oppose it with that which is necessary. And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the abscess settles, and you are secure from the flow of blood. Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
And that is done according to one of two methods.
One method indeed is, that you incise the bone with a narrow-bladed incisor: and this is its form.
Then administer another incisor after the incisor, a little wider than it: and this is its form.
Then administer yet another incisor, wider even than the second.
And the second method is, that you have at hand a number of different incisors: of which some are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others: and let them be sharp at the tips of their extremities, and let them be of tempered iron, or steel: and use care in striking upon the incisor, so that it does not shake the head, and injure it.
But if the bone is perchance hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you administer the incisors, with drills which are called non-penetrating drills: and they are not so named except because they do not pass through the limit of the fleshy bone to that which is beyond it: because the drill has a round extremity above that which is under its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting for you to take of these drills a large number, each of which suits the quantity of the thickness of the bone, until there is present for every skull a drill: the quantity of whose sharp extremity in length and shortness is according to the quantity of the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepans.
Moreover, the quality of perforating in the circumference of the fractured bone is: that you place the drill upon the bone, and revolve it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has already been penetrated. Then change the drill to another place, and place what is between each hole at the amount of the thickness of a finger, or thereabouts.
Then incise with the incisors what is between each hole of bone: and make it as thin as you can on that from the end of lightness, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with something else from certain instruments which you have prepared for it: such as forceps, and fine scissors.
And it is necessary that you take every precaution lest the drill or incisor touch anything of the dura mater.
Therefore, when you have gone around the bone by perforating, and it has been separated from the dura mater, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you shave and smooth the end of that which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the incisor. However, it is necessary that it be thinner and finer than other incisors.
But if something remains of the small bones and splinters, then take them away easily with what you have of instruments. Then treat the wound afterwards with linen cloths and the ointments which we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easy, completely far from fear: which Galen mentioned, and praised it with great praise: and this is his statement. It is necessary for you first to begin uncovering the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and more evident, until when you have uncovered that part, and you have placed under it the end of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form.
And the lenticular part, smooth, does not cut anything; and its sharp part, going in its two sides lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part is supported against the fat, its sharp side falling upon the bone.
Then strike upon the incisor from one side with a small hammer, until you cut through all the bone easily, as if it were rolling; and you should be secure from the membrane, so that nothing happens to it which you fear at all.
And if the physician were not the most foolish of men, and more ignorant of this, nor were he sleeping, then if something of the membrane remained attached to the bone in some places, he would cut it from it with the end of that lenticular incisor, and free it from it easily. For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it: then it is necessary that you shave that roughness, and remove those splinters with fine rasps of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it is possible for you to use the most suitable and straightest of them in every place, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the bone itself which is broken, and its shape. And it is necessary that you use in your scraping, with which you first scrape the bone, the wider of those rasps. Then use a finer one after it.
And it is necessary that you use in your scraping, with which you first scrape the bone, the wider of those rasps. Then use a finer one after it. And do not cease doing that continuously, until you arrive at using the finest and most delicate of them all.
In each of the remaining small, hair-like fissures and delicate fractures, it is necessary that you administer care according to that which leads to its straightening.
And it is a matter which is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and has considered what we have written and shown in large fractures.
But if the exposed membrane remains when you remove the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and submerge it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as easily as you can so that the fat is not burdened.
Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not bind it tightly except to the extent that it holds the wound only: and leave it with this dressing for one day, or two days, until you are secure from a hot abscess. Then loosen it, and afterwards apply medicines with which there is superfluous dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and similar things; and you should make a powder from these medicines, which is sprinkled over the wound when dry.
And universally apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite. And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clean; nor should there be any dirt from ointment, nor any filth.
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clean; nor should there be any dirt from ointment, nor any filth. Nor allow pus to collect in it at all: because when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and great harm befalls the patient afterwards: and there occurs in the dura mater, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Consider then, if the accidents which we have mentioned befall the patient, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and apply a cloth with them. Then place it on the dura mater; afterwards treat it with the kinds of treatment which are suitable, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that only two of its upper parts, or one of them, are broken from the nose; because these are two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and nothing happens to it except abrasion, and crookedness, and flatness.
If one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary that you insert the little finger into the hole of the nose, and equalize that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural form; and let this be done skillfully and easily. And beware that no pain occurs to the patient through your operation.
But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it is necessary that it be set with the end of a radius, in which there is a small thickness.
But if the fracture is in two parts, then do likewise; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the subsidence of the warm abscess.
Then insert into the end of the nose a pledget of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pledgets if the fracture is in two parts; and let the thickness of the pledget be of such a quantity as to fill the opening of the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers said that the pledgets should be infused in butter, and changed every day. That, however, does not seem to me good; rather, it is necessary that the pledget be infused in egg white, mixed with mill dust. Then leave the pledget until the bone is fixed and the cartilage hardens.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of a pledget, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it; and it happens that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this is not necessary. If you wish, do that; and if you wish, make pledgets.
But if a hot abscess should again occur in the nose while you are operating, plaster the nose with cerate, or with cotton infused in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white. Then place soft lint over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
But if the bones of the nose are broken by a small fracture, or are comminuted, then it is necessary that you incise over them and extract them with instruments which are suitable for them. Then sew the incision, and treat it with that which causes it to granulate and consolidate, from suitable plasters or ointments.
But if a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary that you treat it with linen strips; and apply a lead cannula until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then see if its fracture is only external, and is not broken in two, and is bent inwards: then its recognition is easy.
Therefore, if its fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the patient; similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with it the hump of the fracture from the inside outwards gently with your other hand from the outside of the bone properly, and with it equalize it.
But if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from two parts, according to straightness, until its equalization is possible.
But if shaking or disruption has already happened in the teeth, then bind those which you hope will remain with a thread of gold, or silver, or bristle. Then place cerate over the broken mandible. Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place over the cloth a large, properly made splint; or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the mandible.
Then bind it from above, according to how its bandage is prepared, and how its application is suitable, until it is not destroyed; and instruct the patient to use tranquility and quiet; and give him for food light drinks.
But if you estimate that something of the form is already altered in some way, then hasten and unbind it on the third day. Then rectify what is altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cerate; and place soft wool over the plaster.
While therefore that plaster remains attached to it, and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it, lest you unbind it, until it is healed; or bind the fracture. For often this fracture is bound in three weeks.
But if a warm abscess should happen in the meantime, then administer what we have often said in its sedation, until that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider. For if a fragment is now separated from the bone, or from the splinter: then be skillful in this, so that you remove those splinters with what is suitable for you in their removal from among the instruments.
But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to the amount of your need.
Then when you have removed those splinters, and nothing of them remains, sew then the opening of the wound, if it is wide; and if not, place upon it of the plasters which are suitable for it, and they will cause it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the clavicle, when it is broken.
Indeed, the clavicle is most often broken on the anterior side from the side of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
For it is either broken and separated into two, except that splinters occur in it: and it is easier to restore it.
Or so that splinters occur in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore.
Or so that there is a fracture with a wound.
And the operation in it when the fracture is without a wound, is that you cause two assistants to be present, so that one of them holds the aid which follows the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck toward the part.
Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary: and let there be in it neither prominence nor concavity.
But if you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the armpit of the patient a sphere of cloth or wool: and let its size be according to the quantity of your necessity: and extend and elevate the clavicle, and tighten the sphere with your hand, until you equalize the fracture, according to what is necessary.
But if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has reached the depth, then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back upon his neck; and place under his shoulder a cushion moderate in size, and let an assistant press his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the clavicle which is deep is raised upwards; and then rectify the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
But if you feel a splinter from the clavicle, and it moves, then it is necessary that you make an incision upon it, and extract that splinter easily.
But if it is retained in the bone, then make an incision in it with one of the scalpels which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the clavicle the instrument which preserves the *sifach*: and this instrument is of wood or of iron. And this is its form.
It is similar to a spoon which has no concavity.
And let its width be according to that which you need of it, from the size of the bone, and its smallness. Its length however, also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
And let it have two ends, as you see: and one end be wide, and the other narrow.
But if the disruption of the wound which you cut when you extracted the splinter of bone, is wide, and you are secure from a hot abscess: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's fissure.
But if a hot abscess happens, then dip a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
But a constriction of the bone when it is without a wound, and without a cut, is that you place on the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white. And place a soft pledget on top of it. Then place a sphere under its tickler, if you need that. Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and let its width be one palm, or about that. Then place a doubled pad over the pledget and plaster. Then take a small splint from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the alhihemat which falls upon the fracture and the place. Then place the alhihemat over the fracture as it is rolled up, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy little finger, and under its injured little finger: and bring it over every part, and as you see that the bandage holds the fracture with a decent bandage: and that is, what is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that the splint is not removed from above the broken bone. And on account of this it is necessary that you look at the patient every day. Whenever therefore the bandage softens, and you see the splint is now being removed: then straighten it, and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's sleep on his back, and place under his little finger at his sleep a small cushion at night, so that with it his aid may be raised from his side. Therefore the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by the elevation of the shoulder.
Or bind his arm to his neck; and do not loosen the bandage, unless an accident occurs at the site from itching or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface adhering to it. And add to the constriction, and leave it until it is restored and coagulated.
And indeed, the fracture of the clavicle is constricted and strengthened mostly within twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens in some men in less time than that.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the scapula.
The scapula is rarely fractured, and in its broad part; and only its margins are fractured from it.
Therefore, when a place is fractured from it, and it is fractured in its middle, and this is not known except by touch: then, according to what the figure of the fracture is, attempt its preparation. And reduce it to its natural form in every way possible to your skill.
Then place mill dust with egg white over the place, and soft lint, and place a small cushion of doubled cloth on top. Then place a broad splint of thin board over it, according to the quantity of the whole scapula, or a little larger.
But if there is a concavity under the splint in any place of the scapula, then equalize that concavity with soft lint until the splint descends evenly.
Then bind over it with a long bandage, with decent constriction and firmness of the splint, until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage every day. Whenever, therefore, the bandage loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place; and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And indeed, the fracture is healed in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When therefore that number is completed, then unbind the bandage: and you shall be in safety. For it is from bones whose consolidation is not feared, nor their separation.
But if a fragment of bone protrudes and punctures under the skin: then incise over it, and remove it. And do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle from the settling of a warm abscess, if anything should result from it.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.
The breastbone is sometimes fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. Its extremities, however, are very often fractured and crushed by accidents.
When its middle, which inclines downwards, is fractured, and severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing occur; and perhaps he vomits blood, and a hollow in the fractured bone is evident and not hidden from the sense, its restoration is that the patient be laid on his back; and place a cushion between his shoulder blades.
Then press his shoulders, and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with your hands; and carefully make it even, in every way that is possible and suitable, until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be.
Then place a plaster and lint over it, and place on top a splint of thin willow or alder board, or similar light materials, after you have wrapped it in cloth. Then carefully bind it over the fractured bone so that it is not moved; and go with the bandage around the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable constriction.
Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if necessity demands its loosening because of itching, or ulceration which occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred according to the method of its treatment.
Then replace the plaster, if you see the need for it, and apply a bandage until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick parts which follow the back, and at their extremities from the front. And attrition does not happen to them except because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense upon examination with the fingers.
And its restoration is done in such a way that you equalize the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until the shape is equalized, as is necessary. Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint, if it needs it.
And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inwards: then intense pain and a stabbing pain happens to the patient, like the stabbing pain that happens to someone who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also shortness of breath, cough, and vomiting of much blood happens to him: and this is difficult to cure.
And the ancients have devised many methods for it: and some of them say that you should give the patient foods that produce inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflamed and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we avoid causing a rapid hot abscess if it does not occur. But if it has already occurred, then add to it.
And some of them said: a cupping glass should be placed on the area, then sucked with force, and this is more reasonable. Nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the area, because of the weakened condition.
And some of them said: the area should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil: and small cushions should be placed between the ribs until it is full: so that the bandage is even when you wrap it around the circumference.
Then the patient should be treated for pleurisy with diet and medicine.
But if a severe condition constricts the patient, which he cannot tolerate, and the bone pierces the covering with a lacerating puncture, and we fear for the patient: then it is necessary that we incise the area and expose the fractured rib. Then we place on it the instrument which preserves the sifac, the mention of which preceded: and we incise the bone easily, and we cut it.
Then we bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suture: and we treat it with plasters until it heals.
But if a hot abscess should occur meanwhile, then hurry, and dip pledgets in rose oil, and place them on the area: and the patient should be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Meanwhile, also, let him be laid on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Fracture sometimes occurs to the bones of the neck, and attrition happens to them rarely; and similarly also to the vertebrae of the back. Therefore when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider. For if you see his hands already softened and numb and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that he will not be healed, and in most instances it is mortal.
But if he moves them, and feels constriction with the fingers and the prick: then know that the bone of the neck is safe, and that the sick man will be healed with treatment.
But if something similar to that happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened, and that which happened in the hands happens in them: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and excretion come out involuntarily; and when he is laid on his belly, excretion comes out involuntarily; and when he is laid on his back, and wishes to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal. Therefore do not labor in his cure.
If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
And the treatment of what happens from that is that you try to sedate the hot abscess: thus, you put on the affected vertebra rose oil alone; or with roasted egg yolks.
Put that on it several times a day, until the hot abscess is sedated: then put on the place one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it on tightly: and instruct the patient to use rest and quiet. Nor let him sleep on the side where he finds pain, until it is healed.
But if it happens at the rubbing of the bone, saturated, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary that you cut above the skin, and remove it. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture. Then treat it with some incarnative ointment, until it is healed.
But if the last bone of the alhausos is broken, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as possible, and with a second setting.
Then put it on, and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment which preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Chapter XI.
The bones of the hips are rarely broken. But if they are broken, then their fracture is nothing but a comminution at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and are displaced inwards: and the patient experiences pain in the place, and a prickling sensation: and the leg which is broken becomes numb.
And its restoration is such that you extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture in the way its shape is.
But if the fracture is only at its extremities, then set the fracture, according to what is prepared for you from the setting, until it is similar to its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise, or is already displaced inwards: then make the patient lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. When therefore you have set it, place a plaster over it: then place over it a splint of wood, or of leather: and bind it tightly above which you do not fear a displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
And equalize the concavity of those with that which fills it, until the binding encompasses it according to equality: and instruct the patient to sleep on his back, or on his sound side.
But if a hot abscess should occur to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration, until the hot abscess subsides: and place upon it what reduces it, according to what precedes, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
If however it happens in a projecting bone, or is comminuted, extract it.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the Ulna.
The ulna is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula.
If therefore it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.
And two bandages are tied at the two extremities.
Then let it be suspended from a high place; and let the patient sit on a seat. Then let him throw his fractured arm onto the wood, until it reaches its armpit, in the middle of which is attached the curve of the wood.
Then hang something heavy from above it, so that the assistant stretches it downwards. Then let the physician equalize the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it ought.
And another method is that the patient lies on his back: and suspend his hand from his neck with a ligature. Then instruct two assistants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other hold that which is below it, and each of them stretch to his own part.
And if you wish a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with a ligature, and above it with another ligature: and let each of the two assistants stretch to his two parts.
If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one ligature be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a ligature be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Then set the fracture easily without effort, until when the fracture is set as it should be, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave off the binding until the seventh day. And place upon it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess is quiet: then bind it: and the method of binding it is, to place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster. Then let him place the arm on a support, and place his open hand upon his shoulder.
And place a cloth, and bind the arm to the support so that the arm stands in the place of the splints: if nothing prevents you from it, nor is anything changed in you from the broken bone.
But if you fear that something will be changed in you from the broken bone, then use splints: and it is that you place over the fracture itself a splint which is broader and stronger than the other splints. And place between each splint the width of a finger; and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Then bind over the splints the bandage which I described at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your bandage over the place of the fracture be tighter. And the more the fracture is lengthened, the less tight should the bandage be.
If therefore you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said, at the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then examine the bandage in all three days, lest there occur in the place itching, or swelling, or the food be prevented from reaching the limb, because of the tightness of the bandage. Therefore rectify all that, according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bandage except after three days, or more.
And let the sleep of the sick man be upon his back, and his hands upon his stomach; and place under the injured part a cushion filled with wool evenly.
And observe at every hour of the night or day, lest the shape of the broken limb be loosened, or the bandage softened. Therefore rectify all that by your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have given beforehand, so that the food may be light at first, until the mouth begins to tighten; then it is necessary that you increase his food.
For it is the custom of a broken bone and leg, that it be bound for forty days; then therefore it is necessary that it be unbound, and a bath be administered, and it be treated with ointments which will rectify it.
But if the fracture be foul, and crushed, then do not unbind the bandage and splints until fifty days, and even up to two months.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two focilia.
Of which one is small; and it is that which follows the thumb. And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Perhaps therefore only the larger bone is broken, or the smaller; and perhaps they are broken together.
When therefore the small upper bone is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the lower bone is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.
And it is worse when both bones are broken together.
If therefore the bone which is broken is the small upper bone, then it is fitting for the physician in its restoration, that he apply a small extension with ease, until he sets it.
But if it is the large bone which is broken: then it is necessary that he apply a much stronger constriction.
And it is necessary that he place the shape of the hand in its restoration, and its extension stretched out upon a cushion. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers: and let the joint be lower than all the fingers, or the rest: and let the patient sit squarely upon himself, and let the cushion be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height such that the patient does not incur labour.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a ligature. And let another assistant extend from above similarly.
Then let the physician set the bone until he restores it according to the best shape that he can.
But if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then strive to restore each fragment to its place by your skill.
If however a separated splinter appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then incise over it, and remove it according to the method which we have described in what precedes.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, therefore take its treatment from there.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then smear a cloth with cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage, until when the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from the powder of the molendinum with egg white. Then apply splints, and let the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most arrangements: whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your bandage over the place of the fracture more strongly and tightly, and somewhat more with the bandage to the upper parts of the fracture, or to the lower parts of it: or apply a bandage somewhat softer than that, according to what the previous recollection of it in the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths which are wrapped around the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and let them not be hard, rough. And let the thread with which it is bound be of linen properly, medium between fine and coarse, as we have narrated.
And consider the member and the binding after days. If something happens which requires rectification, such as itching which happens to the member: then it is necessary that you bathe the member with warm water, until that itching ceases, and you leave the member unbound, until it rests, then repeat the bandage.
But if the bandage is now softened, and the bone now removed, and similar things: then rectify that whole thing with your skill, and consider again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the member, because of the excess of the binding, then it is necessary that you soften it a little, and leave it for some days, until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
But if nothing of what we have said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary that it be loosened, except after twenty days, or about that many.
Then let the patient's hand be suspended to his neck. And let his neck be level, and be kept by its own strength from agitated movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. All that is according to the dispositions of complexions, and dispositions of strength.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Know that fracture rarely happens to the back of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers. And it does not happen to it, except by much rubbing.
When therefore a fracture or rubbing happens to the palm, then it is necessary that the sick person sit squarely; and in front of him let there be a seat of equal height. Then place his hand upon it extended.
Then let the assistant extend the broken bones, and let the physician set them, until when they are joined with a good joining.
Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and lint, if a hot abscess does not occur. Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is towards the lower parts around the sole of the foot, then make something like a sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to bind it over the broken sole of his foot: then let it be bound with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied with the body of the sole: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary: that you place one splint on top, and another splint below on the sole: and let the hand be open and straight. Then place a bandage, as the hand is rolled up: and extend it between the fingers with a ligature.
But if a fracture happens to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it is to be set according to what is necessary. Then let it be bound with the sole: and if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it: so that the fracture may be raised, and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, and index, or little, and ring finger, then it is to be set, and bound with the healthy finger which follows it: or all are to be bound together in a row: and that is better. Or place a small splint on it, as we said in the case of the thumb.
And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of a warm abscess: and oppose it with what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to what its account repeats.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the hip.
The hip bone is very often fractured, and this is evident to the senses: because it is turned towards the inner and posterior part.
And its restoration is done in such a way that a ligament is tied above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture. And let the patient be laid prostrate on his face.
Then let the attendant extend each ligament to its part equally; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is close to the root of the hip, then let the ligament be placed at the part of the pecten, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
And so similarly if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the ligament be placed close to the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Then let the physician equalize the bone with both his hands, until he restores it according to the likeness of its natural form; and let the bone be joined with a good join.
Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur in the limb. But if an abscess occurs in it, then leave it for a few days, until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.
Now the bandaging of it is as follows. It is necessary that you wrap over the fracture a hard linen cloth, that is, a bandage; and double it twice or thrice; and let there remain of it a superfluity. Then bandage the leg until you reach the heel at the root of the buttocks.
And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts. Then roll over the leg and hip what is superfluous from the bandage.
Then place over the hip at the place of the fracture itself splints, and place of them one splint over the bone of the leg.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Then begin with strong binding from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four turns. And the more you extend with the bandage from the place of fracture, let your binding be less and softer, and gentler.
Then attend to the two ends of the thread, which you inserted between the hip and leg. Bind therefore with both three small bandages which are above. Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the heel of the foot. And with both tighten also the ends of the bandages from the other side, so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Then loosen the binding over it, while it remains, so that there does not happen to the limb corrosion, nor abscess, nor swelling, and similar things. If anything of that happens. Therefore hasten with its loosening, and correct all that has happened from it, according to what we have said many times.
But if there is a fragment of bone in the bone which pricks: then it is necessary to smooth it down, if it is possible for you. And if not, cut into it and remove it: and treat it with what has been previously mentioned, until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is constricted, besides which splints are added to it, as we have said in the case of the arm and forearm.
Nevertheless, in the restoration of it thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the patient. And if it is restored alone, except that another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he whose it is, always limps.
And know that the hip is constricted in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is subtracted: all that is according to the diversity of complexions, and the other dispositions.
Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely happens, but attrition happens to it very often.
If, however, a fracture happens to it, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts. And this is with a wound, and without a wound. And the whole thing is dealt with according to the situation.
And its restoration is thus: that which is disrupted of its parts is aligned with the fingers until it is brought together and joined as much as possible by alignment and ease, and fabrication.
Then apply a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place a round compress over it, if you need it: and bind it above with a bandage suitable for it.
Then consider all the dispositions which we have recounted in the other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and similar things: so that you oppose every accident with that which suits it, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, of which one is thick, and is called by the name of Leg: and the other is thin, and is called Fibula.
And to both of these kinds of fracture happens what happens to the two bones of the arm: and on account of that its restoration is done, just like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
If both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned to the front.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it below; and it is among those which are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, and setting, and the binding of splints according to that equally.
However, if the leg fracture is a bad fracture, having many splinters, the extension should be less, and gentler in your alleviation.
And in the leg indeed there is something of the operation above the arm: and it is, that when you set the splints, and have completed all your operation, then take two splints of pine wood, which is used in the making of sunshades which are placed under the boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which are of small thickness, and not from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Then wrap over each one a cloth with two wrappings according to its length. And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee to the lower part of the foot.
Then bind the two splints in three places: at the two ends and in the middle. For when constriction is prevented, the leg inclines neither to the right nor to the left, and stands in a good position.
And now indeed let a cradle be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may be kept from movement.
And it is especially necessary to do this in a fracture when there is a proper wound with it.
Then examine the leg every day, and treat it diligently against abscess, or swelling, or other such things. If therefore anything of these things happens, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Indeed, a complete fracture does not happen to the heel bone.
However, a fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the foot, and a fracture also happens little to the toes; and attrition happens to them in most instances, not fracture.
But if a fracture happens to the bones of the foot, and you see those bones raised up on top of each other, then let the patient place his foot on the prepared ground, as if walking.
Then stand, and place your foot on that which is raised up from those bones; afterwards press, or tread on it; and level it, until it returns to its proper places.
Then apply a plaster, and lint on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat ends.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage to the foot, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things which it needs.
When therefore three or four days have passed, then unbind the bandage. For you will find the bones set, whether they be fractured or dislocated. Therefore the operation in them is as you see.
But if some fingers are broken, then restore them and set them according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a small splint along the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it: then place this splint, which I have described to you, under the foot, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place over each finger a splint of its size, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the splint to the bottom of the foot: and let it stand on one end of the splint outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with a good retention.
And it is fitting for you, that you not forget, but consider all that I have said to you in the other fractures from the accidents which we have mentioned: and apply to each accident what is appropriate.
Concerning the fracture of the woman's vulva, and of the pubic bone, and of the man's penis.
When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit squarely. Then incline her slightly towards her back, and let her be held back.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with lint until she fills it: and let it be made into a sphere in the vulva from it.
Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually. For that lint comes out until it becomes like a sphere before the opening of the vulva, and the broken bone returns.
Then place a cushion on her back. Therefore when she wants to urinate, let her remove the lint easily, then let her urinate: and let her replace it in the same way in which you first inserted it: then let her return to her first cushion.
Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed tube over its opening, and introduce the whole bladder into her vulva. Then blow into the tube forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Then let it be filled with lint, and let it remain for some days, as we have described, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and its alignment that which we have described for the hip bone.
And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which happen little, especially to someone who has some skill or experience.
And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself shows you in many situations the right way in its restoration and its tightening: therefore understand.
But when the penis of a man is broken, take a goose's neck and insert the penis into it. Then place a bandage of cloth over it and it should be bandaged and left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of bones when it is with a wound.
It is fitting for him who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as a fracture of the hip bone, or of the thigh bone, or similar, that you should hasten and immediately bleed him if the conditions for bloodletting are present, as we have explained before.
But if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to cauterize it, so that you sprinkle ground verdigris upon it, if nothing else is at hand.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day and do not postpone it, if an abscess does not occur.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then delay its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides. And do not approach it on the third and fourth day absolutely, for you would cause bad things to happen to it.
But if the broken bone is prominent and exposed above the skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it and level it with your hands gently and with slight extension.
But if extension of it and its leveling with your hands is not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument. And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingers' breadth, and its width is according to the size of the wound. And because of that it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity which he needs for it in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not bend during compression on it at the time of operation; and let it have a sharp end, which has a margin at its extremities. And let its upper part be thicker than its lower part.
And this is its form.
It is necessary in this operation that its sharp curved end be placed on the end of the prominent bone; and push it with it at once until the bone returns and is leveled with a certain evenness.
Therefore try to even the ends of the fracture together.
But if the ends of the broken bone are thin, and the instrument does not grasp them well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
If however you cannot reduce them completely with what we have described, then cut it with whichever of the cutting instruments we have mentioned is suitable; or saw it with one of the saws in whichever way is possible for you.
Then shave off what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
Therefore, when the bone is reduced, and the patient feels intense, hurting pain after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Then do this. For you provide the patient with great help when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then submerge the cloth in astringent, black wine. And especially if it is summer. And do not place cerate or anything containing oil on the wound, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Then administer splints at the completion of your bone restoration. And leave the wound uncovered, so that you cut a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound.
And take every precaution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture. For often foolish physicians have done this, and have caused death, or corrosion, or zuchem, that is, pus, to befall their patients. And let your binding be soft, gentle, different from the binding of other fractures.
But if the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad occurrences which we have mentioned about it, and you find pain suspended in the place: then it is not necessary that you place splints on it. And make for them bandages of hard cloths in place of splints, and bind it with them.
But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth which you placed on it with wine. Then administer lint and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar things.
And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage. And examine the wound every day morning and evening, until it heals and is consolidated.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus flows from it downwards with ease.
But if many days pass for the wound and it does not heal, nor is pus discharged from it: then know that there are small splinters of bone there. Therefore it is necessary that you probe the wound with a probe. However many of those splinters are separated, remove them, and extract them. And those of them which are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to happen, try to cut them and remove them in every way that it is possible for you.
But if a swelling or an ulcer, that is, an estiomenus, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction happens to the wound: then it is necessary that you apply to each of them that which is suitable to it from the treatment, the account of which preceded in its chapter.
And that in which my speech ought to stand, and to which you should apply your present mind when a bone is broken and protrudes above a limb, such as the hip bone, and the collarbone, and similar large bones, is that you should not presume to pull it, for very often death results from this; rather, leave it until it putrefies.
For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems good to you; and if not, leave it.
Concerning the treatment of a node in the track of a fracture.
This node often happens in the track of the healing of a fracture. Especially that which is near the joints: and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it. And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Therefore consider then, if the node is recent: administer to it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocol, and acacia, and similar things.
So that you take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and put them on the node in a pledget, and bind them tightly over it with a good bandage.
And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days. Then loosen it, and apply another, until the node is removed.
Or bind a thin lead plate neatly over it. For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
But if the node has already turned into stone, and is constricted, and urgent necessity compels its removal: then make an incision on it from its upper part, and cut away the protruding excess; or shave it with some razors, until it is removed: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains thin afterwards, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, then this does not happen except for many reasons. One of which is, the multitude of the loosening and binding of it not as it ought; or because of the excess of the constriction of the ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at the wrong time; or because of the small amount of blood in the body of the patient, and its weakness.
And its treatment is, to nourish the patient and make his body strong, until the blood is multiplied in him. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Then place pitch on the limb: so that the pitch may draw to it much nourishment. And frequently embrocate it with warm water, until nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are reset crookedly.
When crookedness and a prominence of the fractured bone, or a knot, happens to a limb already reset after its healing, and the shape of the limb is marred by it, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function: then you should not heed the advice of one who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
And there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land.
And this operation is indeed highly blameworthy, leading to death, or great danger, so that it is certainly mortal.
But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it should be poulticed with warm water in which emollient herbs have been boiled, such as mallow leaves and root, and melilot, and the like. And let a poultice be made with a softening plaster, such as properly made diachylon.
Or let the mucilage of mallow root be taken, and shaken with hen's fat or sesame oil: and let it be plastered with it.
Or let fat figs be taken, and ground with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among medicines that lessen consolidation.
And sometimes the knotting is resolved with frequent, gentle, and prolonged rubbing, which is done with wet hands. And let the movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
But if the tortuosity has preceded, and has become strong, and has been converted into stone, and the necessity has been provoked to cure it with iron: then it is necessary that its upper part be cut, and the continuity of the bone be resolved, and that which is superfluous from the knotting or bone be incised with fine scalpels: and let ease be administered in it with care and diligence.
Concerning speech in dislocation.
Dislocation is the exit of any of the joints from its place. Therefore it is prohibited from its movement, and the shape of the member is deformed. And it causes the afflicted to suffer pains and severe injuries.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration; nor should one delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Therefore, on account of that, it is not fitting that it be moved, nor extended at the time of its inflammation. Because it often causes spasms and painful injuries to occur.
But when that happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to the bloodletting of the patient. Then let it be left alone until the inflammation subsides.
Then let the limb be rubbed with warm water and oil. Then let it be reduced easily.
And let every limb be treated with that whose mention will come in its place.
I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even as preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower part of it.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are seldom dislocated, except rarely.
And the dislocation of both happens according to one of two methods. For either they are removed from their places by a small removal, and are somewhat softened. Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they are softened to the breast, until the saliva of the sick person flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
But when its dislocation is small, then it returns in most instances by itself with ease.
But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not be delayed at all: and it is so that the assistant holds the head of the sick person; and the physician inserts the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the jaw of the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side. Or he inserts his two thumbs together, if the dislocation is on two sides. And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he may pull.
And instruct the sick person to clean his jaws, and free them for eating on every side. And the physician pulls the jaw, and pushes the jaw, until it returns to its place.
But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both completely, as we said.
Therefore, when they return and are set, and the mouth of the sick person is closed, and they are not softened: then place on them small cushions of cloths, with cerate which is made from wax and rose oil.
Then let it be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the sleep of the sick person be on his back: and let his head be positioned between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor let him try, or be forced to chew anything: rather let his food be gentle sipping, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound: then let him eat what he wishes, and let it be administered with ease.
Let him not exert himself over the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is bound, and healed.
But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and are not returned to their places: then fevers often result from this, and constant thirst: and perhaps the belly of the sick person is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Therefore when you see that, then know that it is a loss, and very often he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle, and the extremity of the shoulder.
Indeed, the clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest. And it is sometimes dislocated outwards: and this is evident to the senses.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back, and extends his arms. Then compress the place with your palm with a strong compression, for it will return itself.
Then place a plaster and pads on it, and bandage it.
However, its extremities which follow the elbow and are continuous with it, are not dislocated except rarely. But if it is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and set according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Then place a plaster, and pads, and a bandage on it. And instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus.
Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is that it is dislocated towards the armpit to the lower parts. The second is that it is dislocated towards the chest. And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated to the posterior, because of the scapula. And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and exits inferiorly towards the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is little. Because it exits quickly in them, and enters quickly.
But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, namely because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps a blow or a fall happens to some men, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of that that it is already dislocated.
Therefore, it is necessary that you examine it until you stand upon its certainty, and then you proceed in its cure.
And a dislocation is known when it is towards the lower parts, towards the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus. For you find a manifest difference between them, and you find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the armpit, on palpation, the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the sick man cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all motions.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a manifest touch, nor is it hidden.
And indeed, the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
And its reduction is that the attendant raises his hand upwards. Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place: and the attendant raise his hand, and extend it upwards. Then let him put it lower, for it itself returns quickly.
But if it does not return by that which we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and a softening and soothing embrocation be administered, such as if the roots of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water, and administered.
Then the patient is laid on his back: and a sphere and wool are placed under his armpit, which is equal between softness and firmness.
Then let the physician place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the humerus forcefully, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you cause a man to be present who is taller than the patient, and stands on the side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's armpit: and raises his armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air. And another assistant pulls the patient's hand towards the lower part of his abdomen. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, to weigh him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood be fixed in the earth, the head of which is round in shape, like the handle of a mortar: which is neither thick nor thin. Then it is placed under the patient after soft cloths are placed on top of the wood; and the patient stands along the length of the wood.
Then his hand is extended downwards on the one side, and his body is extended on the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But if its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the rectum is eased, according to this form.
Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Then it is placed under the patient's rectum, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood downwards; and the wood is tied over the support and arm and the end of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on the rung of a ladder across its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging on the other side. For the joint immediately enters.
When therefore its entry is completed in whichever way is possible, then it is necessary that you place under the rectum a sphere of equal size made of wool. Then place the plaster prepared from mill dust with olibanum and egg white over the whole shoulder, as it is rolled over from above.
Then bind beneath the rectum with a suitable bandage; and let the bandage be rolled over the plaster from above; and let its hand be bound to its neck, and let it be left, nor should its hand be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the food of the patient be meager until the limb is strengthened, because this is quicker for its healing.
Then let more be given after seven days, or five, and let it be exercised with movement. If therefore it is strengthened and not softened, then it is now healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture which happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be administered to it, according to what was premised in the chapter on the cautery.
But if all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandage are applied again to it several times, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and he cannot raise it upwards: then know that its nerves which are at the head of the humerus, are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
But the reduction of a dislocation which occurs towards the chest and breast, or towards the back, is done with pushing and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining bandage and care is administered to it, until it is healed.
But if after healing heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the infirm person use a bath many times, until that heaviness is lessened, and it returns to its first nature.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it indeed is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the anterior, or to the posterior.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it is falling under sight, and under touch, according to whichever figure it is dislocated. And when you join a dislocated elbow with a healthy one, that is clearly shown to you. For the joint is hollowed, and cannot double the arm, nor touch with it its shoulder.
And it is necessary that you hasten, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess happens to it.
For if a hot abscess happens to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not healed at all, especially when it is to the rear. For it is worse than all kinds of dislocation, and of more vehement pain than them: and very often death comes down with it.
And its restoration, when it is of those which it is possible to reduce, is that his hand be extended with two hands: and his arm be expanded, and the hands of the physician be above the elbow and under it, and he himself impel the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles the hand with his hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
But if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a vehement extension, very strong: and it is that two assistants extend the arm: and two assistants also hold him, so that he is not moved during the extension.
Then let the arm be revolved to every part after a long doubled cloth, or a broad ligament, is wrapped around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it may be of those things which aid in the lubricity of the joint with ease. Then let him impel the joint with a vehement impulse, until it returns.
And after its reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, in which there is stypticity and desiccation with egg white: and let it be bound with a fitting bandage. And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the infirm: and leave it for several days.
Then let it be unbound. If therefore the joint is fixed in its place, then unbind the ligature from it, and leave it.
And if you see the joint not well bound, then repeat the plaster and the ligature, and leave it for several days, until it is bound. Then unbind it.
But if heaviness occurs to it after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is anointed, or put on the joint the fat of a ram's rump. Then let it be bound, and leave it on it day and night. Then remove it, and put it into the bath. Therefore when it sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate rubbing. Then repeat on it the application of ram's fat once, and twice, and three times with the bath, until it is softened.
And if you wish, put on it cow dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind it on.
Do that several times. For it is thus softened, and returns to its proper condition.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation, by Almahassem.
The hand is very often dislocated by Almahassem, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. Contrary to the other joints. However, speed is necessary in the reduction of its dislocation at the time in which it is dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed, or a hot abscess occurs in it.
And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place the weakened hand of Almahassem on a board, and the assistant extends its hand; and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns.
However, it must be considered if the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then the infirm person should place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inside on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board, so that the physician's hand falls upon the prominence of the joint itself.
If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster that soothes the abscess, and leave it, and do not repeat it.
For if it does not tolerate, nor can you effect its reduction after days pass, yet the joint remains according to its crookedness, and it does not harm the infirm person in any way, except that the hand is weakened, and he cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed or worn away.
Therefore there is no remedy for it except that it be bound with a cautery near its fall. And perhaps that does not help at all.
Therefore, when Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have described. Then let it be bound, and left for five days; afterwards let it be unbound and left, and let the hand be exercised.
But if its movement is deprived, and something serious happens to it, then soften it with warm water and friction several times until it softens.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of fingers.
When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm, or its belly: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it, and extend it until it is straight on that day.
When therefore it is night, bind it according to the same account: and do not cease to unbind it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Do this for several days, until it is tightened.
And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind it to that part, and do with it your first operation, until it is healed.
And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck happens to someone, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure in it, because death hastens for the infirm person.
And the sign of that is that the excretion of the infirm person goes out without will, nor can he restrain it; and oftentimes some of his limbs soften from it, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is removed from its place.
For oftentimes it is removed, which oftentimes makes the removal of them to four parts.
That therefore which is removed to the hinder parts, is named gibbosity.
The cure however of it is, that you consider then, if gibbosity happens from childhood: then there is no cure in it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
But in that which happens from a fall, or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken of methods of cure at great length. Of which very much does not return with profit.
I however have now shortened it from that, of which little excuses much of it from my nearness to the intention: and my exposition in which I have explained it, and have formed its instrument in a different way from that in which they showed it, and explained it.
I say therefore, that in gibbosity which happens from the front, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which is done to two sides also.
And it is not cured from them, except that which happens in the back properly, with that which I relate: and it is, that the infirm is extended upon his face upon an even surface near a wall: and a wet mat is spread under him, that his chest may not be injured.
Then let a straight piece of wood be placed fixed in a pit in the earth, at the head of the surface: and another piece of wood about his feet at the other end of the surface: and let a servant hold the wood, and let it not be fixed in a pit. And let another servant hold the other.
Then wrap around the head of the infirm, and under his armpits a soft, firm ligature: and extend the end of the ligature to the wood which is at his head: and tie it to it.
Then tighten another ligature above his hips, and above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the ligatures, and tie them to the other wood which is at his feet.
Then let each servant extend the ligature to the part of the wood, and let the two woods not be removed from their places in which they are fixed: however, let them not be fixed, as we said.
And the physician shall place his palms upon the vertebrae with strength, until it returns; or let him place a board upon it. Then let him attach his feet to the board, until it returns.
But if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits. And hollow out in the wall of which we spoke, which is near the infirm, a place into which the end of the board may enter. Then place the middle of the board upon the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet upon the other end. And let him pull strongly until the vertebra is constricted, and returns to its place.
Then if you wish, work with a lathe which is revolved with your hand: and it is so that you fix in the earth near the head of the patient at the end of the bed two pieces of wood, whose length is that of one arm: and near his head at the end of the bed two pieces of wood.
And let the length which is between each piece of wood be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place, through which the lathe runs: and let each piece of wood be firmly fixed in the earth, so that it does not move at all.
And let a round piece of wood be inserted: and it is a lathe in which the cord revolves in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its extremity is a hole, in which is fixed a piece of wood, whose length is a palm together with that which revolves; and in the other two pieces of wood there is similarly one of these.
Then tighten the bandages which you have tightened on the chest of the patient with the lathe which is near his head; and the bandages which you have tightened on his legs with the lathe which is near his feet.
Then let an assistant stand by each lathe, who turns his hand with the cord, with which the lathe revolves; and let the physician adjust the vertebra, as we have said.
This is the form of the lathe, which follows.
Then after the vertebra returns and the place is even, then it is necessary that you put a drying plaster with egg white. Then lint. Afterwards place above the plaster a small plate of wood, whose width is three fingers, or about that. And its length a quantity which takes in the place of the hump, and above the healthy part of the vertebra.
Then let it be bound with the bandage that we mentioned. And let the patient use a light diet until he is healed.
But if something of a prominence remains in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the application of the plate which we have described for a long time. And now a lead plate is applied to it.
And sometimes a prominence occurs in the last vertebra of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation by it, and it is that bone which now protrudes. Therefore it is not fitting that one should presume to treat it with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that in the hip joint and the shoulder joint, only dislocation occurs; nor does that happen to them which happens to the other joints from a small displacement and concavity.
And indeed the hip joint is dislocated in four directions. That is, because it is dislocated anteriorly and posteriorly.
And it is most often dislocated inwards; and it is rarely dislocated forwards and backwards.
And the treatment of its inward dislocation is this: when you join the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer; and its knee is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and the diseased person cannot bend his foot at the groin; and the place following the groin becomes inflamed with a warm inflammation, because the head of the femur has now arrived there.
And the sign of one who suffers dislocation outwards is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of one who suffers dislocation forwards is that he extends the healthy leg to its full extent; however, he cannot bend it without pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot put weight on it forwards; and his urine is retained, and his groin becomes inflamed, and when walking his weight is on his heel.
And the sign of one who suffers dislocation backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of the ilium.
The reduction, however, of this species of dislocation is such that you consider then if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic in the one having it. Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its disposition: then there is no cure in it at all. Therefore, no presumption should be made for it completely.
But in him whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four species of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you move the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need other care.
But if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he extends his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a ligature, which is tied above his leg above the knee: and another assistant extends his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his armpits. Then let him bind with a soft ligature above the hip joint, and hold the end of the other ligature.
And let its extension be either from the front of the groin to the part of the clavicle, or from the back to the part of the back.
And let the extension of them all be at once, until the sick man is raised with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
For this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for each kind that which I shall say of its proper cure.
In its proper reduction, when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary that the sick man be laid on his sound side. Then let him place a bandage above the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin. Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the clavicle.
Then let another strong assistant take his arms, and reduce the thickened place of the diseased hip, and extend it outwards with a strong extension. Now indeed it returns to its place.
And this method is easier than the other methods of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
But if it is excused above you, and does not obey you in entering with this method of treatment completely: then it is necessary that the two feet of the infirm be bound together with a strong, soft bandage, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its fellow be the quantity of four fingers: and let the infirm leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Then let the infirm person be suspended from the head of a piece of wood which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Then instruct a strong young man to hold the head of the hip; and let another young man be suspended with the infirm; and let another young man push, holding the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In its proper reduction, however, when the dislocation is outwards, it is necessary that the infirm person lie on a bench, according to what we have narrated in the case of one having a hump. And let a bandage be tightened over his leg, the infirm one properly, and over his chest.
Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and another at his head. Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the bench, firmly fixed: upon which let wet cloths be wrapped, so that it does not injure the infirm person: and let the wood be between his hips, so that he is not pulled downwards during extension.
Then let each assistant pull on his part, and let the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it yields to repositioning, it will be good.
And if not, place it on the board, and press it, as we said in the case of a hump, evenly. However, it is necessary that the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the injured person be extended quickly: and it is according to this same account on a stool: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand on the groin of the injured person. Then he should constrict it with the other hand, and with that constriction place it extended downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is to the rear: then it is not necessary that the injured person be extended downwards, and be raised above the ground: rather it is necessary that he be placed on something hard, just as it is necessary that it be done if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying on his two hips: and it is on his face, and the ligaments extended: according to what we recently said.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also on the place to which the joint goes, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the injured person: and when you see them equal, and the injured person tightens his leg, and extends it without difficulty: then you know that the limb has returned, as it should be: then join the two hips, and apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to any side: and let the injured person adhere to rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is now fixed: therefore allow the injured person to walk.
And if you see any softening: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it for three days also.
Then loosen it and make him delay in walking on both for several days, until it is strengthened well.
Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is to say, backwards.
And it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply his leg to his hip. If, however, it does not adhere to the hip, then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all types of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he extends his leg upon it if he can, and you place your back to his face; and place his foot between your feet.
Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers above his knee. Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength. And another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres with the hip gently, not laboriously.
Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the hip. Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days. Then unbind them.
And let the infirm person not use walking for several days, until it is healed.
But if reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with the bandages, the description of which preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the heel bone.
The heel bone is sometimes removed by a small removal, and sometimes dislocated according to the whole. And its dislocation happens either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
The treatment, however, of its removal is easy repositioning: and it is that it is extended easily with the hands, and is made level, until it returns.
In the treatment, however, when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upright: and a strong assistant holds him from the posterior part of his back, in the middle of it.
Then you hold with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the place of the heel.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with the left [hand], twice.
Then extend with the left [hand], and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Then push the front of the foot to the leg a third time, and you pull the hook.
If therefore it returns in one time, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot set, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it; because it returns.
But if the reduction is prevented by what we have narrated, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg firmly in the ground so that it falls between his hips; and you have already wrapped a cloth around it so that it does not injure the patient.
Then let the assistant take his hip; afterwards let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a bandage which he ties above the ankle. Then let each assistant extend against the extension of his fellow; and let the peg stand between the patient's two hips, retaining him so that his body is not drawn downwards during extension.
Then let the physician set the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the sound leg downwards. For the dislocation returns quickly.
When therefore the dislocation returns, and the soundness of its return is declared to you: then apply a plaster and lint, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
And it is necessary that you beware or fear the nerves which are above the heel behind, lest the bandage be too tight upon them and injure them.
Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage becomes loose, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he attempts to walk before that time, there is no security that the dislocation will not be loosened and corrupted, and will not receive a cure afterwards.
But if a hot abscess should occur to him, then it is necessary that you administer for its alleviation that which has been previously narrated by us in another place concerning treatment, and an embrocation, until it is removed.
Concerning the dislocation of the toes, and the cure.
It is necessary that what is dislocated of them be set with a little extension without effort; and this indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, then it is necessary that the infirm person make his foot sit upon a place level with the ground, or upon a board; and he is standing as if walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot upon that which protrudes from those joints. Then tread upon it with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see it now set, and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place under the belly of his foot a board which receives the whole foot, to which there are two heads. Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days. Then unbind it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured by reduction.
Concerning the types of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
When something of that sort happens, and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows: and therefore one ought not to presume to treat such a thing unless one is skilled in the art through long experience, compassionate, pious, cautious, not bold, nor presumptuous: and to use, at the outset, only those medicines which soothe hot abscesses; and to leave the patient to divine judgment. Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from destruction with the mildness of the illness, and in which something of hope appears. Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess develops.
If then the member returns as we wish, then administer a regime that soothes the abscess: and treat the wound with what is suitable from drying ointments.
But if the dislocation is with a fracture, and separated splinters occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and do in this what we have said in simple illnesses from what precedes in their places.
And be cautious according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: as my previous instruction to you.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and safer for your body among them in your time.
