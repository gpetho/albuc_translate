of the pores/holes that come on the feet
Very often it happens that on the outside of the feet a malady arises which is called "nail/corn/boil" according to our understanding, and it is a large, infected thing which hurts the foot. 
And the cauterization of this malady is according to two methods.
That is to say cauterization by fire, and cauterization by hot water.
Cauterization by fire is that you heat a cautery instrument like the quill of a vulture's feather, and it should be made of good iron in such a way that it can enclose the nail/corn/boil on all sides, and that it has thin edges;
afterwards put it, all hot, on the nail/corn/boil, and turn your hand all around the nail/corn/boil until it reaches the bottom of the nail/corn/boil;
and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus;
then make a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail/corn/boil will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if they are turned outwards from the body, and often occur on the hands and feet, you must apply a hot water cautery;
and it is in this manner:
take a chain of brass or iron, or a vulture's feather, and put it on the nail/corn/boil and the wart, that is to say, warts and verrucas;
and place the chain so that it surrounds everything, then put some hot water in it, and hold your hand firmly, and squeeze your hand while turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail/corn/boil, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root;
and let the patient suffer the burning of the hot water for an hour;
then leave it like that, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots.
Do this one after the other, until you have removed all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
