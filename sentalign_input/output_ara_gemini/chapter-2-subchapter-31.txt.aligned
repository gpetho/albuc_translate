Chapter thirty-one on the extraction of the roots of the molars and the removal of the jaw bones.	CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE. On the extraction of roots and of broken pieces of mandible.	0.818007
The broken one, if upon extraction of the tooth a root remains that has broken, it is appropriate that you place on the area cotton with ghee for a day or two until the area softens. Then you introduce into it the husk or the forceps whose tips resemble the mouth of the bird that is called the hoopoe. And this is a picture of the forceps:	When, in extracting a tooth, a broken-off root remains behind, you should apply to the place cotton wool soaked in butter for one or two days to soften it; then insert the tongs or forceps with stork-bill jaws; this is the figure of the forceps.	0.8117424
It will have been made like a file from the inside or like a rasp.	The point should be made like a file or rasp on the inside.	0.773631
If it does not respond to you to come out with these hooks, then it is necessary that you excavate at the origin and expose all the flesh with the scalpel. Then insert the instrument that resembles a small lever, whose image is this:	If it does not respond to your attempt to extract it with these forceps, you must dig down over the root and remove all the flesh, and then insert the instrument that resembles a small crowbar; this is its figure.	0.845518
Short at the end, slightly thick, and it should not be watered/polished, lest it break.	It has a short rather thick extremity, and should not be tempered lest it fracture.	0.67275625
If the bone comes out with that, otherwise resort to these other instruments, whose image this is.	If the root comes out, good; if not, get assistance from the other instruments figured here.	0.641931
The first is triangular at the end, with some thickness in it.	First, with a triangular point, somewhat stout.	0.7365587
Another nice triangular image/diagram:	Another, triangular and slender.	0.48541635
And with other instruments and irons that were mentioned previously in the filing of molars	Sometimes also we get help from this forked instrument and beside this, from other instruments and appliances mentioned above under scraping of teeth.	0.42393064
And we may also use this instrument that resembles a large fishhook, which this is its image	Sometimes also recourse may be had to this instrument resembling a large hook, figured thus.	0.51147616
Triangular, the curved end having some slight thickness so that it does not break, and it should be unpolished.	The hooked extremity is triangular in section, of some thickness lest it break, not tempered.	0.81915885
And know that the instruments for molars are numerous, and likewise the other instruments are almost innumerable, and the experienced and skilled craftsman may invent instruments for himself according to what the work and the diseases themselves guide him to, because among diseases there are some for which the ancients did not mention instruments due to the difference in their types.	You should know that dental instruments are very numerous, as are the other instruments, almost beyond reckoning. And the experienced worker with a knowledge of his craft may devise fresh instruments according as his work on actual cases suggests them to him. For there are certain diseases for which the Ancients did not mention any instruments, on account of the variety of them.	0.86303526
So if a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decayed, then probe it in its place with what is suitable for it from one of these instruments and hooks that were mentioned for extracting roots, and we use a forceps, this is its form:	Now if the mandible or one of the bones of the mouth be broken or decayed, explore the site with some instrument that is suitable for it, namely one of the instruments or forceps mentioned for extraction of roots. We also make use of forceps of this form.	0.86528677
It should have some slight thickness to hold the bone in place so it doesn't slip until the bone comes out.	They are fairly thick, to grip the bone firmly lest it slip before the bone has been got out.	0.7431329
And we treat the area with the appropriate medicines for that.	Then cicatrize the place with suitable drugs.	0.7151469
If the bone has some slight putrefaction, then scrape it from its putrefaction and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.	If the bone is only slightly decayed, scrape it clean of its decay and blackness, then dress till healed.	0.81431425
