O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its explanations and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is weakened in our region and is completely estranged everywhere, the science is lost and fragmented, and nothing remains of it except the brief descriptions in the books of the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are obscured and the science is alienated.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will add the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work, with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is prolonged. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and conjunctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number, and the movement and the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates said that the name without the deed is much, and with the deed is little; and similarly in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things said before, let him beware lest he fall into error and kill men;
as I have seen many times, many of those who meddle in this science and abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he removed with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew that if he were cut, he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the physician, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture over the wound to the stars by strong binding, and did not allow the wound any suppuration, and left him thus at the end;
and ordered him not to unbind it;
and it remained thus until the leg was completely swollen, and the foot, and it came to loss.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come to unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was entirely lost.
And I saw another case where an abscess was broken open, and then inflamed by the malice of its lord.
For a cancer, when it is pure of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove everything that is corrupt.
And therefore, dear son, it is necessary that you know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in many situations;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard yourselves, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your instruments cautiously, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that through God's grace you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to grave physicians;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the other in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness unless you are called a fool.
I have composed this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is of fire cauteries and of cauteries of liquid medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and of the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and subtlest science and the hidden secrets;
and of this the many wise men spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some have said and stated that cautery is a great help; and others said the contrary: that cautery is not good for illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated by heat, nor by dryness;
and he who said the contrary said that cautery greatly helps hot and dry illnesses that occur in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes by experiment.
And in any case, let no one interfere except he who has proven it, and who knows through long usage the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time;
of the other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not go forth except to the member that is cooked, and harms no other member except very little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and cause illnesses in the member that are difficult to heal; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is superfluity.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have devoted to the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I excuse myself for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to deprive you of the secret that is hidden in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels the illnesses of the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on when cauterizations should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is subdued by the help of cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, and urgent pains that cannot wait until a greater harm comes to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as the foolish do; for a disease that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than medicine because of the speed of its effect, and because of the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the disease sometimes returns according to the patient's complexion and the location of the disease and its virulence;
and superfluities are gathered in him by the consumption of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for a disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this falsely but because of the quality of gold and the excellence of its substance;
and they said that the cautery site does not cause putrefaction, but that is not true because I have tested it, and I have found that it is true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it is immediately cooled;
and if it is overheated; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to toe, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness which is called "soda," and because of many humors which descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and likewise for all illnesses which come from coldness such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged with a purifying laxative medicine for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and habit of the patient can bear; and then shave the patient's head.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his knees;
then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers will come, bleed him from there; then heat the cautery which is called "olive", of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move it downwards and inwards, little by little, rotating your hand. Then quickly lift your hand, and look at the spot to see if you see the bone even a little. And if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
Afterwards take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter; And leave it on until the burn is healed; Afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses; and for that reason it heals better.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it will be cured.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and burn so fiercely that one removes from the bone as large a piece as the whorl that women put on their spindles, so that the humors more easily exit;
and one should leave the wound open a long time; afterwards one should treat and dress it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in certain cases where there is danger;
and more it seems to me that I ought to leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continuous discharges of nature, as we witness in other members;
and likewise when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first type of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and I use this method then in the same way for safety.
When chronic pain comes in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills which are called "cochie", and head purges and oils and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have said before, and it is not effective. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize a little below that cautery we mentioned above. Afterwards, perform cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and perform cautery in the place which is called "vessels"; and this is the place where cupping is applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When a sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by purifying medicines, and the other cures that I have described in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not help: then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say, with a sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it in half at the two ends, and then slit the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the pus comes out.
Afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is in this manner. Heat the cautery which is of this shape:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the shape of a bell, or it has a little curvature, and in the middle a small opening;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and abundant blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and apply it to the area for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellare," use the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned in the medicine and with iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery that is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus on the aching area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and ensure that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should only affect that movement and that spasm should not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, especially to one who is not skilled, and who is not learned and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery which has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been used, and the pain does not abate, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which this is the form:
Then prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and withdraw a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place with ink; and let there be ten points around each ear;
afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
Of the treatment of the mouth
A mouth ulcer which ought to be treated by cautery is only one of those that originate from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases;
and do not perform cautery on similar ulcers that come from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of ulcer which originates from phlegm with hydras and purgatives for the head and gargles, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery towards the top of the ear a little below the corner of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the curette that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after, cure the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you cure it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be cured as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills purifying the brain;
after shaving the patient's head completely, and placing on the occiput the mustard plaster which is written about in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery: if he makes it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make for him three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space between each cautery of one thumb's breadth;
and cure it as the others, and if you wish to add, and the patient is able to endure it, make for him one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and cure it until he is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of herbs and that which we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; afterward, treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary to first cleanse the brain of humors and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is strong and suffering enough to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, give him gargles and mastication cleansing the brain often with good foods;
after raising the head in the middle, and there make one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and able to endure it, make cauteries as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-sized in the manner that I have said.
If the patient is a child, make one subtle cautery in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or the corrupted humors and thick phlegm are present, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink which will cleanse the brain, according to what is written before in the section.
Afterwards, shave the patient's head; then make a well-made linen compress, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient should sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then present the liniment, and old sheep butter is good; and warm it gently over a fire, so that the finger, if one puts it in, can bear it; then empty the circle inside on the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient once each week along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, making several points across the whole cautery.
This method of cautery moistens the brain equally;
and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and guards it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the whole cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself against the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood come out, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery is made or applied under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have mentioned at the beginning of the descending water to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and II cauteries on the II temples, and II cauteries on the neck under the II bones; and if there is more need, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and he does not improve, then give the patient to drink III poppy heads; after you shave the head, and you make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids are turned inwards, and prick the eye, and cauteries are made there according to two methods: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then the patient puts [them] in your hand; Afterwards, draw on the paper with the eyes a figure that is like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be next to the hairs;
then put cotton soaked in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
Afterwards cauterize on the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burned in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the paper drawn back, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then put cotton soaked in butter there until the burn is removed; afterwards cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after that the hairs come, and the skin is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are weak, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one-third, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the skin; and if the disease is in one eye only, one should operate on one, and if in both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be on your lap and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it burns like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the area with water, and observe if you see the membrane raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, apply more of the medicine to the area where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burning sensation subsides, afterwards treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary, you must be very careful in your work so that none of the medicine gets into the eyes.
And if the skin becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, apply the medicine again to the area that has been softened by the skin properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, and according to that should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be denied to one who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake his head;
then put moistened cotton in egg white or in parsley juice on the eye;
afterwards heat the cautery which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the form of a vulture's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
however, this which is shaped is better for your work.
Afterwards press the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the matter;
afterwards apply the cautery very hot, and hold your hand to the cautery at the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not falter; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery again, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a corrosive liquid medicine until the bone is exposed; and treat it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is a method of cautery for fistula that some of the ancients described. Attend to the fistula, and incise the place; afterwards put into the incision one thin camel hair, of which this is the form: and it is made to the quantity of a 3 of lead; and hold your hand on the camel hair firmly, and let not the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, it is good. If not, then it is necessary to make a hole in the nose, and to bring back the fistula to the body of the nose according to what is necessary in its proper place.
of the cracks in the lips Very often cracks occur in the lips which are called "chapped lips", and similarly in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the sections, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess appears in the root of the throat, or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it forms pus and bursts and ages and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the sections, and it does not improve: then you must apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and the last place;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and that is not effective, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery, whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterwards, lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your wish;
afterwards, let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this manner, the tooth which was loose is fixed, and the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is coldness or worms, and the cures of medicine are not effective, then cautery is needed according to two methods: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take butter of a cow, and put the end in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the fire reaches the tip of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient;
then heat the cautery, whose form will come later, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the application of that cautery, and then rinse it strongly;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever head you wish, and according to what you have power;
and this is the form of the chain:
of the scrofula When the scrofula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the form follows, and let it have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and apply the hot cautery to the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it like that for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged with laxative medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and do not burn near the heart but only a little.
Afterwards, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let it be the cautery which is called "clavile" of which we have the form before;
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
When all illnesses of the lungs are from cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is old, apply two cauteries to the collarbone in empty spaces; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavile" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the whole cautery which is called "points", of which the form is above in the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After treating the place according to what is said above, and let the cautery have three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be placed on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is inside the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery would be like four cauteries;
and for this reason a cautery is made with three nerves, so that the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, so that there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, apply the cautery with crushed parsley mixed with salt; afterwards let the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated upwards, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness of the cautery peg, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When cold and much moisture enter the stomach, to the point of altering its complexion, and catarrh is multiplied within it, and the customary treatments do not help, then the patient should be placed on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make three cauteries: one under the armpit, by the width of a finger, with the whole cautery peg; and two cauteries on the outer sides, so that the shape of the cauteries is triangular, and there is such space between one and another that they do not join together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach both parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point, according to the amount you wish to draw out; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the cure that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is greatly altered from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in the divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be bled on his artery; and mark out three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the ribs of the man come;
and let there be between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be lengthwise along the body, and do not press your hand too much on the whole cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your wish, cauterize these cauteries with a curette, if you are subtle and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not come to a boil, for the heart is very subtle there, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment fails, the patient must be supported on his head;
and then bleed from the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it reaches down to the fascia, until the perforation is completely through;
after the treatment according to the treatment of issues until it is healed;
and it is not fitting that anyone use this cautery except one who has studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these illnesses have run a few times.
Then he can boldly operate, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
Of the cautery of pleurisy
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of aristolochia roots, and in this manner: Take a root of long aristolochia, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and moisten it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize with this cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower in the part which is under the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, declining backward a little; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as in smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a fire cautery similar to a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain jumps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops which cannot be healed.
of the mice
When you treat the disease of the mice, in the way we have described in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cautery which are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three or four cauteries, in a line along the length of the mice, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have described before;
and do not press your hand on the entire cautery, and let the patient often lie on their back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is near the mice, or the patient's side, which is toward the left, and let the elevations with which you lift the heart be according to the heart, according to the length of the body, and let the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two burning nerves in until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three nerves.
After the cure, when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned above.
Cautery is of no use for a dropsical person, except in the manner which is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back above the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the care of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the abdomen should be the peg that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is shown above.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is dropsical, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not go in too deep, lest the citrine water be burned, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open a long time without tending them, so that the water may come out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and in the intestine are weakened, and cannot be cured by methods of treatment; and you see the patient very suffering and of weak virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to that which has been spoken of above concerning the cautery of the stomach, a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the buttocks, with one small claviform cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the groin, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach beside the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good help.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those which are completely outside below the armpit little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the buttock two fingers [width];
And if you think that his stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the whole cautery [being] seared; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it, all burning, on that cut thelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards cure it with beneficial ointments until it is healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on an alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will relate in its place, such an illness occurs that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, then you should probe it completely with a thin tent, and ensure you know completely how deep the tent goes.
Afterwards, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to how far the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need;
and beware of burning the nerves which are nearby, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply the fire except in fleshy places, and consider that it is not penetrating;
Afterwards, treat the place until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the matter is removed for a long time, then know that the place is completely healed;
and if the matter is not removed, know that the place is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt; and thus like one of those that we shall mention in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and great flatulence, and he does not desire women, then you must cauterize him on the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery iron that we have previously mentioned;
and if we cauterize him in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater aid.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize him in the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the knuckle of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the outside of the back, or two if you need them;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the form previously described.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not therefore allow conception, and the flowers (menstrual flow) are corrupted and their timing is delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the vulva, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back;
and let the cautery be cauterized with a hot iron, as we have said.
When viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and because of this it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient over the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of the size of olives, and let the cauteries be as deep as the heart;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the socket of the hip, and it is from coldness and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip bone three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and large, and have between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, wherefore there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the thickness of the flesh is burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, on the left side a little;
and let the cautery be spoon-shaped, and let the thickness of the flesh be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near them, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four times with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more.
And if the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a spoon-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made a cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it on so long that the leg was entirely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery in one and in the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said, in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let it be at the head as thick as a date pit, or a little less, and let it be between the ribs and be from one rib to the other in width the quantity of a thumb joint;
and let the ribs be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then put it on the hip joint of the diseased side, and let it be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless it is one of the good cauteries, for him who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with interlacings into which the edge of the door descends, and let it be of bronze or iron with a long wall, and in height it has two fingers, and between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and let them be open below and above, and join together according to this form:
Afterwards, place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very much on the box of the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles of hot water which has been heated in the fire one pot, and let it remain for an hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For there is found a burning like that of fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the water gently, and leave it thus for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it three days so that the pus may come out;
and that would be the last aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for him an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter; and place on top of that pot another well-sealed pot, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is two fingers above the powders when you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and falls into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is administered in many medical operations and in cauterizations of other limbs.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and anacardi honey and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and he praises it greatly, and says that no other cure was performed, and that he was healed at once when this cure was performed, and he bathed himself as he teaches below.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with one handful of fat, and apply it to the hip, thigh, and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is somewhat warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all leave and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of humors.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow which is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Afterwards take dry goat dung, and heat it in the fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in the same way, and do not cease doing so until you think by feeling that it reaches the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, either from a fall or from a blow or from too great an evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these instances is cautery useful, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of foul pills or other similar things, that three lines of incisions are made on his back, there where the pain holds, and in each line five cauteries or more, according to the strength and the amount that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be done according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three cauteries or four with the medium-sized nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery takes each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to one another.
Afterwards, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply the cautery to a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is from moisture that is spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra," and when it is of a cold cause and cures by medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you cauterize on the surface of the foot, make the cautery entirely a cautery which is called "point". And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there any longer than until the thickness of the skin is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist two lines;
and if some pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good care and you purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend to the testicles and it is recent, then when you wish to cure it, he must not eat that day; and that he use things that loosen the bowels, so that the stool descends from his belly;
afterwards make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are replaced, and replace them with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and with a mark similar to half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and gives off sparks. Then replace the bowels in their place; and let the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return;
and spread the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you reach the bone; and guard subtly that the bowel does not protrude when you make the cautery; lest you burn it; and that thereby the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cautery of children be small according to their size, and of adults also large according to their size;
after three days cure the place of the cautery with butter until the burn is gone;
afterwards cure it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well sealed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that the bowels do not move when he attempts to go to the privy.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, apply a well-made bandage, and keep it on for forty more days;
and let him have good rest, that he work little and guard against too great repletion of drink and food, and from shouting too loudly;
and when he follows this teaching he is completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they do not grow further, apply to it a cautery of the round cautery according to its size, and let a third of the heart be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with the three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery pin.
But the first cautery is lighter and gentler.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes in any limb, whether from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points", and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
If he is healed by the first cautery, it is good;
if not, begin another cautery on top of that one, for it is the custom that it must move to the limb that is near it, therefore it is necessary that you make cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great help, and likewise the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you fear that the corruption will seize the whole patient, then make five cauteries on his head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape;
and let your hand be so that the cautery reaches to the bone, and so that the scabs come out so that the vapors of the gross humors can issue forth;
and cauterize it on the temple according to what is before.
And if the leprosy is scattered everywhere; and it appears manifestly, then you must cauterize it with those cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery in the middle of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the buttocks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits;
and know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery as the healthy do, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
After, cure the place with bean flour with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When swelling comes in a limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be a little deep in the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and yet no one should interfere unless he is knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease that is called "albaras" is old, and the devices of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deep, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and let it be left in place until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer comes at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And yet the wise men say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular," as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has an illness that is called "adubelati," and it is slow to mature either because of the superfluity it produces or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you see it hasten to mature: then cauterize it around with many small, piercing cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you see it pierce with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the heart, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outside in such a way that the course of the corruption is lessened.
Afterwards cure it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens," and it is nothing other than an eating away of a limb, for it eats the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat the cautery pins, small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing all around until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
After that, treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good;
and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this disease has sometimes been cured by medicine applied instead of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with applied medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the feet, from without, arises an illness which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, swollen thing that injures the foot.
And the cauterization of this illness is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron as if it were a feather of a vulture, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can encompass the nail on all sides, and that it has fine edges;
afterwards put it, very hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with flesh-healing ointment until it is healed.
And if they are turned inward towards the body, and this often happens in the hands and feet, then you must apply a cautery of hot water; and it is in this manner: take a chain of bronze or iron, or a goose feather, and place it on the nail and the wart, that is to say, the small warts; and place the chain so that it encompasses the whole area, then add a little hot water, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a way deep down to the root;
and let the patient suffer the bite of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be completely uprooted with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, then you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the health from the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
then it is necessary at first, when they appear, that one make a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held in the fire, or of the root of long birthwort, or with the lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow any further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there are great flows of blood from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from a burn, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and in similar things; and it is a very serious thing to stop.
And however when this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press very hard until the blood is stilled under your finger, and no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after the other until the blood is stopped;
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not drawn out, or by tight binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stop blood; and let it be tied and constricted tightly.
Whoever tries to stop it by tying tightly with cloths or by placing burning things on it, or other similar things, will achieve little benefit.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a remedy or medicine present, he should place his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it with cold water often, very cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and then do what he needs to do with cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all the illnesses in which it is necessary to cauterize with fire, or with burning medicine, and the occasions, and the causes, and the instruments, and the forms of cauteries;
and I have put that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will go in this chapter by that same way so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there is often evacuation of blood in opening a vein, and in the incision upon an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision upon a stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you that you do not undertake folly. For many kinds of people come to treatments. Thus come those who are so angered with their illness that they die easily because of the rage they find in their illness, and because of the greatness of its malice; and of these one must be afraid.
And of these there are some who give you their senses, and say: Wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but put greater trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely on that which you are certain, and from which you can have profit and praise;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your patients to which health may be converted;
and this will help you to acquire good reputation, and glory, and memory of praise.
Most dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in sections, according to what is before in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness very often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen death hastened; and therefore it seems to me that I should leave the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until it could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone above the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you make a wide incision in the middle of the head;
and let it be as long as two fingers, until the moisture flows out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more abundant, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is below the bone, and the signs you see are the sutures of the head opened on each side, and the water leaps out when you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not returned to you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw all the moisture out. Afterwards, dress the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it so until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bound evenly, and give the patient dry meat from a pot of moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the abscess opens, and the gathering of the water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and open it according to your ability;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the disease is old, and the treatment of medicine does not help, then the last treatment is cautery, along with cutting the two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to cut them, the patient should throw back his head; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient should constrict his neck with the cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the location of one and the other are behind the ears, and are slightly recessed;
then mark the locations with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula from two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, then you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the repletion of the artery;
then examine the wound: if any point of the dura mater remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and an old raging headache and similar things, and it is treated by various methods of medical treatment and none of it helps, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have recounted.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should move back the hair of his temples, and attend to the artery which appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is quite prominent except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, let the patient constrict his neck with some cloths, then rub the place with some rough cloth, and bathe the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues which are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it on that side according to the quantity of two fingers. For if it is not cut, the blood does not flow completely.
And draw blood from six ounces, down to three;
and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not occur before the closing of the wound, and that there may be a flow of blood;
then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the fingers are cut;
and this is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to end the moistures: therefore it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made tents;
and when they are untied, let it be cured with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize, or fill the place with vitriol and restrain it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the place with cold water until the blood stops, and let it be extracted as is necessary;
And there should be a finger's breadth of thickness between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and let them be separated between the two ends, for it is not completely sealed by this cautery throughout;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is milder and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the blades should be very thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When tears from the eyes descend from the veins that are on the head of the forehead, and no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the face of the patient redden, and he feels a throbbing in the forehead like a tremor; and his eye is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and blistered by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contusing cure," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hair that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on his forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contusing cure," and it is that you make the patient who has this illness shave the hair that he has on his forehead, then make three incisions on his forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers wide in the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and be careful not to cut the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the joining of the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three fingers across joined;
and have prepared a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then put the sharp spatula on two sides of which this is the shape:
from the incision that is near the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the skin that is between the two incisions to the whole surface that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula. then put into the first incision the instrument which is called a "cultellary", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side towards the flesh next to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone, and put it in until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to that which appears of the skin, and then similarly do in the middle incision to the other opening;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against hot abscesses coming there;
and on the third day untie the ligature, and apply a great quantity of warm water there, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
When to some comes sharp catarrh customarily, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and weakening of the sight, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that those matters and that catarrh do not come forth except from many veins, and the best cure that there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to shave his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another a little wider. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two lips of the incision and put old cotton and linen tents there; then bind over it cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things that cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster from them; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow throughout.
Of the stopping up of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or something similar like iron; or seeds, such as lentils, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear to the sun.
If you see the stone, instill a little violet oil or oil of sweet basil, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with sneezing powders, and stuff his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upward.
Often it comes out by this treatment;
and if it does not come out, administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it jumps out with the forceps, it is good;
if not, administer extraction with a fine probe of small diameter;
and if it does not come out by this, make a chain of bronze and place the head of the chain in the hole of the ear firmly, and plug that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for many times it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, take birdlime, and place on it some instrument which is sharp for this purpose, and place a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, hasten to cut open the ear before a warm abscess and spasm come;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear in the fatty tissue or the dependent part; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist due to the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine tweezers and a suction device, as we have said, so that the extraction is easier.
In the water then that falls into the ear, it is necessary that the patient first use sneezing powders, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take many stones according to the length of your little finger, and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet from the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear; and do not cease doing this, stone by stone, until all the water comes out, and thus it will all jump out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and take the other end with fire until the greater part of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, cure it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, then use extraction with tweezers; and that is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of the worms that infest the ears, when you cure it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the cure does not help, then you must look into the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, then remove them with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, then take the candle of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the finest end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole candle; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey in coming out, then wrap cotton around the candle as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside with a well-made bronze instrument for this purpose, and if you wish take a rasp and wrap cotton neatly around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines into the funnel, and the funnel should be in the ear;
then put inside the rasp with all the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be a little warmed by the fire, before it is distilled into the ear; and take care that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
Of the stopping up of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to adults by the stopping up of a wound, or of flesh grown inside the ear, and this stopping up sometimes comes deep into the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly obstructed, and one sees it well.
That which comes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many conditions, and in that which one sees it is necessary that you put the ear of the patient in the sun; and look inside; if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, entirely smooth, so that it does not wound the ear;
if the obstruction is of raw flesh or of the body of the ear, then hold it with fine tweezers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is entirely removed.
And if the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a thin, light rasp and heat it a little in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and take care that you do not injure the nerves of the ear;
then place in the ear a tent according to the width of the perforation, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or you take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and sprinkle on powdered vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and use another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then cure it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, soak a sponge and cloths in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.
This athelu, which comes in the papillary muscles of the eyes when they are moist and dry, requires that you stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and the cauterization after the incision is better;
and often they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Often there appear in the eyelids things that resemble hail in their form and hardness, and because of this this illness is called "hail", and is a gathering of moisture, thick in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe whether the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision wide, then lightly scrape each part, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it harms the patient nothing;
and if the fissure is large, then close it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments restore it immediately and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and extract the hailstone with forceps, and cut and press on one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, that harms nothing;
and when the hailstone is removed, bathe the eye with salt water, and treat the area with something that generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease which is generated in the webs of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and it greatly harms their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and because of this they always lie on their faces, and sleep thus, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows because the swelling and the appearance have covered the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains the exinach of each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and let it not be larger than the wound that one makes to open a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several instances exinach comes from the slit, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it all in one piece with a piece of lint between your fingers, from the outside, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is separated;
and be careful not to insert into the slit, that you do not bring the whole spatula down to the eye, that you do not injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply them to the area, and bind tightly with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears in the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the testicles When hairs grow in the testicles in addition to the natural ones, and they are left to grow, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases such as habitual tears and softening of the testicles and albuginea, so much so that this is the cause of the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by a sharp medicine according to what is described in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cautery, as I will explain.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the testicle towards your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then put a needle with thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the testicle where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread above with the testicle, and turn it back;
then cut in the part below the testicle, below the adjacent hairs, with the sharp spatula, from the large tear to the small one;
then pull out the thread, and place under the testicle a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the testicle a figure of a wedge, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you wish to raise the testicle which is divided to all.
And if there is someone who needs to cut a large quantity of the testicle according to how the testicle is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then put the hook in one of the two angles of the heart, then peel it all;
then join the two lips with a stitch of a needle with a fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and cut off the superfluity of the threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting things, for the skin retracts at the bottom of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and it is work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you mark the skin with a shape that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, at three inches apart according to the shape that is here:
then cut what is above with small, equal forces according to the shape that is here:
And if you are not able to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread, and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread near the large tear, and the second thread near the small one, and bring together the threads evenly between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have described, then bring together the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointment;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the wound are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the suture in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of cankers is according to this form: and it is that you invert the wound and cut into it according to what I have said, and then make two cankers by art, and two fine ligatures as long as the wound and the width of the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully join one and the other over what remains of the wound's edge, and tightly pull the two cankers of the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is constricted will die and wither and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and the skin is lifted, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two cankers that you will make according to this figure, and according to this length and width:
The procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then bring the ends together and tie them subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with the chase at the root of the added hair, and make it pierce the skin quickly until you pull it above the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the chase through the skin with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the chase downwards with all the thread that you have arranged there, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then pull out the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it grow with that one, or leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this disease which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes to the eye, there are two kinds:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens suddenly from a wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that suture, and separate the lips of it, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in the treatment of it things that dry and constrict. For if you do that, the illness returns worse than before;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rose water or mallow and linseed, boiled, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent in it, and cure it with this.
And the key to your treatment is that you ensure that it does not heal according to the way it was before;
and these treatments that we have mentioned are nothing but remedies for this illness, so that it does not return as it was before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati," and is natural and accidental.
The accidental [occurrence] comes from a wound and a fissure and a cautery and similar things;
and the method of treatment is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and stick it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a spatula one finger wide. And if the shape of the pupil returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the pupil, and make two incisions on the inside of the pupil;
and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its sides are sharp underneath, of that which surrounds the pupil, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then treat it with what we have said of softening medicines, and with tents, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a fissure or suture or cautery, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares a remedy with all his power so that he may restore the form to its natural shape;
and the patient himself, according to what is needed in work and instruments in various situations.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the eyelid above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must place the point of a razor under the eyelid and lift it up;
and stretch it with pincers, until you cut what is adhered with a thin spatula, which is neither too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer that the too sharp spatula injure the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scrape away that adhesion, be light, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form;
and when that adhesion is healed, they sometimes apply salty water to the eye, and wash it with fresh water, and with eyewash;
then place between the eyelid and the eye a linen tent, and place on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and after the third day use eyewash and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that a nail is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to hard tissue, and another which is not nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and thinks to grasp it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the larger tear duct, and grow little by little until it covers all vision and all light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with small, double-pronged forceps, and extend it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or a cow's hair, or an ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and insert it into the nail, and pierce it completely with the needle, and tie the nail with a thread and extend it upwards, and scrape away with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil and the silk with the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh at the tear duct, so that the body of the tears does not come out through the incision habitually;
and sometimes the nail is extended only with the hook and the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a smooth spatula of which this is the form:
And take care that the spatula does not touch and break the fleshy membrane, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, pour into the eye a little crushed salt, and of the collyrium made from litharge, and leave it until the next day; then cure it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hooks cannot enter, many times this type of nail is cured with medicines;
and grow as I have recounted in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take the spatula, slightly sharp, according to this form: And scrape the nail thinly, and if you see that it diminishes somewhat and the erosion is pressing there, then distil from your mouth into the eye a collyrium made from litharge and the red collyrium and crushed salt, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is contrary in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then recommence the other work according to this same method, until it is entirely removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye by great irritation, then suspend it with an oncin, and cut a part of it and not all of it, so that the tear duct is not affected;
then instill into the eye a red collyrium which is made from litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and covers the pupil and encroaches on the eyelids and turns them inside out, and resembles a pomegranate rose;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you pull all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and support it firmly;
then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be with the spatula that we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small forceps with which one removes the felon, as the figure after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply crushed  oil of celandine or you may distill red copperas and similar corrosive medicines there, and apply a cotton pad over the eye with egg white, so that it is secure from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe hot abscesses;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do when flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
But however, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by the natural way; and by the accidental way, in the work of iron;
and do not put your hand to any of these works until you see that the limb is able to endure that work.
Sebel are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder the sight in its work and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then first that you look if the eye, in which the sebel is, is strong, and there is no other illness except the sebel; then treat the eye in this manner:
instruct the patient to put his head in your lap, then you suspend those veins with the unguent according to your wisdom, and let the unguent be finely divided according to this form:
And let there be two unguents by degrees in one body according to this form:
then one treats forcefully those veins subtly, and wipes away the blood one time after another, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and take care that you do not injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, then instill into the eye green and red gall to corrupt that which remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to remove all of it at that time, then apply a plaster to the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is eased and the abscess is assured to be warm, then begin again in this manner which is before until it is healed;
and this is the method of treatment:
The Arabs call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with burning medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then it is necessary that you lance the abscess where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it all with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and it should be made of hard iron with a round head, and it should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the place of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that this corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew itself and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other device than to return the fistula to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron have three angles, and let the shaft be tapered to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; this is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open, and there is no obstruction or diminution in the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses or scarification without wounding to draw out the humor, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, and aloe, and incense, and sarcocolla, and then bandage the eye, and apply a plaster of bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and double each one fourfold, and then place one upon another according to the quantity that the eye requires;
then bind it over with a strong bandage, and repeat the cupping to draw out the humor without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night, and if the liniment softens, you must bandage it tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and a night, and if you see the eye repairing, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the liniment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of a webbed membrane When a rupture occurs in the webbed membrane, then it opens, and there comes forth matter like grains of resin, and it is frightful to see;
then if you see it opened, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper part, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle in place;
then cut the double thread and tie a part of the membrane around it, and pull it well, then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls away with the membrane, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the membrane on all sides by a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye protrudes greatly, pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches deep into the eye, and correct the whitish moisture and the eye descends, and it enters immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This disease which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling that is gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the procedure is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the swelling come above your eyes; then let it be pierced, and let the light not descend and be obstructed, and let the patient see things as he was used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a thin spatula and make an incision on the cornea a little bit along the conjunctiva with the cornea and the iris, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then instill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then let it be treated with other treatment until it is healed.
of the eye waters We have just now the similarities of the waters in the division, and what is necessary for piercing; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and bind it very tightly;
then put the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the cornea by the thickness of a ray in that whiteness of the eye at the part of the lesser tear, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" skillfully, and turn your hand until it pierces the whiteness of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be at the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal membrane, and then place the instrument to the place where the water is, then press it from below one way after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards, rest a little, and if the water rises the second way, put the force with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, then extract the almagda lightly by turning your hand little by little;
and then put back in water a little rock salt, and lift with this the eye inside. Then put on top of the eye tampons or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind with a healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, put on top crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which here is the form:
And pierce then only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle place, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping-place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movement, and take light foods, and do not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark house, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
if a warm abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on his face a small pillow to cover for a few days, and let him always be in that dark house.
And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his usual activities;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made almond-flavored something, to which one added water, but still I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almonds, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and let them be properly of bronze: And let the heads of them be of this same thinness, and the last in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there grow on the nose added various fleshy growths, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are some where there is cancerous flesh of a livid color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not cancerous, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not cancerous, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and cast the onion on those fleshes, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, open it completely with the finest instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overflows, or an abscess forms, treat it as is necessary;
and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour in vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is new flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must insert a rather thick linen thread, knotted at both ends, with a finger-width or less space between each knot; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as far as possible, and pull gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and many times children do this at school, and it is an easy thing for one who wishes to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull each alternately, sawing at the knots which are on the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and reinsert it into the nose as before;
do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then place in the nose a lead tube for a few days until it is healed, and if there is need of drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which one instills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle at the top for holding it when one heats the oil or some liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Many times a disease arises at the head of the nose which is called "telul", and it grows and becomes large constantly, until it is a dreadful thing to behold;
and therefore it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then apply to the place the cautery or burning medicine;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of livid color, insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not livid in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, look if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two lips to a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, it is necessary that you scrape all the parts of their core until they are clean, then bring the two lips to a suture, and tighten it, and sprinkle on it powdered dragon's blood, and ground incense; and put on the powders a piece of strong plaster or another soldering plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the suture is that you bring together the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the belly; or with thread, as I have let you know.
of the abscesses of the lips
In many men there occurs within the lips a hard abscess, similar to grains of chickpeas, some smaller and some larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and make an incision on each side, and grasp it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the bleeding is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with drying things until it is healed.
Often there grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the wound or blood run;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: then it will not return after cautery;
Sometimes, gathered at the roots of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, are rough and unsightly crusts; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be on your lap, and clean the teeth or the crusts that appear, until nothing remains; and thus do the same for the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if what is there is removed at the first scraping, that is good; if not, then begin again on the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth need different forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one cleans the outside of the teeth have other forms than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and ready with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very high procedure until one has no excuse for extraction.
Then when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you are certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this done by these healers;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly attach the forceps; and let the patient's head be safely between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
Afterwards extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it will not come out easily, take one of these instruments and gently insert it on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with lint where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break in the extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pain than the first returns to the patient because of the malice of the root.
And beware that you do not do as ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have recounted;
but sometimes cause great illness because of the roots that remain, or because of the tooth they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is pulled, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first moves the teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains after pulling, it is necessary that you put on the place cotton soaked in butter for one or two days, until the place is softened, then put there the pincers which are called "algefri", of which the head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not wish to come out with all these pincers, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and put there the instrument which is called "althali", that is to say, a lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out by this, it is good;
if not, help yourself with all the instruments, of which the forms come next:
And one helps oneself with this instrument which has two branches, of which this is the shape: and of other tools which are in front in the fashion of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large pincers, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments with teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients taught no instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a piece of the cart or other bones, or if it rots, then he looks for the instruments which are necessary, which I have told you, and he helps himself with gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that it can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rottenness in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural form, and the shape is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot pull it or file it:
then scrape it; and if it is fused with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron, sharp at the point:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that one can file it, then file it with a file such as this is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it wounds the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not wound the tongue nor impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the thread be moderate, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to align the teeth, take the thread and double it between two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you skillfully reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the wrapping to the point where you began, and tighten your hand subtly and skillfully, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tightened as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
it will remain and serve thus for its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of the arrangement of the two healthy teeth, and the two damaged ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, frequently, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes a form of a tooth from a cow's bone, and one places it in the place where it is missing, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this frenulum, which comes from under the tongue, is natural, that one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head in your lap, and lift the tongue;
then cut the nervous frenulum widely, so that the tongue is freed from its restraint, and if there is hardness or a knot, and this is from a sudden wound, then put in the hook and cut widely that ligament;
and take care that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is underneath;
and when you have done, wash the area with rosewater and vinegar, or cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient change this each night, so that the area does not close up.
And if bleeding occurs, put crushed vitriol on the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed,
and if you see it of a livid color or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is tending towards a whitlow, and there is moisture, pour on onion juice, and pierce it with a fine spatula, and release it from one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you have drawn out all the pus;
then raise the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come in the throat swellings which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two almonds, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take heed:
if this abscess is hard, insensitive, and of a dusky color, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a round white color, and the root is thin, then have the instrument ready for cutting, but first see if the hot abscess settles down and is calmed.
Then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be on your lap, and the operator opens his mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the shape;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the probe and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out above as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the shape, which resembles small forceps; and however the ends are curved, and one opposite the other, and are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, let the patient gargle with warm water, and vinegar and honey, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding has stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils, then cut them in the same way as the two tonsils exactly.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained thus for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had forced out two pustules through the two nostrils.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out forcefully, and drew out a large amount of pus;
then I did likewise in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the lancet into these abscesses, and cut a part of them, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting that abscess for a long time;
and the abscesses kept growing again, and filled the place that I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape (or uvula)
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uve".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round and gathered and is not long; and it is bloody or of dark color or black, then you should avoid incising it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and its length, you should have the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the hook into the uvula, and draw it downward, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you should not cut anything more than the excess which is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you will injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient fears the cutting, then you should use a means of cauterization so that he feels no fear.
And the manner of cautery is with sharp fire. And it is that the patient should put his head in your lap, and then you press his tongue with the instrument that we have described in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize it with a hot, quick solution, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and apply the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And it has on the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and put the instrument, with the medicine, on the uvula;
and the patient should be lying on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine, so that it does not descend into his throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with the medicine and press it on the uvula, for the amount of half an hour, until you see it shrivel and the burning from the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with the cotton into the throat above, until the cotton touches the uvula;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to restart the cautery with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton wrapped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and let it be rinsed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and vervain and similar herbs, and mix all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong earth, and inside the pot have a perforated instrument according to this manner: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of the ends be placed in the mouth of the patient so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is cauterized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula is dry, and take care that you do not do this at the beginning of the appearance of the hot abscess, for several things happen then; and do not do this except at the decline of the hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and put inside the head an eggshell, so that the mouth of the patient does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to harm the mouth, and this is a good treatment as well as a cure.
Often a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue to the light with the instrument, so that you see the thing move;
and what is not visible and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; by chance the thing will come out through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it arrives at the place, it will stick, and then pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head lifted upwards; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough comes to him, nor thrust the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient inserts the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is stuck; then push it down, or pull it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look into the patient's throat in the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if that is not enough, take a hair rope, and put it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron on the end of the rope, and do this often. And let the patient drink water every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I mentioned in the fumigation of the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole is the head of the instrument;
then throw in your fumigation, and the patient puts the head of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and not drink water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully through this method.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech is, when one can see it, similar to curved tongs to enter the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a roughness like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what is remembered afterwards of one and another in this book, and they differ in perforation and in size;
and this is in two ways, one of which is in its very appearance, and of what it contains moisture.
And the second manner is because of the places where they are in the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the fundament, and abscesses of fleshy places are different from those which occur in joints, and each has its own judgment in treatment.
And there are abscesses which one should not pierce, until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are raw, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses which are near joints.
For when an abscess occurs near the joints, and it is left until it is rotten around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or, if the abscess is near the principal member, and you delay perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not necessary that you pierce a raw abscess without completed digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply and become elongated within, and a fistula develop; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time of perforation of the ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is lessened, and the fever departs, and the lessening of pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you must make the perforation at the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears softened;
and let the perforation be along the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no danger. In those that bend, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you delay the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the poison will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and the depths of it will harden.
And there are some abscesses that are pierced according to the breadth of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many slits according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and to cut; when it has become like a rag, and is mortified, it is necessary to do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some which one cuts like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the angles;
and there are some where one makes a round cut, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those which have no head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not draw out all the pus at that time, but draw out a part; then stop up the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
similarly if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore approach this chapter with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, cleanse the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, apply linen or old cotton tents; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must place a tent in each so that they meet one another;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have shaved it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and place it on the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and remedies, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very sensitive, you must apply tents and cloths moistened in warm wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, you must apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
I have now told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the scalp come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are in clusters, like the comb of a hen, and there are many similar ones.
There are fatty ones and those in which there is moisture, like boils;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is that you should probe with the instrument called an "entromissoire", whose shape is given below, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then lance it from above lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it without leaving anything of the skin that contains that moisture, for it always returns when one leaves anything there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will drain what remained from the night.
And then renew the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick matter, cut it lengthwise, according to this form; and put in your ointments, and scrape it from all sides, and apply all your treatment to draw out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And do the same with the abscess if it is stony, and in cutting and treating it as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as if from a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those that come to the heads of children and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the pus may escape;
and cure them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body, and are numerous, and are interconnected with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own sheath, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not want to yield to healing.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves freely on all sides and is not close to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the vein, and is not deep;
then you must cut it open from above, and peel it from each side, and extend the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need to, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and draw it out little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, put crushed vitriol in the wound, or some powders that stop blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to fester.
And when the bleeding is stopped, return to your work, until you have completed it;
then look with your index finger if any small scrofulas remain, cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is not necessary to cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then cure it.
And if you cut the entire scrofula, you must bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since there is no excess remaining due to the size of the scrofula. then you must proceed to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then you must proceed to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas which contain excess, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like the one previously mentioned, depending [on the case], then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it cleanses what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is a record of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that no help be given by this, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, we must cut it below three or four circles a small slit across, between the two circles or by the amount of the slit of the syfac, not in the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far away.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with the whole hook, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the syfac, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the flow of phlegm from the channel which leaps forth through the broken place, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed of which one fears strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breath fails. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for that reason the ancients ordered to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed, and it passes in three days or in four. And then they ordered to sew up the wound and cure it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to cure her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had flowed from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or duct except the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young lady except that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her normal state;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called a "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess the color of a yolk, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or natural has no remedy.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one resembles fat to us, and the other kind resembles an abscess which comes from an artery to us; and there is fear, and it is not necessary to work with hot irons except in that which is small, and prove and search it with the whole intromittent: if you find it like a nut of fat, and it does not adhere to any vein, cut it, as one cuts nuts, and draw it out with its skin, if there is any; and search well all around, and cure it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
Many kinds of nuts there are, of which I will tell all the similarities;
And now it is necessary that I tell all the difference which is between a nut and an issue (or boil).
I say that a boil is heat and fever holding, until the boiling is passed, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and the heat subside.
With the nut there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a sac, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a blister, and becomes large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many of the colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the boil, that you first examine it with the instrument which is called "introducer," according to what its form will be in the chapter which follows.
And the manner of the examination of boils is that you take the moistest place that you find in the boil, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then let it be according to the size of the boil;
then withdraw the introducer, and observe what comes out.
If running moisture flows out, what color it has, treat it as I have said of other boils;
and if after the introducer no moisture comes, know that it is hard, then incise it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it on each side and guard the skin where it lies so that you remove it whole with the boil;
and if you cannot remove it whole, then remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the boil returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and cleanse the wound, and apply things that soothe a hot boil, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the boil is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise bothers you, hurry and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut away what remained of the boil.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds of them: large, medium, and small, to encircle the abscesses of a fistula;
and they are like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those that are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead to encircle the curves of a fistula;
and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and they are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the nostrils, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these introducers, the blades are enclosed in handles, so that the patient does not feel them at the opening of abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a fig-wood splinter, according to this form, with which one stanches blood: and one sometimes puts it in the place which heals the cutting of veins and arteries, and sometimes round, according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble the breasts of a woman;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must act according to this form of this line b. down to g.: then scrape the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast hangs down, and is softened by its size as happens to women, then cut it in two lengthwise, with two similar incisions; so that one is joined to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to the line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about suture and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient will not rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, treat it as we have said in the treatment of scrofula, and if the wound produces matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is sealed, many times an abscess results, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one knows it thus when it is due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
and when it is due to the vein, something is apparent on the outside;
and it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and in the neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to avoid the iron treatment, and the one who is in charge must avoid it also, and in the one who has an arterial swelling make an incision above the skin along its length;
then make the incision with the hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle underneath, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw the artery out with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the place which is between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
then apply the treatment that generates pus, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you must hold with your hand what you can of the abscess together with the skin, then place the needle under the place that you hold with your hand, and make it pierce, and let there be a double thread, so that you draw it out from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the ligature on one of two sides to the two ends of the thread;
and if you doubt that the threads will come loose, then insert another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the first needle, and draw the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the core and leave that which is tied;
then put on a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in several conditions without pain;
and when it is squeezed strongly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance there would be a contraction; and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, lift it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and close the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its resemblance, and its root is thin, and its head large;
and there are some small and some very large;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had thin roots, and were split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you look if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungus is white and moist and of thin root; if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready.
if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie the fungus with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then tighten it, and do not cease tightening the lead thread until it cuts the fungus, and it falls off by itself without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting it, especially for the belly, but you may well cut half of it, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the small growth which is of a dark color and of poor sensation and of milky appearance.
For this is an ulcerated abscess, and I will come to the treatment of ulcers afterwards.
when the boil bursts outward If the appearance of the boil comes from a cauterized wound or a fissure of a syphalis, and is on the belly and some of the boils come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is through the rupture of the syphalis and by the protrusion of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and shows diverse discharge. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and enlarges greatly at the entrance of the bath and through strenuous work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrict.
and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears by these signs: large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you should observe whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you should observe whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie stretched out straight, then bleed him around the anus; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the place you have marked with the whole spatula, then extend half of the abscess upwards with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the ligature be secure;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the ligature, and put your index finger in, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the ligature, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go gently around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you make pierce;
then bind the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and complete the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and complete the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as necessary, and close the wound.
Of the chancre We have spoken in the division of the similarities of chancre, and how one ought to work on it with medicines, and how one ought to avoid the treatment with iron;
and we say that chancre grows in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when chancre is in a place where one can cut it away, such as chancre which is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and one should completely remove it when it is in the beginning;
nor did anyone ever heal any before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where one can remove it, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile some times;
then make him bleed if he has manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then apply your ointments to the chancre, and the hair from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and press well the place with your hand or something, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the gathering of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the cure which is made by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposphagma, for it is a deadly thing;
therefore when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the cure does not help, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness than dropsy, such as fever and diarrhea and similar things; do not touch it with iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and he has no other illness than dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you must act thus: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and press his belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so sharp that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot injure it;
then see if the dropsy is located towards the intestines: if so, you must make three incisions above the groin, directly below the handle; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be on the left of the groin, three fingers wide;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with all the spatula between the skin and the syfac as in skinning, to the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the syfac until the spatula reaches the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then draw it out, and put in this instrument, of which this is the form: And it is similar to a fine silver tube, and is of light bronze or brass, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on the side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the form of the incision with which the scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die because of the dissolution of his spirit from the soul, or he will fall paralyzed, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue signify, and his pulse;
then draw out the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the hole which is on the syfac, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then resume the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering that, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this every day, and beware of being foolish until there remains only a little water.
And if you are doubtful about the patient, and you leave too much water, then treat him with a warm burial or sand bath, and by profuse sweating or bath and sun, and let him abstain from drink; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that it be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then place in the opening a thin lead tube, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, let the tube be removed, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes forth does not leave it closed.
For him whose opening is small, it is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis upwards; and cannot copulate because the matter cannot reach the maris, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the work is that the patient lies often on his back, then they hold the head of the penis and cut it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of the flow of blood which often comes there, and if it happens, staunch it with that which staunchs blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these albathes come on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
then you must take them with a sharp hook, and cut and clean them all, then put on cotton moistened in Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albath is malignant, of a foul color and putrid, then you must apply cautery to it.
When you have cut it, and if the albath is on the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the albath that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the head of the penis is not certain not to be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and to the testicle;
it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from the bark of pomegranates and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps in two ways together: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, it is necessary that you insert into the canal of the penis a leaden cannula, and let the patient urinate through it;
and when the skin is tight around the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or abscess, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the bonds are loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a serious matter to remove this, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then separate gently the two, and place there a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water, so that it does not tighten again.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this work of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we do the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we have only what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around the glans, forcefully, and with a whole scalpel;
the heart fled, for there are two membranes, and perhaps one cuts the upper one and leaves the lower one. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing which is of the glans is not certain at the tip of the member;
and in the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work fails, and many times they are born thus that they have no need of cleansing, and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing which is done forcefully with a linen thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the forces cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single time; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in every way that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and place the forces between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and breathe on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot to another knot;
then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot to another knot; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two knots, then quickly lift the heart upwards and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on and on the powder a cloth glued with a little of a cooked egg yolk thinned with rose water, prepared with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and cure it with other cures until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two ends should be sharp and cutting, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error of the cleansing is when the pus inside escapes at the incision;
then it is necessary that you spread it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is under the penis is swollen, let it be until the swelling of the abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as much as you can move, and guard the part of the penis, that will not harm it at all.
Then cure the place of wounds with the powders that we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts too deeply, and it goes to the surface, it will not harm;
then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from an obstruction of a stone, or of congealed blood, or of bowel, or of dead flesh, or of similar things, which we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over on his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and the patient should restrain his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and let it be of fine silver, lightly feathered, like a bird's feather; and let the tube be a palm and a half long, and let it be thin at the head.
And the method of drawing out the urine is that you take a doubled thread, and tie a little wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the head of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and anoint his bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty thing, and this is not done according to this order except because the conduit where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with all the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out forcefully, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When scalding or blood comes into the bladder, or corruption is gathered there, and you want to instill waters and medicines there, do so with the instrument that is called a "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and it has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the head through which the medicine flows should be such that it stops the penis well without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and push in when necessary;
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, put the head of the instrument into the moisture, and pull at the tube which is inside;
then you will draw the moisture into the instrument, and then push the tube forcefully back inside; then the moisture will enter, and will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or of tin, and its head is higher;
and below is a tube where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two tubes with a good double thread, and gently heat that liquid over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the rectum, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle of it, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you want of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stone, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have described the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stone one should operate on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder occurs more often in children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its thinness;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then becomes stiff; and in many of these, the rectum leaks;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in the elderly, and it is moderate in young adults, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from the upper part;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards;
then search for it and touch it inside;
If you feel the stone within the space, then hasten now to cut into the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and insert it into his rectum, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, guide it to the neck of the bladder;
then press with your finger, and push it outside where you want to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to lift the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the area where the incision is to be made;
then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the shape: And cut between that which is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but on the left side of the scrotum;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and the incision should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
by chance press with the finger which is at the rectum, so that it bursts forth without effort;
and know that there are such stones which have angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
For that one then which has angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, then it is necessary that you pull on it with forceps which are like a file at the end, to move the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin instrument curved at the end;
and if you cannot remove it thus, slightly widen the opening, and if the blood flows, constrict it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first place the largest at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly escapes because the place cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to pull it out, or break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place over it a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rosewater and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then raise the patient up by his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions appear in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is thereby retained, which is known in this way, that it is passed with difficulty with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will run to the bladder, and rot it;
then clean the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and help it in every way that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and lodged inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it as I have said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this so.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
then put the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and leaps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
Of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who reveals herself to the physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-versed in this art nearby;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is deeper than the stone in a man, wherefore a deeper incision is necessary, and there is great danger. And if necessity demands it, you must take a well-knowing female physician, and these are scarcely found, and if you do not find one, do not seek a chaste and subtle physician;
and present to her a wise midwife experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows some part of the art, and instruct her to do what you instruct her concerning the examination of the stone; and observe very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and observe very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should compress it beneath her finger, and instruct her to place her finger in the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the groin;
then cut towards the stone at the groin towards the middle of the vagina, where it is usually found, and the stone is felt in that area; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then put the instrument into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound so that the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and which have roots.
so know the similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put powdered vitriol on the spot, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of the stone in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the spot and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not begin again, and leave the stone and do not extract it, lest by chance the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is subsided, and the place is cleansed, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white humor, which is under the skin of the scrotum, which contains the testicle;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the testicle, so that one thinks that it is another testicle; and that is the skin of the scrotum between the white humor that we have mentioned;
and this happens only rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to know this gathering, for if it is in the white fascia that we have spoken of, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, for there is moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper tunic, the abscess is round with a part of the testicle, and therefore it is thought that it is another testicle;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fascia, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with a completely square probe, the form of which is given above. According to that then which comes after the probe, judge that which is within.
And when we cure it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the repletion of his body;
then place him on his back, on something a little high, and place many cloths underneath him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
then take the sharp knife, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise to near the handle, and let your incision be straight in separating the skin of the testicles to the white fascia, and peel it subtly according to your ability;
then pierce the watery fascia with one large hole, and drain all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the fascia; cut all or in pieces likewise the side of it subtly, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out of its place during your work, put it back in place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if water is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put on top more wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it over the two testicles, and put on top doubled cloths, and bind it on top with the linen which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness and let them be joined by sewing at the waist of the breeches, and one of the ends should take up the buttocks down to the back, and the other to the area of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two angles, and let all the binding be assembled in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this swelling is treated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and that is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white layer that contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that layer with incisions, and scorch it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you have eradicated it all;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this operation is safer; and less prone to bleeding, and gentler than cutting operations;
and if anything opposes you, whether an abscess, bleeding, or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are certain by the signs that we have mentioned that watery humour is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water may run out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to exit at the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsies, the form of which is shown above;
and slightly widen the wound, and know that the water returns and collects after six months or thereabouts, and when it has collected as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in many conditions, wherefore it seems to me better that it be left;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses arise in the body, and especially in the testicles; and this is due to many causes.
That is to say, by an excess of acrid and sharp humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from a blow;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it causes no pain, and it is a serious abscess;
and perhaps it is a serious, dangerous, and festering abscess, and of a livid color, and sometimes comes from a ruptured artery, or from a swollen vein.
When it is from a ruptured artery, it is known by the disposition of the hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you must not touch it.
That which is made from a swollen vein is known by its disposition upon the expression of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this type, and on the other sores; and it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then extend the egg upwards, and draw the white tunic forth, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already soldered with the neighboring flesh, then you must draw out the testicle and cut it;
and if it is adhered to the tunic, or to that which is within the vessels, then you must free all that membrane and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, then you must cut it all and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the cure of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you how to treat it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are near the penis, and hold them firmly, and stretch them strongly;
then cut with a sharp, wide spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with double thread, and tie it to the first place where the pus has come, and tie it again to the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted humors;
then treat the wound like the others where you apply a dressing, so that no vessel is injured that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to draw out the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the section that occurs in the peritoneum, or the distension on the belly in the groin area, because of which the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the peritoneum, or of the distension of it, and these two kinds come from many causes:
from a blow, or a jump, or a fall, or lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the distension of the peritoneum, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the swelling is even up to the depth, because the peritoneum presses on the intestine.
And the sign is, when it is from the rupture of the peritoneum, that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the swelling is variously apparent, under the skin near, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine and the body outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are retained there, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore it is necessary to avoid them.
And the manner of the operation is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand inside the wound, if he can replace it; then let it be supported on its neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum above, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert hooks into the edges of the wound according to what you need to open the wound, and let it be such that the egg can come out;
then scrape the fascia that is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move your right hand into the middle of the testicles, and extend the white fascia upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and untie that which is behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, put it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and put it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then join them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the fascia, which we have said is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature in two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter in, so that no abscess forms there; and put the ligature again according to the first ligature along two fingers of that one, and after these two ligatures leave of the fascia which is under the skin of the testicles the width of a finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle bears;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the testicles, until the blood flows, and the bowel, as we have said before;
then apply wool moistened in oil, and put it on the wound, and apply the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be sprinkled with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the branch which is next to the vein, in such a manner that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess with what works, until the vessels heal;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the scrotum, and if any descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and yet if it remains too long in this state, the wound or the sheath grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the sheath which is at the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture wide according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then draw out the sheath which is under the skin that follows it, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the sheath;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the sheath over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then draw out the head of the root, and do not cut the sheath nor stretch the egg or anything else, as I have let you know in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the treatment of wounds.
then cure it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sheath is constricted, and there is no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is unpleasant to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin on the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread comes out.
Of the castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would rather not speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon should know how to answer when asked, and know the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut each testicle with one cut, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave some of the tunica vaginalis and the thin membrane that is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because with traction, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, wherefore the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and she has above the pubis something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and cure them like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine flows through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tetanus is a growth added to the natural part, so that it is too ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you hold the superfluity of the tetanus in your hand or with tongs, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, that a flow of blood does not come, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and to another flesh that grows at the mouth of the mare, and fills it, and by chance jumps out, and is like a cauliflower, and for that reason the ancients called it "cauliflower disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tetanus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there; or it is by added flesh, or by thin or thick syfac, and it is made deeply in the vulva, or on the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps having menstrual flow;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vulva.
If the stupor is close at hand, then look with your fingers or with a probe.
If it is of thin syfac, and it is near the two lips, then hasten, and break it thus:
put your two index fingers together, and the woman should be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips strongly, until the thin syfac is broken, and the stupor is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it cannot heal.
And if the syfac is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatumile similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the stupor is of raw flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then apply a wide lead plate, so that the wound cannot heal;
and so it should be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other treatments until it is healed.
And when raw flesh appears in the wound, it must be cut in this manner, unless it is an infected abscess. For an infected abscess which is in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood often flows, and when hemorrhoids are old they become swollen.
and we have, I said in the division, the similarities of these, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swelling, when they are deep in the wound and do not appear to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the wound, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then grasp the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then powder on medicines that restrain blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if bleeding occurs, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it and apply it to her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without wounding;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and resembles a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said of the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscess and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary, then, that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess that comes in the sea, which is not one of the abscesses that collect pus;
And if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is subsided;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and supports his back and brings his feet together at the back of the legs;
and let his thighs be spread, and put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good ligature;
then give him a pillow towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the shape follows;
and it is necessary that when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert the probe to know the depth of the abscess, so that what enters the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one softens it with the hand, then it must be cut at the head, with a spatula.
and when the boil is emptied, it is necessary that you place in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dry green oil;
and place the tent deep within the abscess, and place on top of the abscess and the wound clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been cooked;
then cure it after two days with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleanses the abscess and the wound with an enema of water and honey, and then with water in which lily roots and long birthwort have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the abscess, then you must avoid cauterization with iron, but cure it as we have said in the chapter.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife that she know the nature of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to defecate:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that that childbirth is according to the natural form, and the issue is head first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, then it is necessary to press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes feet first, and the body or the head and hands are injured, or it comes on its belly, or sideways, and is perhaps turned around its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and subtle in these things, and beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one must help her.
If the child comes head first by natural issue, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a chair, where the women hold her;
and raise her nature with oil or fenugreek that is cooked, and then the midwife puts between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: and splits the secundine, and cuts with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and takes hold of the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with linseed oil;
then make her sneeze and cough with a concoction, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, it is necessary that you gently reset them little by little; and if they cannot be replaced, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet high; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is lowered;
and if the hands cannot be replaced, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife which is mentioned above, and extract the child, and reset equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes down to the thighs, then instruct to hold it, and make it sneeze with a potion; then it will jump out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to its natural shape. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take mallow poultice, and oil of linseed, and melted gum, and grind it all in a mortar; and put it on the nature of the woman inside and melt this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to under the ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and clear her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will jump out immediately.
from the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this way, let the midwife put her hands in little by little; then let it be supported at its neck, and let its feet hang down, and let it lie on a bed; and bend its arms little by little, and then take its hands above its belly, and remove the pillows from underneath, until it is positioned downwards; and if the child does not move, take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands in; and draw out the child little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child who comes out one hand hanging down It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then have the woman stand and walk;
if she cannot walk, then have her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then have her sit on a seat, then work to bring back the hand; and draw out the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit over its neck, and it has its hands spread, and its face turned toward the back of its mother it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when it is even, then apply to the area a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner for the afterbirth also
in this same manner for the afterbirth also When it comes out in this manner, along with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the [vaginal] opening so that it is not retained, and the child dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as is necessary, and instruct the woman to hold herself sometimes:
Of the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except rarely;
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except rarely; I know that, they are multiplied, and are separated by the syfac which divides them, which is attached to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out badly, treat them as we have said, and let the hand be skillful, and do quickly and lightly what it does; and do as it is best for salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more, up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the wise and glorious, and the physician must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; so do according to what is needed.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with your hands; then you must know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
then the woman should be positioned on her back, with her head inclined down, and her legs raised;
and the attendant hold her, or she be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek mucilage and flaxseed, then let her anoint her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them into the womb lightly, then find a place where she inserts the ointments that are suitable for this, and take care that the child is positioned to descend head first;
then insert the ointments into her eyes or her neck or her mouth or her palate or under the chin or in the fork or near the sides, and if the descent is feet first, insert them into the groin and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the ointment with his right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and insert it with his whole hand lightly, and insert the ointment into any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then insert another ointment against it, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then stretch it equally, moving from one side to the other, for the pus to come out, and let the ointments be toothed to hold the pus, as the shape is here:
And if some part remains, let him anoint some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull out the other part;
and if any point remains, put this ointment in the higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot bring it back because of the tightness, you must wrap it in a cloth until it is all out; then cup it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the head of the child is large and it is narrow at the exit, or it has an acute gathering at the head, you must put the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and draw out the water; or you round it with the instrument which is called "almidach", the form of which comes with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is extracted by the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture which is in the worst part issues forth;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it so that the moisture flows out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and split open the belly or chest, until the moisture that is there flows out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand into the depths of the womb, and pulls it out to the mouth of the womb; then she inserts one or two fingers, and pulls it strongly;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot abscess that has formed there, then you must not work there, but must apply moist and oily things; and apply plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then apply what we have said in the case of a living child;
and if one does not have the power [to do so], then pull it out forcefully piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then apply what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if bleeding occurs, let it be put in astringent water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived upon that one, and the other also died. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to the treatment, and I thought about it for a long time, and I could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after some days another. I greatly marvelled, because the belly has no bones.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and extracted more bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time thus, and a little pus always issued from the place;
and I have only recalled this chapter because, when the master finds something strange, he should know how to help with it.
After this comes the form of the pressor, with which one presses the books;
and with two turnings at the two heads of the two ligaments. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the opening of the wood should be one finger wide, and the edge of the boards one finger, and one and a half palms long; and between the two ligaments should be two additions of this same wood, which are fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the instrument to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of tongs; and have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the instrument completely, have the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then insert the two additions joined together into the instrument, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then open your hand with the whole instrument, just as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount that you wish to open the mouth of the instrument, until the opening does what it is meant to.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the surgeons have prepared them, the work is so much faster, and more valuable to men because of their quantity.
Do not despise the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a potion, and press your hands to her mouth and nose; and if she expels it by this means, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in the pot in water over the fire;
then put one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and hold it there until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the secundines (afterbirth) come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow poultice, and then put it into the vagina, and search for the secundines; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently extend it straight, so that the womb does not fall during extraction;
but it is necessary to move it slightly to the right and to the left, and then pull; then it will come and detach itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is too narrow, we have described the treatment of sneezing, and of herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, be careful not to force the extraction;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then clysterize it with tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and detach, and come out.
However, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass similar to a funnel, and one puts the thin end inside the body, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be over the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but it is stopped up by a thin membrane: then it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and take care that the piercing does not touch;
then put on wool moistened in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead cannula into the opening and leave it there for several days, and let it be removed when the child wants to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this obstruction comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that obstruction. then let it be treated, as we have said of the lead cannula.
Fistulas which come from beneath the fundament are knots and swellings which come near the fundament outside, or in the space between the two parts; then there is one fistula or several;
and when that knot is old, it works, and exudes white or thin pus, and sometimes these fistulas are perforated;
and are known by the fact that there issues from them, with excretion or flatulence, when the patient excretes, and sometimes a worm leaps out.
And there are fistulas which penetrate as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach as far as the joint of the thigh, and as far as the buttock.
And thus one recognizes the fistula perforating the rectum, and not perforating: and it is that you put your index finger in the rectum, and put a thin needle of bronze or iron in the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then put a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or the hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and neither excretion nor flatulence nor worm comes from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not perforate; then hasten to cure it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, urine escapes from it, and it cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced to the hip joint, the tent is coming to the place; if there is no tortuosity and the location of the pain is around it, it is that pus constantly flows from it, and neither medicine nor healing by ointment helps;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish doctors who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and raise his legs up to his thighs, and have his thighs inclined towards his belly; then insert a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent goes.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is discovered where you feel between your finger the pus or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; then do not work on it if it cannot be healed.
It is said however that some can be healed well, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done there, is that one heats the cautery subtly according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it, all hot, into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that flesh comes out, then treat it with an ointment which generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is in the bottom, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or of membrane, and you see the fistula to that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut it from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward constantly, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten fleshes that resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added fleshes, and the staunching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed things, until the place sheds pus, and the burned flesh emerges in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that soften hard flesh, and are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula goes down to the bottom of the fundament, and is far from the body, put your finger in the fundament, and investigate this.
If you feel the tent, and between two is the membrane or the syfac or flesh, or it is close to breaking through, then there is hope and expectation, through the administration of one of three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you put tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the fundament, and the excretions come out involuntarily; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, whether by tent or by another pointed instrument; then cleanse that corrupted flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to repair the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then strive to repair the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament: that will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes there are fistulas in this manner: and it is when you put the tent into the fistula, and it is at the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this form: And I put a twisted thread in two, and put the tent with the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is penetrating into the margin of the fundament within, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger into the fundament;
and pull the head of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and it heals;
then cure the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, make it pierce in every way that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the laceration, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile spine with which one cuts the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the rectum, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the rectum and at the end of the rectum;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and constantly bleed a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the flesh;
and the cure of those who have them inside the rectum, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the chamber, until the rectum comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and hang it with tongs, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a rag, or with cotton, or a piece of chamois; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and dust on some hot powders that are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then give the patient a clyster of a biting and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it may come out clearly; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are far from the fundament, the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are far from the fundament, the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with pincers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until it is healed, and it avoids incision with iron. Then you must administer the suture according to this manner:
Then you must administer the suture according to this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread tightly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to run off the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or in cerate, and put it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until it is healed.
of the dryness of the wound or bottom (wound) Often there is dryness of the wound in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or your fingernail the crust above, which does not allow it to moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is necessary;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping again more strongly than before, until it heals very much, and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of the trembling Formication is a small, creeping sensation around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it feels cold, and it is felt as if dead from trembling, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a thread from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that thread on the trembling, so that the circle encompasses the trembling all around; then turn your hand with the thread until you cut all around the trembling, and put it deep, and eradicate the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a thread of bronze or iron in this manner, and let it be fine underneath and coarse above: not pierced, in order to hold it well, and press it well.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of tin, or of melted or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then which are administered in the care of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those then which are administered in the care of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wider above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there is a release where the belly is tied, as you see, and the bottom is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly where one puts the medicines be of an animal bladder or parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth between each hole, then put into these holes one strong thread of raw thread twisted in an X or around, and assemble the belly as if it were a goat; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let him hold it as much as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you clysterize him for a disease of diarrhea, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the skin is stretched:
We have, I said in the division, the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throw of a stone, and the cut of a sword and of a knife, or of a lance or of a stick or of an arrow, or of similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throw of a stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed at once from the cephalic vein itself if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid fullness of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not exposed to the air, a powder, which I will mention shortly;
and if the fire has exposed it, put on some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by tents, bring them together by suture, as I will say in the wounds of the belly, of the suture.
If the wound exposes the bone, and hangs, and only holds by a little, cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong foods, such as bread and cooked wheat, also poultry, and similar things.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the putrid part, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and that you put in this powder which heals before the flesh has moved.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply it to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it untied, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but so that the burn does not move the wound.
And if the burn has moved the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder there;
but puts on some digestive ointments, or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey, until it throws off pus; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one in the head, but if the nerves of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not to apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, such as warm washing in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked herbs also washed in sweet water, and other fine herbs in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and a flow of blood comes from it, unbind it, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the neck, and do not touch the throat but replace it according to its natural form; and then bind it carefully, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search it; and if there are pieces of bone, remove them all if you can, and those that you cannot remove, leave them until the wound festers, and the exit is cleaned and aligned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, observe if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood remain inside, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and have the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; then there will be no spasm, nor tremor, nor ill heart, nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healed. Then treat it with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, always know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the chest or back, treat it as one would treat a wound in front; if it is large, by suture;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is embedded in the bone, and has cut pieces, then clean the wound, and pull them out if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound fester, this will ease the extraction;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, causing their intrusion;
and the suture is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, unless one puts them back immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they are more difficult to replace, and therefore a medium-sized wound is better, because one more easily returns the intestine to its place than the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four ways:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain it.
I say that when the wound is small, and some of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two ways: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or boil in water squinant and cypress and spike, and bathe the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone to reduce swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the entry is easily healed;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, for one should not cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
cut into the curve and not outwardly, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestines protrude, put them back according to their natural form in their proper place, if you are able, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, put your attention to that the injured part be higher than the other;
and thus you must administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what is prepared, then have between your hands a pitiful minister who holds all the rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common manner of stitching, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one finger's breadth of space, and there stick a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the fascia, which is beneath the skin inside, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two edges of the fascia, the four together;
then the strain of a double thread around the needle from two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound properly, and then leave one finger's breadth of space, and there stick another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease to do this according to the need for needles, until all the wound is constrained;
and let the needles be medium-sized, between fine and thick, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and those that are too thick cannot enter well: therefore it is necessary that they be medium-sized;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far from the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the stitching;
and then cut the ends of the needles, that they may not injure the patient while sleeping, and put tents or cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice there.
The second stitch is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the underlying tissue with a needle on which there is a strong, medium-sized thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the point where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and place between each stitch the thickness of a little finger;
This stitch is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and the intestines protruded well two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was healed after fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, for I was in a place where one found none, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of suturing:
Take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through, leave the head of the thread where you inserted the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inner part to the outer;
and the meaning of this suture is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread once on one side, and take it again on the other, until the suture is completely finished.
The second method of suturing, which Galen calls proper, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the head of the nearest muscle, and make it pierce that place only, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner, at the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce one and the other from the outer part to the inner, in two other places of the muscle which are on the other side;
and this is the easiest method of suturing and the most common.
Galen says this word, and some testify, that one should sew the belly with two needles, where there is thread in each;
and one should insert one needle on one side, and the other on the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, then replace the intestine, and sew it;
then put on the flesh-healing powder, and if the heat has changed it, then put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and the threads stick, and the surfaces and the muscles are joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you have no medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound will affect the principal members, it is necessary that you moisten light wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and put it around the armpits, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then clysterize him with warm black wine, and especially if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small intestine.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is injured, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the intestine protrudes from the wound, put it back in place like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must tie off the area that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut that which is between the ligature, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound to the outside to facilitate extraction when the intestine falls, and the wound heals.
Of the rupture of the bowel.
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, then one can restore it in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and it festered and became a fistula, and excretion and flatulence issued from it;
I applied a cure according to my ability, and did not cease to refine it until he was healed, and the place sealed.
And when I saw it sealed, I feared that the patient had harm in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and certain practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: Take threads with large heads, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the thread has opened the mouth, place it over the two lips, so that it constricts its mouth above;
and then cut off the head, and this holds so that it cannot loosen, then put another thread afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely enclosed; and sew the wound.
The ends are then burned in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread which is cut from the intestine of a beast, in this manner:
Take the end of this intestinal thread that is very clean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it to the rupture;
and this method of sewing with threads is not done except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no device or remedy, except subtlety.
of a fistula, wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it ages, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is haired and produces pus.
And a fistula is, in truth, a hard, white, faulty knot, where one feels no pain, and it is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it exudes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, it is only because of one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow in digestion, and slow in healing, and swollen by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that occur in the large veins, and in the arteries, and in the nerves, or in the syfac, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in some joint of the hands or feet; and there is such a one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin tent of lead, for the lead bends easily around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleanse it;
then search it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and is it deep, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the foul matter and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep and straight, then it is necessary that you cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in moistened tents in medicated water, and push them to the end of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then clean it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the source:
then uncover and search until you reach the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with the appropriate instrument, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and leave none behind;
and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no error or fear, then cut the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then put something on the wound that promotes putrefaction, and leave it until the place is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it is necessary to saw and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example from it and be aided in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the matters came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open it;
but the physicians, through their folly, worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated, and what ran through the holes in great quantity; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a citrine color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one came towards another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption went as far as the bone inside;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with boiling medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strived to heal the place; but I could not, until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and removed it completely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death which I had for him. For because of the evacuation, he bled often, but he was healed completely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary at all, neither in going nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, then it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is exposed, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and place another linen bandage thicker than the first bandage, and tie it over the flesh which is above the bone, and stretch the head so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh at the place where you wish to treat, so that the treatment does not injure the flesh;
and place a hot iron or a heated plate under the bone to cauterize the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to cauterize as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and cauterize again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a hot iron underneath, and then cauterize from one part to the other the corruption, and let the cauterization be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and cauterize the bone where it joins from the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, then there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, then that is a very serious matter, but nevertheless it is necessary that you examine this corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the incisors and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses; so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
The head may rot either from an internal cause or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member up to the place where the corrosion comes from, so that the patient escapes death by this means, or from the greater harm, which is the loss of the limb;
and the sign is that the limb turns black, so that it seems burned by fire, and then rots after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hasten to cut it, and if it is from the bite of some venomous beast, such as a sea scorpion or viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to reach the hand.
And if it comes to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the amount of its strength;
and do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends into the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing off the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the ligatures down, and another assistant the other ligature up, and you sever the flesh which is between the two ligatures to a width of one finger, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or saw it, and place on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and another lesion and hot abscess comes to the patient.
And if profuse bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared in his toe, until it affected the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned to the finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling things to him after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also doubted that if I cut off his hand, that he would not die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then it bursts and breaks open, and the pus flows out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is on top is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not reach down to the bone, or down to the nerve, and such an illness is called "Sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it will not heal because of its corruption.
And if you have confidence that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
observe if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and clysterize the swelling, and squeeze out the pus; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then extract it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the swelling is reduced, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over it, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the swelling is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey in which there is a little powdered litharge; or you clysterize with honey and spiced wine, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine causes the blood to warm;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the swelling is well cleansed, then clysterize with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and it is that you take diafinitive plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you clysterize with certain medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then sew it and leave only a place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it at a lower place than it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place that it is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, prepare it in this way: that the pus may run easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus may run easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the swelling, and spread them on a linen cloth that covers the whole swelling; then cut forcefully at the opening of the swelling a little wider than before, then spread soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the swelling to facilitate the flow of pus, and do not remove the large outer cloth except after many days, once;
and the one that is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, if it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take heed if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see nature working at the opening of the swelling, know that the swelling will heal, and health is approaching;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health is approaching.
For there are men whose flesh is slow to regenerate in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus escapes from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
and if the swelling is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diaphinite ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diaphinite ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rosewater equal in substance;
then mix it and use it;
and this same thing is better cooked and thickened, when diaphinite ointment is not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and grind it, and powder it over honey when it is over the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes one administers aristolochia longa, and roots of lily of the valley, which is like chickpea flour and centaury; and use it of simples or compounds: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; then cure it with the cure of fistula, as we have said above.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or by chance arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and no care is taken, then a hot abscess comes there, and it runs and throws out pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and by chance it destroys it entirely;
and the corrosion goes down to the bone, until there comes a stinking pain, and the head of the finger is swollen, and its color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the section, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must put a probe under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and put on the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupt, cut it in an I shape as previously mentioned, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is injured and swollen, and it causes great pain, you must first cleanse it;
then cut the nail of the whitlow with a sharp scalpel, cutting across from above, and take care that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it does happen, apply something soothing.
The extra fingers which grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and by chance there are some in which there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the knuckles of the fingers.
That which grows on any knuckle of a finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of a finger, perhaps moves;
the treatment of that which is fleshy is light, in this manner: cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: then be careful of cutting.
In that which grows on the finger at the last joint, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh roundly to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The adhesion that occurs between fingers comes from growth, or from the closing of a wound, or from a burn, or from similar things.
Then you must cut that adhesion, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, that they may not adhere; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as it should be.
If adhesion occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that adhesion as is necessary.
Varices are large swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you must sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood flows out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair, then put him in the bath, and pour warm water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then heat it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the knee to the ankle;
then open the skin with an incision, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put the instrument underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then hang it lightly on the hook, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the instrument, as you have done, and hang it on another hook, as you did first;
then cut another section, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second section;
then pull it out section by section, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong double thread in it, and tie it and pull it, and put an instrument underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull it out or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the screw is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it forcefully, but not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the screw is curved, and does not cut, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of thick curvature, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms, generated between skin and flesh, arise within the body.
And if the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very great inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time that a point emerges outside, wrap it around the lead and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is entirely emerged; for if you cut it, it re-enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad illness;
for which reason it is necessary that it be treated little by little to the end, and that nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe in the opening, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter that is inside be emptied, and administer to the place medicines preventing putrefaction for some days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and there are many openings, from which pus flows;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and one feels it well going from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and pus flows;
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and lumbríci and ascárides are in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and pull, then one can only pull it out when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong ligature tightly, then cut it above and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does, is that it runs to the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, then press down firmly on the eyebrow below it, then cut above, and pull it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily cleansing with purgative medicines for the bad putrid humors, and to abstain from foods causing putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little later, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and fixed itself in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly turned around her body, as I saw it.
I greatly marveled how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had felt pain move from place to place, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins uncovered, and because of this, that constrained windiness appeared;
and it does not appear for this reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and covered veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then bind it above and below quickly, and then cut above until that constrained windiness escapes from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels windiness, such as fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they fall.
Their diversity is that there are some which have large points, and small ones, and barbed ones, and smooth ones; and some that have two angles, and some that have barbs, and some which are broken;
and that which falls in a limb falls in two ways: or in a principal member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then falls in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall tell you hereafter, appear: then you must avoid extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then I draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs of injury to the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is over the brain is injured, are when there is scotoma and thirst and vertigo and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound comes a white moisture resembling pus, and also something like shreds of flesh;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs that the arrow has struck the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were fixed in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and there is coldness and cold sweat, and syncope; know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the signs that the arrow has injured the lung are that frothy spittle comes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and he breathes heavily and feels great pain and sighs; and all the muscles of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some dung comes out through the ruptured intestine, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out and flows, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the arm and the spine of the back and the breastbone and the thigh and the legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I shall tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew out at one time an arrow that struck him in the fatty tissue of the eye under the eyelid; and the arrow was embedded, and I could reach only the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with barbs:
I sawed the barbs, and worked so delicately that I drew it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and then when thirty days had passed, his condition did not change; I cut on the arrow, and grasped it, and drew it forth, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man from whom an arrow fell into his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow fell, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without suffering great pain;
and many others similar.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning towards the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen in three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I searched it with a very fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the place, so that the place would not swell; and the place of the arrow appeared to me.
and the place of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there for many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus for a long time, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose;
and he told me so. I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared to me visibly;
and a period of about four months passed, and then I widened the wound so that I inserted the forceps, and moved it from one side to the other, but it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise means of instruments, until I took it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will be at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the surgeons judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of some arrows, so that you apply your care to what I do not say, for a book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master learns from very little, and from what is present and lacking to him, finds new work, and a new instrument, for the treatment of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are fixed except according to two ways: either by the place where they entered, or by another part;
and that which leaps out by the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaping out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is rotten, and the exit is made easier;
and also if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, pierce all around with a thin drill, until the place around is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in the body such that one cannot see it, search for it with a tent. and if you feel it, pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein, enlarge the wound;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, remove the flesh that is pierced on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, as you would then remove it with greater difficulty.
And if you cannot at once, leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, use what we have said in its chapter concerning treatment;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise a way how you can remove the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and position the patient as he was when the arrow entered, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it is visible, or the skin is swollen where it is clearly seen or felt:
then cut above it, until the forceps can grasp it, and then extract it: if it leaps out immediately.
And if it is lodged in the bone, rotate your hand round and round until it enters the bone and widens it, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for a while, and then resume extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, remove it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer extraction, use a hollow instrument so that the point of the arrow enters the hollow of the instrument;
and then pull it out, and if the arrow is broken, use a pointed instrument going in, to facilitate the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can, then treat the wound as needed.
And if the arrow breaks in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is close to the surface, and you can cut to it, cut.
and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows resembles a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like the feather of a bird, to push at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
There are 31 veins from which one is bled, of which there are 16 in the head, that is to say: Two temples which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "fast", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "vein of the belly", and it is on the forearm, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which clearly appears on the wrist.
And the salvatiella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nase", which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old cataracts and with migraine;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then seek them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and put it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand with the entire vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers across, and let out blood as much as you wish;
then constrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding of the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and toothache, and habitual ophthalmia, and for a flow of hot tears from the eyes;
and the quality of the bloodletting is as I said: and it is that the patient should constrict his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from there;
then lift the skin above the vein up to your index finger, and put the lancet underneath, and lift the vein up, and cup it, as you have done in the two other veins, and let blood flow according to your need;
then unbind the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put on cotton; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the frontal vein is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial ailments, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the quality is that the patient strains his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "lancet," of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you wish; then untie the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work is done with a broad blade.
However, it is not necessary that the blade be too sharp; and cut across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the blade will break when it is thin.
The bloodletting of the two veins that are in the two temples helps with them, and with ringworm, and with redness, and with hordeolum in the eye, and with diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bloodletting is that the patient constricts his neck by twisting with some linen, as before;
then bleed him, and let the bloodletting be across, a little of the length of the blade a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the blade is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for fever, and for raging thirst, and for facial illnesses, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, and especially when it is chronic;
and the manner of bleeding is that the patient grasps his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin blade, and insert it between the lips in the space that is between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then bind it overnight, for it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two temples helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and many illnesses, and impetigo, and toothache, and herpes, and fistulas;
and the manner of bleeding is that the patient grasps his neck under one side and the other, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the head of the patient, and the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein lengthwise a little broadly, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do likewise in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of the bleeding of the lips Bleeding from the veins of the upper lip helps with a boil in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the quality of the bleeding is to make the patient sit before you, and bind his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are known because they are black, and because around them are small black veins:
cut then one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts his tongue, and looks underneath on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the neck from which one commonly bleeds are bled according to two methods:
either by piercing with a completely flat, wide blade, or an olive-shaped, thin one like a cutting lancet, and it is called "anesil"; and are wide and thin according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the flat blade is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is necessary for opening the full neck veins of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and turbid blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped blade:
and is more subtly pointed, and is for bleeding the thin veins, where there is thin, yellowish blood.
Bleeding from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the abdomen;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleeds wisely, and that he guards against the artery which is underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it is necessary to staunch it, as I have said; and the lancet should not be pointed, but cutting like a chisel.
And if the basilica vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary that you search for it, and choose another; or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut with a chisel-shaped lancet, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, it is necessary that you extend the arm, that you touch the place until you know the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with the chisel-shaped lancet; and beware that you do not strike the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is arterial blood: hasten yourself then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if it is the arm, bind it, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and let it be without fear, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stanched, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the head of it retracts; and stanch the blood.
And take a piece of bark from a fig tree, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on well until the next day;
if the blood stanches, it is well; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stanch blood;
and the stanching is not difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound, and the power of the ligament of the arm.
The bloodletting of the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be careful of the nerve which is below, and if he goes too deep, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps cannot be healed;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men because of its subtlety, then you must bleed it with a lancet; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by puncturing the olivary vein or the myrtle vein, for this is the safest of all veins, because beneath it there is neither nerve nor artery. However, one must seek the lightest place, and it matters not if one fails the first time, and one begins again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one fails the first time, but it matters not.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that bloodletting is administered only to preserve health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the neck: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting which is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but when need is, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and it is not fitting to bleed children until fourteen years, nor a woman carrying a child except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor those with dropsy;
and one should beware of bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and frequent intercourse with a woman, and toil, wakefulness and fasting, and anything that weakens, whether by something of the mind or of the body;
then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed him from the vein of the arm around the third, as we have said;
and keep him that day from work, and pain, and lust, and similar things;
and be cheerful and happy, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature moderately above, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then puts his finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not slip and escape when struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when being bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one puts on the lancet, it withdraws from the lancet, and cannot open the vein, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be skilled in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, then begin again a little below that place or above quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it a day or two, and do not bind the arm: by chance, an abscess will form there;
and do not enter the bath, then resume bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you doubt that enough blood will come out as you wish, then thrust into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work somewhat quickly, before the place becomes swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not resume bleeding, and put on a little of lye of oil, for it lightens the body of the blood, and lye is milder in this place than oil;
and thus administer the lye of oil in each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and this same thing does theriac and ox-gall, when one puts it on the place; so it thins the blood and it separates when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms there, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled except at that time when the opening of the vein is small, hurry, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and a little warm vinegar, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the issue of blood from the vein, and if there remains at the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mint, or similar.
And many times an abscess and appearance occur at the bleeding of the basilica vein:
Then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the compression of the hand, then that appearance is bad. Avoid then that you put on nothing of that which we have said, for perhaps it cuts off the artery;
but make a dry plaster for it to harden the place, then cure it with another cure, until it is healed.
And draw from each one blood according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let out so much until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it out until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made for him, and the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and it is necessary to bleed him little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding is safe from the flow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or across.
And to one whose body fails during bleeding, it is necessary to give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is heated, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bleeding bread soaked in quince syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the loss of much blood, it is necessary that he drink broth of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the section or chapter on syncope, for the opening of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm, and bleed another time, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to bleed from another place, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; therefore it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and widen the opening until it flows in a stream; then, when you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, that death may not come instead of a stream, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary, when you wish to untie the arm, and cause blood to flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is curved, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be harmful;
but let him be until he bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of a flame, until the blood which is congealed at the opening of the vein flows out freely, and put on it a little salt dissolved in water, and press lightly upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is subsided.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the arm is bled in place of the vein in the head because it is composed [in a similar way].
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the vein is red;
then it is bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not across the width or length;
and let the opening be wide, and bleed very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for one puts it in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the method:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, completely bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is needed, put oil and salt on the vein to quickly cauterize, and do so for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the head, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphena vein is good for all the illnesses that are in the lower body, such as diseases of the womb, and the retention of menses, and disease of the kidneys, and of the thighs and old legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it swells, and binds above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot many branches go;
bleed then from the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is most effective.
And if you bleed it on the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed across as if cutting;
and let the blade be sharp.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, start again a little higher up, for the place is salty;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and bleeding it is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and presses above the ankle with four fingers twisting, because otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, because the location is safe, and it is very abundant in many men.
and it is better that you cut it, because the location is safe, and it is very abundant in many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and venesection is done in two ways: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this venesection which is without cutting is done in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and venesection which is done by cutting and by the extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and the other is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and the cuppings between the two arms; and the cuppings on the two legs; and the cuppings on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bleeding from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or for custom, then we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle, and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order cupping after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temple helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary that one who is of cold complexion use it, or who has a catarrh, for it does them great harm;
and therefore it is not necessary that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold diseases in the head.
And he who is often bled in this way becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower because of the danger of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for the constriction of the chest, and for a fissure in the windpipe, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or harm to the stomach and heart.
Cupping at the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to extend the arm when applying the cups, so that he does not cut the artery and cause a great flow of blood.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and congestion.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins;
and instruct the physician not to go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries underneath.
The cupping glass that is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the rectum, and for diseases below, and the cupping glass must be large, and of brass, that it may draw well; and perchance, if it were thin, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
The cupping glasses of the legs are manifestly healing, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the womb, and of the bladder, and they restore the menses;
and are placed on the two shinbones, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many constitutions.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and reapply the cupping glasses, and take heed of the constitution of the bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the passage of thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw blood little by little, one time is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the excess is thick and cold, take wormwood oil, or balm oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one whom one heals has tender flesh and large pores, then it is not necessary to put any oil there, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And the one who has much moisture, should be washed with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick excesses should be washed with old wine, or beet juice, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or others similar;
and one should not use cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath, one or two hours;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be careful, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chicken, and mutton, and moist meats.
and eat chicken, and mutton, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chicken and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he is cupped, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after cupping, to strengthen the principal members; and the blood should be thinned, but it is not necessary for those who are hot to drink it.
The cupping glasses which are applied without cutting are those which are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the breast and the kidneys and the hip, for these members do not tolerate being cut, and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another, just as we apply them to the breasts when the milk flows;
to remove the viscosity which is in the member, just as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the breast to soften the member;
and removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are applied empty to suck only; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as for inserting a needle, and let it be of bronze, smooth in front so that it does not wound the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to put a burning candle in, and let there be large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who receive them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of old people, and of thin people from those of fat people.
And one should thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and put it into the cupping glass across the bar which is in the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor goes out, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with hot water, there is no bar or hole, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only;
and this is the form:
Leech application is only administered to limbs where cupping glasses cannot be applied due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and others similar;
and the quality of the leech is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh water without putrefaction, you should take them;
and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry and have nothing in their bellies; and then having bled the vein and cupped, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for this is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then sprinkle it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches fall off, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it, until the bleeding is stopped;
and if the bleeding is profuse, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you may place on the area halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the area; this will stop the bleeding immediately;
and if you need more, apply more leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood flows, and then apply them; as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they fall off, sprinkle a little aloe and salt, crushed, or ashes, on them; they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that the foolish scoff at this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letter of them;
and for this reason the science is diminished in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of the ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and by experiment, and by the custom of my life;
and I have described to you in this chapter that which is contained, and I have shortened it at the end, and I have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary, then, that we say in the prologue of this book the sum of the words and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and remains on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or contusion comes to anyone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or an infant, or an old man; or if the time is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold foods, that is to say cold pottage, and the flesh of birds and of kids, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no fear of a hot abscess, or of the spread of matter to the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bones begin to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that produce great nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and tripe of a cow, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the flesh grows again and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of old and decrepit people cannot be well mended or healed according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but there is a cure, reset the broken bone with thick bandages that support and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not cease from this work, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish him with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another lengthwise, like the shaft of a writing pen.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another lengthwise, like the shaft of a writing pen. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small fissure.
And each type has its own device and proper instrument in its restoration, according to what the memory brings to its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known because the place is twisted, and it appears clearly by swelling, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be a twisting, or fissure, or small fracture. Then you must not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that follow, and then hold it firmly and subtly.
And know that for a fracture that goes spirally, and the two parts are disjointed, you must immediately set them evenly, so that abscesses do not form there;
and if hot abscesses form there, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are subsided;
then set it evenly so that you can gently and wisely move it, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then hold it, as is necessary later.
And if the bone is broken into pieces, extend it from two sides, if it is the hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural form, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you bring back by all means the additions to their places as best you can, and ensure that your work does not cause injury or pain to the patient;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
then straighten it nicely, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is in place, instruct the patient well not to move it, neither awake nor asleep, nor by turning, nor in any other way; and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is put straight, so that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the qualities of the broken limb are as I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar: then it is necessary to wrap it with soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap it with a wide and strong linen, for the wide linen embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it equally on all sides, so that there is no slack;
then bind around light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole linen, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture may then remove the fracture a little;
and soften the linen little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another linen, and turn it around again over the broken area;
then return to the part below the fracture, and bind moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the linen bandages tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind all over with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and which removes the swelling, and leave it thus for some days;
then bind on your splints, and let them be half of a wisely sawn broad cane, or of wood from which cleavers are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then bind on the splints as you did in the first binding, then bind over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less so;
and it is necessary that the threads be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there be less than the width of a finger between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the ends of the splints after the tightening in healthy places, then put under them linen or carded wool padding, so that he is not injured.
When the wound is accompanied by a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints except after five days or seven, or more depending on your certainty of a hot abscess developing;
And here is the manner of the ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with plenty of egg, and apply this confection, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring the fracture in many conditions, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: take 3 parts of barley and ladanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and mugwort, of each 10 parts; myrrh and aloes, of each 5 parts; comfrey 9 parts; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; if the man's complexion is warm, he should use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is of use to many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for a sprain: take mugwort and mallow, each 10 parts; myrrh and aloes, each 9 parts; acacia 6 parts; Armenian bole 10 parts, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another type of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their place, and soothes the resulting pain, and the splintering and breakage of the bone: Take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and boiled oil, and apply it to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes the pains.
Another type of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of ground poppy, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and to diminish the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, bean flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, and flaxseed, balausta, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all these one part each; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its condition.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put anything on a broken limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to think that one should put on a broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloe and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another kind of plaster which is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and mix them equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it on.
And then unbind it a little afterwards, and take care that the patient feels no pain, and that the bone has not moved from its place; if not, unbind it in several days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, or restlessness or swelling, hasten, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a wet sea sponge, and dip it in water, and bathe the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened with water or rose oil, and bind it on a nut, until you are sure of a warm abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then recommence the subtle binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need plaster and binding, then recommence it, as you did at first equally.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, then do not unbind it before III or IIII or V or VII days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture mends, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then bind it more tightly than before, and it thickens its flesh, as I said before;
and if you see the place drying more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it; then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and that should be every third day, and loosen the binding a little;
by this work then nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly mends what the foolish healers do, who bind the limb too tightly:
that is bad, and it is a dangerous practice, and I see nothing else but leaving it alone and working correctly.
Many kinds of fractures there are, and diverse forms, and the causes are different;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks the whole bone down to the spongy bone which is beneath the bone, as does a hatchet or club; and for this reason this manner of fracture is called "hatchet-fracture".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this manner of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt impact, or a fissure, or a neck-fracture from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or from similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is located in the bone as fine as a hair, and the fissure is small, and therefore this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and causes a piece of the bone to enter, and the place is swollen as the cauldrons do when they are struck. If the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones in the head, such as the heads of children;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh which is on top.
The hair-like resemblance is known by this, that when the bone has been uncovered, and one rubs against it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the accidents of the patient, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and extension, and faintness, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar things in many conditions, it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening accident, and you hope for salvation, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the accidents that we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, it is necessary that you split the fractured part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and the area of the wound as gently as possible, and if bleeding occurs upon uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the area with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are assured of the cessation of bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of working:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you make a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and should be of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you make incisions with a trephine, not so deeply that it pierces through the skull bone, and it should have above the point a margin or a circle, which prevents the point from passing beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes in its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have trephines for the whole head;
and this is the form of the three types of trephines:
The method for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a trephine on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the trephine elsewhere a little afterwards, and so do all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you remove the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and take care that you do not touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, it is necessary that you smooth the remaining portion of bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or splinters remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen described, which is safer; and he praised it greatly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone where the broken place appears, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And do not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane that is below;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it gently, for it is removed well without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and the bone is cut only from above, and there are small pieces, then you must smooth that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
First use large rasps, and then finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle breaks, you must apply treatment according to its condition;
and this is something that is not readily known to one who has not applied himself to this art.
And if the synovial membrane is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled over two or three times, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the synovial membrane, then apply another bandage over it, and do not bind it tightly except so that it holds the wound only;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and bean flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and apply frequently cleansing medicines without biting.
and guard that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment there, nor let pus gather there, for when pus gathers on the brain’s membrane, it corrupts and rots it, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when one puts something biting on the synovial membrane, it becomes necrotic on top. Take heed then, if any bad accident befalls the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes there only because of the medicine that has been put on, which has such a property, then you must take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil and glue one cloth, and put it on the synovial membrane; then treat it with the appropriate treatments, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one by itself, for these are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, except by bending or twisting, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the nostril, and set the broken part against your index finger, and the little finger on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it with the end of a somewhat thick stick.
And if the fracture is in two parts, do likewise, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then put into the nostrils tents of linen cloths, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you place one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the nostrils.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a mixture of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is strong and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient blows through it; or do whatever you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or a little diachylon there.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, apply a plaster externally, of chickpea flour and incense powder, cooked with egg white, then put light lint on top, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and that solder, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead canulae in it, until it is healed.
When the jaw is broken underneath, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only external and is not broken in two, except perhaps inwardly, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently put the fracture back in place, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated into two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides, until they are even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, bind them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then apply cerate to the broken jaw, and apply a double cloth; and put on the cloth a well-made large star, or a piece of leather even, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and apply a plaster, of mill powder with egg white or bean flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and put light wool on the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses occur, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of the bone is removed; then carefully remove it with the instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew up the wound, if it is wide, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The fracture often breaks in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
or it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken fracture; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor displacement.
And if you need to extend further, then place under the patient's shoulder a round sphere of cloth, or of wool, and let it be large according to your need; and extend and lift the collarbone, and pull the sphere with your hand, so that you set the fracture, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the collarbone outwards, because it goes in deeply, then the patient must lie often on his back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the attendant pushes the shoulder down, until the bone of the collarbone is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must cut it open;
and draw out the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join because of some obstacle, then cut it with one of the scalpels that you have; but that you place this instrument under the collarbone, to protect the viscera:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and should be as wide as is necessary, according to the size of the bone and the power of the operation;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you have made when you have drawn out the bones;
and when you are certain of a hot abscess, cut the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with lint and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses appear, moisten a piece of lint in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cutting, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of ground powder and egg white, and place light tampons on top, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a handspan wide, then place a double layer of cloth over the tampons and the plaster; then take a thin strip three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the strip on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and tighten it on each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the strip does not move on the broken bone, then check it each day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will lighten the fracture of the collarbone by the elevation of the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is necessary, and tighten it and leave it so, until he is healed;
and it is healed at most in twenty-eight days, and in less time for some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It happens that the shoulder breaks either at the large part or in the middle, and one knows it only by the touch;
then set it according to the form of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can;
then put on the place powdered millstone with abundant egg white, and light tampons, and put on top a double cloth; then place on top a broad and thin splint, a little larger than the shoulder, and if underneath the splint the hair is tangled in any part of the shoulder, then fill that hair with linen tampons, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the binding each day;
and every time that it loosens, then bind it, and set the splint evenly if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number of days is complete, then unbind it, and be sure, for it is not a bone that easily dislocates.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and points below the heart, then incise and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to appease a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breastbone
The breastbone is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks at the end.
And when it is broken in the middle, it inclines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and immediately, and perhaps vomits blood, and the movement in the broken bone is apparent, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and a cushion is placed between his shoulders, then press the shoulders, and bring together the ribs of the two ribs with your hands, and subtly put it equally in all ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and tampons on top of a fine layer of salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it is necessary to untie it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hasten, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and address what has come there with methods of treatment;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only occurs in thick places near the back, and at the front, and they only break because they are slippery; and one feels it well on examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the rib fracture is inclined inwards, the patient feels very great pain and pricking, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and often vomits a great quantity of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have applied great skill to it.
And some say that one should administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outwards.
We do not do this, so that hot abscesses do not arise, if they have not already arisen. And if they have arisen, then we heal them.
And some say that one applies cupping glasses to the area, to strongly suck, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might draw superfluities to the area due to its weakness.
And some say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in hot oil, and place tents between the ribs to equally distribute the poultice around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with meat and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because of the bone that pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut into the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the viscera;
and then one must cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area in the meantime as is necessary for an abscess, and let the patient lie often on the side where it is, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if you see his hands softened and swollen and numb, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortal in several ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is taken.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, observe if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are there which are in the hands, and on his back there is flatulence and involuntary evacuation;
and when he is turned on his stomach, there is involuntary evacuation. And when he is turned onto his back and he wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortal. Therefore, do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the matter is less serious.
And the cure is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to it until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that side where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the cow", if you put your little finger of your left hand there, and set it even with the other side to your ability, then apply the plaster and the bandage on top, if you need it;
then pull it, and if there is a separated bone, cut above it and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, it is only a little lessening at the head; and it breaks lengthwise, and slopes inwards, and the patient feels pain at the site, and throbbing, and the broken part swells.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are on the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is in its natural form.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it slopes inwards, then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the setting of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then apply a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the binding is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses appear there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are calmed, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the side and the head of the arm, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight stick of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them up high, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place his broken arm on the stick, until it reaches the armpit, and have a curve of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy thing or let an assistant stretch it down;
then let the physician set the break evenly with his hands together, until the break returns as it should.
And the other method is that one suspends the patient on his bedding, and ties his hand to his neck, then instructs two assistants that one holds what is above the break with his hands, and the other holds underneath with a rope, and each stretches on his part.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then pull a rope from below the break, and above the break, and let each of the assistants stretch on his part.
And if the break is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must place a rope in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, under the break;
and also if the break is towards the elbow, then it is necessary to put a rope lightly, without effort, until the break is even on the place, and on the elbow;
then set the fracture as needed, and pull it, if no hot abscesses appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then do not pull it until seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then pull it, and the manner of pulling is that you put the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and put your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and put the cloth, and pull on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone might move, then use splints, and put on the fracture one splint wider and stronger than the others, and let there be one finger's breadth between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it extends beyond the fracture three finger breadths on each side;
then pull on the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less so as you move away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time that you reset the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave it to mature until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If so, adjust it, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, then do not untie it except after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder a cushion filled with wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then adjust it by the virtue of medicine, and give him the food that we have mentioned before, in such a way that the food is at first light; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be completely healed within forty days; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it should remain unbound for fifty days or two months.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile," of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the little finger;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile is broken alone, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended a little, and set even.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be pulled more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher up, so that the patient suffers no labor;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the part below his hand, or to a sling, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each one in its place, and if there is any separated that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the singular chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the restoration, hot abscesses occur, then glue a cloth of cerate made of rose oil and white wax, which is neither too hard nor too soft; and tie the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and put on a plaster of the mill's powder with plenty of egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and pull more on the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as it moves away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident occurs to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must irrigate the limb with warm water, until that itching is calmed;
and do not let the bound limb rest.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bone separated, and similar things, then redress it.
And take care that nourishment can reach the limb, for if it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it thus for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said occurs to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands on his neck, and let his neck be straight, and beware of movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the constitutions and complexions of the humors.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending happens many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, it is necessary that the patient sit cross-legged, and sit upright before him evenly;
then he puts his hand on the outstretched cloth, and the attendant stretches the broken bones, and aligns them evenly, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and the lint, if no abscesses form, then applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the belly of the hand, make a splint of cloths, and instruct the patient to bind it to his broken hand; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be soft leather, as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place one splint on top and another underneath on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight as necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and it will not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together in an I shape, whichever works, or you place a splint on top, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the treatment of a hot abscess, and help what comes of it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns front and back;
and the restoration is that one binds one bandage above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his bandage to his part equally;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the bandages be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And also if it is close to the knee, then let the bandage be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone straight with his two hands, until it is according to its natural form, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses form there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is made in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap around the fracture a doubled hard bandage in two or three layers, and let the excess remain, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come up above;
then turn the bandage up the leg and up the thigh, then put splints on the fracture, and place a splint on the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to make the constriction even, then begin to bind firmly three or four turns above the fracture; and the further up you go from the fracture, the less you constrict;
then take hold of the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and constrict it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, until neither an abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it occurs, then unbind it, and treat what appears, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to cut open the place, and pull it out forcefully; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is little breakage, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a crack, or a hole, and it happens with and without a wound, and this is well felt.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round equal to its sides, until it is assembled as much as one can;
then apply the plaster, and put a round splint there, if you need one, and bind it as is necessary, then observe all the instructions we have given for other fractures, such as a hot abscess and other similar things; then apply to each complication what is necessary, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called by right name "mustelz," and the other is called "foscile";
and the same fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns in every direction.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and it is clearly visible; and it turns downward.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
however, if the fracture is severe, and there are many pieces, the extension must be gentler and lighter; and ease it according to your skill.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap around it in two places a bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg cannot deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, which is of wood, and in which the leg is placed to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then treat it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, no fracture occurs, but at the bones of the foot, fracture sometimes occurs and at the toes also, and there is nothing but crushing in many cases.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overriding each other, then have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he were going to walk, and then immediately place your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board two finger-widths wide, then bind it to the foot tightly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board which I have mentioned, and bind it tightly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then place on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be resting on the head of the board over the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each complication as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, make her sit upright, then incline her to the back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the patient's vagina with cotton, and put in it as much as it will hold;
then stand the woman up, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump out, until it comes to the entrance of the vagina, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a chain to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow forcefully into the chain, until the bladder is inflated inside; in this way the fracture will be restored;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures close to that which one puts their study and practice into, and understands my book, are not hidden.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right path of restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's neck and put the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or however long it takes, and it will be healed quickly.
Of fracture with wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or the like, that he be healed immediately, so that the healings that we have mentioned attest to it.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same time, or that day, if hot abscesses do not arise.
And if hot abscesses arise, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are subsided, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad accidents.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not suitable for you to set it in place with your hands, then reset it with this instrument which is of iron, which is seven or eight inches long, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the surgeon that he have three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb in your work, and let it be sharp in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," therefore it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even one against the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot well grasp the bone, then it is necessary that you cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able;
then smooth what remains of the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
So do what is needed until it is in place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and properly if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerote or anything else where there is oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer bandages when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take great care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the bandages be softer and gentler than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that a bad accident may occur, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you must not put on bandages; but wrap around, instead of bandages, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but repeatedly produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore it is necessary that you probe the wound with a tent and remove all these detached pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula forms at the site, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it according to what is said in the previous chapter.
And when the bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder, and others similar in the large limbs, do not pull it out, for many times death results, but leave it until it festers;
by chance it will fall out after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many swellings come after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and the appearance of the limb is an ugly thing to see; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the bone is fresh: then administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocol, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound in lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and apply them to the wound in lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin another, until the inflammation is removed;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation is already converted to hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it off, and remove the apparent excess; or you scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is healed, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of a multitude of irrigations; or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because he has little blood in his body, so is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body tender, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws to it great nourishment, and often moisten it with warm water, until nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is visible, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, then they must be bathed with warm water, or softening herbs are cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and I make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take fat figs, and crush them with pigeon dung, and similar medicines that reduce the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by continuously and repeatedly rubbing with wet hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut down to the bone, with a fine, light scalpel; and put diligence and care into the treatment.
Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, wherefore it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reduced without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one resets it with difficulty;
therefore one should not move it when it is swollen: it often causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling of the abscess is subsided;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as its cure will come into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It happens that the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: or they are a little removed from their places, and softened a little; or they are entirely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and the saliva runs from the mouth that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in several ways.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a manner that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts his middle finger of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the jaw inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on two sides; and the other two fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the middle finger puts it even, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if it is the two jaws together, then bathe them with warm water and oil, until you soften them gently;
do not delay in the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are equally reduced, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head be supported between two cushions, so that he does not move it neither to the right nor to the left, nor does he strain to chew, but takes light food, until the pains are removed, and the jaws are healed;
and then he eats what he wants lightly, and does not exert himself to open his mouth when eating and drinking, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be set at once, and are not returned to their places, fever and accustomed swelling result, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and many times he who it happens to dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards the ribcage and breast, and it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply a plaster and bandage it, and hold it tight;
and the shoulder that is towards the ribs cannot be dislocated; except perhaps a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, reset it as we have said;
then apply a plaster and bandage it, and hold it tight, and instruct the patient to rest until healed;
and in the same way is the head of the shoulder reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
of which one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate backwards because of the shoulder, nor inwards because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in those it leaps out hastily;
in those who have enough flesh, it leaps out with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a blow or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary then that you examine it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lowered towards the armpit, and it shows a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit, when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly by touch;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the assistant raises the patient's hand upwards, then places his elbows under the armpit, and raises the joint forcefully upwards into place; and the assistant raises the hand and extends it upwards, then places it underneath; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and the assistant apply a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then the patient should be turned on his back, and a wool pad of even thickness, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the physician places his heel on the pad, and raises the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pulls the patient's hand;
and another assistant holds the patient's head so that it does not move down; that shoulder returns immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and that you have present a man who is larger than the patient; and let him stand straight opposite the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and raise the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let something heavy hang with him, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one sticks a long firebrand in the ground, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and should be neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but so that he has soft cloths above, and the patient is standing along the length of the wood;
then his hand should be forcefully extended downwards on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths to the head of the wood, so that the wood does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the length of the wood, and tie the shoulder to the wood, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of suitable width, and let the hands hang down, and let the body hang down on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever manner that may be, you must place under the armpit an even ball of wool, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around, then bind it tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to his neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And he must eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must administer cautery to three points, as it is set forth in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast and the nipples, or behind, is caused by impulsion and stretching of the hands, and one administers another cure;
and cure until it is healed.
And if after the healing comes stiffness in the limb, and slowness in movement, let the patient use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is broken, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before hot abscesses come there, for if hot abscesses came there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps cannot be entirely reset, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and sometimes death results.
And the restoration is, when it is such that one can reset it, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms are spread, and the hands of the viewer according to the length around, above and below, and put the joint to its bends together, or to the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and grasps from the root of the palm the length which is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a double long and wide cloth;
and when the surgeon feels the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint forcefully, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, renew the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you put on the joint a poultice of mutton fat, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then put the poultice back on, and then into the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moistened cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
it will return to its proper place.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it is necessary to return it to its place quickly, at the very moment that it is dislocated, before the place swells, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the resetting is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and you place it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, it is necessary that you look to see if it is well in place; then let the patient place the back of his hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, let the patient place the back of his hand on the table, and the physician place his hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is well. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters applied warm, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it in place after some days, let the joint remain twisted;
and it harms the patient nothing except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves are severed, or the arteries;
then there is no other remedy except to cauterize near the case, and perhaps nothing else helps.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster that we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or of the neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions leap forth without will, nor can he hold them, and often some limb is weakened, either the two thighs, or the two arms, or one.
And often the spine moves in four directions;
that which moves backward is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you consider if the gibbosity came from infancy: then there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from blows or similar things, the ancients gave methods of cure with great words, where there is not in all cases great profit;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have devised instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast in front, there is no device or healing;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which properly comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched on his face in one even place, and have a cushion beneath him, that he not be injured;
then stick one firebrand firmly in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie one rope across the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two firebrands;
and let them be firmly fixed, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press well, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that turns by hand. And it is that you insert two firebrands at the head of the patient at a distance of one arm's length, and towards the feet two others, and there should be between each firebrand, above and below, a palm's breadth of space in length;
and let there be in each firebrand one hole, where the lathe runs, and let the firebrands be firmly in the earth, so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands let there be one turning firebrand, on which the ropes turn, and let there be on two turning firebrands two small firebrands of a palm's length, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the rope which is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with all the rope, and the master sets the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, then apply a desiccant plaster with egg white, and then the lint, and then a splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the place of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy vertebra, then bind it with a rope, as we have said, and let the patient use subtle nourishment, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the last vertebra of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone which appears, wherefore one should not presume there: by chance it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder there comes forth only dislocations, not as in other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inwards and outwards, and forwards and backwards;
and more inwards than elsewhere, and little dislocated forwards and backwards.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the diseased knee is more open than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes outwards, is that these accidents are contrary to those above.
And the signs of that which happens in front, is that he straightens his leg according to its length; nevertheless, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make him walk, he cannot go forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of that which happens behind, is that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is below the ribs.
The treatment of this kind of dislocation is that you consider if the dislocation is old, and if it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure; and there is no need for presumption.
And in him whose dislocation is fresh, and this is of the four kinds of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance it will return, and needs no other cure.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a linen cloth tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a way that he puts his hands under his armpits, then binds him with a soft linen cloth above the thigh; and another holds the head of the linen;
and they extend up and down all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then it is necessary to apply a cure to its likeness.
When the dislocation is inward, you must place the patient on his sound side, then place the linen on the root of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin, then extend the linen upward toward the groin, and toward the collarbone;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards forcefully; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than others.
And if you cannot set it in this manner that we have described, then you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft linen above the two heels, and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be hung from the top of a beam, and let it be two arm-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately quickly.
And when the dislocation is outward, let the patient lie down, as we have said in the case of those with gibbosity, and tighten a linen bandage on the affected leg properly, and on the foot as well;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and another at the feet, then insert a firebrand between the patient's thighs in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around, so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant extend towards him, and let the physician put the dislocation back in place with his hand.
If it returns, that is good.
If not, place him on a table, and press him as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the physician put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, nor to lift it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and he should be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint at the table; and it will be perfect when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back against his face, and put his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg bend to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and let the patient not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and tense towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and gently put the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is good;
If not, repeat the process, for it will return;
and if it cannot return thus, make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly stick a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a rope, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the physician equally set the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, put the plaster and lint on, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves which are on the ankle behind, that the binding is not too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the binding loosens, tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses appear there, then you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without effort, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any of the knots of the back of the foot, then you must have the patient sit on a level place or on a perfectly straight table, and place your foot on what is visible of those joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing is visible there, then place a two-legged table under the sole of the foot, then bind it firmly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not patient and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of healing; and when you see hope, then immediately restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscesses come there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer things that soothe a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and guard yourself from entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this is worth more to you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and your body.
