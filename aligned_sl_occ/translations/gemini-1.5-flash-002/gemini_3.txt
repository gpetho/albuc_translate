O, sons, since I have completed for you this book, which is the culmination of the science of medicine,  through its completion, and through its expositions, and through its declarations, it seems to me that I should complete that for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation with the hand, that is, surgery.
Because the operation with the hand is almost entirely absent in our region and in our time, to the point that the science of it is greatly diminished, and its vestiges are lost; and there remains of it only some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which have been mostly altered and have fallen into errors and hesitations, so that their intentions are obscured and their power and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revitalize it with the ordering of this treatise, according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that it should come with the forms of cautery irons and other instruments of the work, with the addition of their explanation and preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled artisan with his hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which is lacking in Gaul, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs and their forms, and their connection and separation; and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number and distribution; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that in name it is much, but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy is not exempt from falling into error, by which men will die, as I have seen many, for some are trained in this science and practice it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries in the neck, so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who was advanced in years, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and a black eunuch came to him who had a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with cushions and splints with tight binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he unbound it according to his wishes, and then he bound it again, and then he left it for several days and commanded that we unbind the binding; and it remained thus until the thigh and foot were suppurated, and it came to ruin.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the binding, and tranquility was achieved and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated after a few days, until its malignancy was magnified by its master (or owner).
The reason is that because the burning cancer is pure melancholic humor, therefore it is not appropriate that it be touched with iron at all, but rather be in a limb which suffers so that it is completely stopped.
And therefore, son, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two parts: that is, in an operation which is associated with health, and in a work with which there is danger in the greatest dispositions.
And I have already explained this in every part of this book where operations occur in which there is error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to observe this and avoid that, so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with the protection of God, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and laudable success, and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and put away your instruments from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not overcome you: for it is more conducive to your glory, and higher in the world and behind your sanctities.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician".
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter deals with the head down to the feet, the forms of instruments and the tools of cautery, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of suction and perforation, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and its harms, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they disagree about it, and a little of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, whether with matter or without matter, except two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to that, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable in an illness which is due to heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry illness should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I say that he who says the contrary is wrong, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry illness that comes to the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, regarding this discourse, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that this should come upon someone who has already been exhausted and exercised in the chapter on cautery by prior practice, and who has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the span of time of those.
But in other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid illnesses, because all doctors have agreed on those, and are not in disagreement about the benefit of cautery in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness, is preferable to cautery with burning medicine, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the member which is cauterized, and does not harm another member joined to it, except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches to those members which are distant from it, and quickly brings to the member an illness of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, except to purge. And it is known to us by experiment and by long service of study in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this I am excused from the length of discourse. And if it were not that it is not fitting for my book to leave hidden from you this secret regarding fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, and its expulsion by which it expels illnesses, with philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be tedious to your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they consider springtime the best time.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by the accidental time is submerged in the benefit that is gained with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pains, or for necessary, strong, and urgent pains, which do not suffer delay because it is feared that those [pains] will bring harm, which is greater than the small harm incurred by the time [of year].
And this does not enter your minds, O sons, this is only esteemed by the vulgar people and foolish physicians, that is, that to that illness which is healed by cautery there is no remission at any time, and they posit this consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think, for cautery is only in the place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause from which the pains come.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its efficacy and virtue of its operation and greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that his illness will return at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in him, and that which has come to him in his acquisition in food and similar causes; unless the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a limb with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that that pain will not return to him, but this happens rarely.
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and this is a correct saying, not in the sense that they understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that benefits with medicine or any other cause besides cautery.
And the reason is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not work, and then at the end of the process one administers cautery, and it benefits in that case. And therefore it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and too many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the purity of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not scar, although that is not entirely true, for I have already proven this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies and not others, and cautery with it is good and better than with iron as they said; however, when you cauterize with fire with gold, it is not apparent to you, because it is consumed according to the amount you want because of the softness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply too much heat, the gold melts from the fire, and some laminae fall into the fire so that the artisan is distracted by that.
And for that reason, cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately for the correctness of the operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that I might offer to the inquirer that which he desires from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization combats the humidity and coldness on the brain; the accidents of which are two causes: that is, the cause of sudden and abundant rheumy flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and much sleepiness, and toothache and throat ache, and universally any illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sudden unconsciousness, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine, purifying the head, for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the patient, his age and his constitution.
And then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then make him sit between your hands on a low bench and have him place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the bridge of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that place, mark that spot with a probe, and then ignite the olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with the probe, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand is slowly constrained, and you rotate it.
And then lift your hand slightly and observe the area, and if you see some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, about the size of a grain of barley, then lift your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another if this one is cold, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and leave it for three days.
And then place on it lint soaked in wine and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And it is said that when the wound remains open, it better discharges the arm, for that is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the fistula should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's substance is burnt.
And then scrape away what is burnt from the bone, and then it should be cured.
And others say that with the cautery, penetrate to the back, until it penetrates strongly into the bone, until the bone is burnt, and this is the form of a small abscess: And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then let it be cured until it is healed.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a matter of fear; and leave that, for my part, better is health when it is; for the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, as we have testified in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a weak nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and I use and work with that one for health.
Chapter Two.
Concerning the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the whole head, and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches, and cuppings, and purgatives, and plasters, and poultices, and cauteries, and unguents, and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we recount and none of these things benefits him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and it is not weak and finds much great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery a little below that one. And then cauterize that above the horn of his head with a cautery until the scab is parted. Incise the scab and let the bone be uncovered to the extent we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the rear part of the head in the place which is called the vas—and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient thereby finds much great pain, different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I say this cautery in its place, because it is necessary that the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle place of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter Three.
On the cauterization of recent migraine.
When a sudden pain occurs in the head, or a spreading pain within the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the sections on diseases; and if all this does not help, then cauterization in this case is done in two ways: either cauterization with an acute burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it and cut off its extremities from both ends. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet, so that a place is made under the skin, so that it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress to cause constriction, and leave it for three hours; then unbind it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a cotton swab soaked in vinegar until the place becomes inflamed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner:  heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail or peg, because its head is like the shape of a clove, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Then place it over the area of pain, and hold your hand — so that the cauterizing agent below is not burned — and rotate the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount that is burned by the specified cauterization is only half of it, then lift your hand so that the artery underneath is not burned, so that a flow of blood does not come.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; then place cotton soaked in a poultice, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a knife according to the cautery method, and beware of cutting an artery in this specific, not-ancient, migraine.
Chapter four.
On the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat migraine with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes because of the illness, what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire is insufficient, then you must heat the knife cautery until it is white-hot, after marking the location of the pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or thereabouts; and pause your hand for a moment and press until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle not be injured and the nerve which moves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the guarding and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, for in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who ignores what he does and is not studious and experienced; and he abandons the operation at the beginning.
And I will come with a remembrance of the treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if sometimes this illness is not relieved by this cautery and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of an artery with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5. On the cauterization of earaches.
When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxatives and with the other treatments that I have mentioned in the section, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and it is that which is called "puncta," of which this is the form:
Then apply the point of the cautery, and let it be moved around the entire ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is located in a specific part. Slowly lengthen the cautery from the root of the ear, after you have marked the spot with a probe.
And if the cautery requires ten points in the whole ear, or whichever ear it may be, then treat those places until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only of the types which originate from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type of cough that arises from dryness or from spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of cough with enemas and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauterizations:  one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side from the affected part, because softening [or relief] only comes to the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the upper ear, a little above the temple, and another in the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the thumb, and hold your hand with the cautery until the quantity of half the thickness of a goose quill is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, the form of which is shown/depicted above. However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away some superfluous thickness.
And then take care of the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said and your medication is not effective and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize the patient with four cauteries: on each of the horns of his head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is already cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is further behind; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the cauterization of forgetfulness done by flame.
That large jars and purifying pills be given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and place on their neck a plaster of cetre described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cautery. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And therefore if he is healed by these means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauterizations in the back part of his head, which descend from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place between each cautery the width of a finger, and then treat the cautery with what has been prescribed.
But if you see increased swelling and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize in the middle of the affected area; and if you see even greater swelling, then cauterize on both sides.
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
As you proceed with the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on all the sides (corners) of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find it and the patient tolerates it and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is burned from the tailbone up, and raise your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive-oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And then it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and can tolerate the expulsion of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery in his occiput, and cauterize over each temple. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as has been previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries which we have mentioned in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division (of treatments).
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a decent-sized poultice for him on a circle (of cloth), and then place that in the middle of the head.
And let the patient sit upright, and be held on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is most worthy to use old sheep's fat. And heat that over the fire with a moderate, measured heating, which the said sufferer will feel when it is applied to him. Then pour that into the middle of his head within the circle, and leave it there until it is cooled.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his other treatment, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize it making small punctures according to the need of the patient, but hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in fat or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the beginning of water in the eye is revealed to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to purify his head, and protect it from all humidity.
And make him sweat in a bath for a few days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the beginning of the flow of water is in both eyes, or on one side if it is the beginning of the water in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the hairline; and let the cauteries be at that distance in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with any medicine which is possible for you.
And I come with knowledge which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed separately.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (likely referring to chronic sores or ulcers).
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest place of the head outside, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the beginning chapter of water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it needs addition (further treatment), then cauterize that in the whole area of the corner of the eye above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or, more accurately, a foul smell from the nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division (previous section) and your treatment does not help, then you prepare and give the patient decoctions (or potions) to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauteries above the two eyebrows, slightly below the hair.
And be careful with the cautery that you do not burn that (area).
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form/shape.
Chapter 15.
Of the cautery for the softening/mollification of the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize that (area) above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part, and they should be elongated/extended from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand with the cautery, but only so much that a third part of the eyelid is cauterized/burnt.
Chapter 16.
Concerning cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either with fire or with a burning medicine.
If you cauterize it with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave his eyelashes as one shaves them, until they are lengthened and aligned; and if it pricks from the root, then you bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that it is not injured until the hairs are grown.
Then, when they are grown and aligned, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with a probe, with a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in gum arabic on the eye.
And then heat the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the figure that you have marked, little by little, in several times, until the surface of the cornea, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burnt.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and its hairs raised above the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it like that for three days, and then place a pledget with salve on it until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the hairs near their root and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are below the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is healed, and the hairs do not touch the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; this is to order the patient to pluck the hairs until they are elongated and healed, and then a plaster of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf should be made.
Then take known soap and quicklime and unrefined olive oil, or whatever that is, and mix those ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; then spread this on the plaster which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place this over one or both eyes; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your seat (i.e., under your care/supervision).
And place your finger on the medicine and press it slightly and do not remove it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire to him.
And then, when you perceive that he feels the bite, then leave the medicine and remove it with your finger; then, when the bite ceases, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider if you see that the eyelid is already raised as it is lifted from constriction with fire or with incision, for then it is well; and if not, return with that medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet been applied and it does not darken until your operation is healed and the eye is contracted (i.e., healed and the eyelid is back in its normal position).
Then place cotton with a bandage on it until the scab from the cauterization is eradicated, and then treat it with healing ointment or with another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to guard with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after some days is softened and some of the hairs are drawn into the eye, then repeat your medicine on that part of the eyelid which is softened, and precisely as you did at the beginning, and then bandage it until it is healed.
And this is the form/method using myrtle leaves.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size (magnitude and smallness), and therefore your contraction (or treatment, referring to the bandage or adjustment) is made accordingly.
And the path of rectitude will not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
On the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have described in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have a minister hold their head between your hands in such a way that their head is not moved or shaken.
Then place a cotton swab dipped in egg white or gum arabic on their eye.
Then heat the cautery, which is shaped like this:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it penetrate to the other end. And if you wish, let it be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the rottenness from it.
Then place the cautery, which should be well ignited, upon it, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not waver or the patient be disturbed. Then, place the cautery on the granuloma of the eye and burn it away.
And so, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it thus for three days, and then apply a bandage over it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some earlier physicians described:  Identify the location of the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin tube which is the shape of it. And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand with a tube with good retention, and do not move the patient, so that the molten lead does not reach the eye of the patient; and it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a cloth soaked in egg white or water, because the lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it through a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal perforation and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Chapter 18. On the cauterization of the fissure of the well (likely referring to a wound or ulcer).
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the previous sections and your treatment is not effective, then apply a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that instrument in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
On the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula is formed, and you treat it and the treatment is not effective, then you should apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula. Then place that heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, holding it with your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it. Do this once or twice at the back of it; and then treat it with what we have said concerning treatment until it is healed.
And so if the wound is incised and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to open the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be explained in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
On the cauterization of teeth and the softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and they are not effective, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be appropriate for this, so that you place the small spatula against the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold your hand there briefly, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as needed.
And then let the patient rinse their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is now fixed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humidity is dried out.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or if there is cold or worms in it, and you cannot cure it with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with a hot iron, or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with a hot iron is done by taking a hot iron and heating it in a coal fire. Then take a cloth and wrap it around the end of the iron, and then dip it in the boiling iron, and quickly apply it to the painful tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cloth in the aforementioned hot iron, and place that on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is that you use a small tube of brass or iron, and there should be some thickness in its body so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired temperature, and apply it to the tooth, holding your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times, because the pain will be reduced either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, after the application of the cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good hot water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophuli (a likely reference to skin eruptions or lesions).
When extrophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them gently, then you ignite the cautery, whose shape is as follows: having two open ends so that smoke escapes from one end of the cautery and place the ignited end on the abscess once, and again if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cloth soaked in butter over it until what the fire has burned is softened.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On the cauterization of hoarseness and constriction of the throat.
When humidities gather in the lung's passage, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and afterwards cauterize the area below the root of the throat in the constricted place.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn his windpipe, but only a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the junction of the neck at the last vertebra. And his cautery should be a nail, following the previous method.
And afterwards treat it with what has been previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity, and the patient has no fever or consumption (tuberculosis) and the illness is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle, in the previously mentioned hollows and pits; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the previous method.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be punctate with the cautery that is called a punctate cautery, the form of which precedes in the punctation of earache.
And let there be points within those (cauterizations); and then treat it with what has been previously described until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs because cauterization is done with this: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the testicle, which is the head of the penis.
When the head of the penis is dislocated because of lubricous humors and is not fixed in the moment of its return from its dislocation until it is in the place it is accustomed to return to, and then with a small movement it is dislocated again as it has been observed, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation, and then let the patient be turned onto his back or onto his side; and then elevate the scrotum which is in the inner part of the testicle to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated in the inner parts.
And then ignite the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the scrotum until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized points.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place on the cauterized area cooked porridge with salt, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened, the humidity is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors come into the stomach, so that it is drawn from its proper composition and its multiplicity remains in it, and if you continue the methods of treatment and do not cure it, then it is necessary that the patient lie supine on his back, extend his hands and legs, and then cauterize that area with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, to the extent of one finger, with a pointed cautery, and with two cauteries below on both sides of the cautery, so that a triangular figure of cautery is formed; and space them out so that they are not touching, which would cause putrefaction.
And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the finger.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery according to the form of a circle according to this form:  (Note: This line implies the existence of accompanying diagrams showing the shapes of the cauteries.)
And let the stomach be cauterized, paying attention to what is feared from this cautery: and it is that you mark on the stomach points according to the quantity you desire with a probe, and then cauterize those points with a cautery; and then treat it with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, or humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is thrown from its normal fullness by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it doesn't help, then it is necessary that the patient be supine upon his neck, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same quantity upon the liver under the hypochondria, where the patient's lying down allows. (Again, this implies accompanying diagrams showing the placement and size of the cauteries.)
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight finger.
And do not compress too much with the cautery.
And if the quantity of what is burned is the amount of half the thickness of a finger, and no more is added; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already extended his thighs, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the thickness of a whole finger be burned so that the whole body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the finger here is subtle; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of an abscess of the liver with a cautery.
When an ulcer or abscess develops in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds gravity and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, with the pain there is great sharpness and sometimes it tires the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be positioned on their side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then ignite the cautery which resembles a rake, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the bottom, until healthy blood flows.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this type of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is long and in whose hands many illnesses have been known; but this one, with some experience, may sometimes be bold in this operation, yet let that remain to us, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy, according to this manner, is effective, and it is this: that you take of the long, dry roots of birthwort a root one finger long that is found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
Then submerge that in oil and hold it to the fire, and then cauterize with one cautery in that place which is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the chin, slightly inclined towards the part that is below the beard, and with two cauteries in that which is declining between the fifth rib and the sixth, declining slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another above the stomach, and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in that place which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you grasp your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in the evident part of the handle in operation.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray and ignite it, and put it in that place which is between the ribs, until we reach with it that abscess and it is purged of the sickness, just as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without danger, for one might easily kill the patient in the place, forming a fistula for which there is no cure.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have said of the treatment in the division and it does not improve, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are proper. One is to make three or four cauteries lengthwise according to the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauteries, the shape of which has been previously described.
And let the width between each cautery be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand on the cautery; and let the patient be lying on their side.
And another way to cauterize is to ignite the cautery using two points, the reason for which we have explained in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the caul that is in the area of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And let your elevation, with which you raise the caul, follow the length of the body, so that cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two ignited points into that space so that with them you penetrate the caul on the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
And then you must tend the cautery until it has ceased bleeding for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding procedures in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical patient.
Cauterization is not applied to all dropsical patients, but only to certain ones specifically.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery over the stomach, and with another cautery over the liver, and with another cautery over the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery over the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
And then leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not deprive the patient of treatment after cauterization with what is necessary, so that two intentions are combined in him, and he will be hastened to healing with assistance.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its form is described above.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the dorsum of the foot, between the little toe and the ring finger. Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand and do not completely return it, for the yellowish water will flow out.
The cautery is according to this form: Then make two cauterizations on the two thighs, and on each thigh a cauterization should be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water may drain from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is cold and damp, weakening its functions – that is, the digestive and retentive functions which are in the stomach and intestines – and is treated with methods of healing and fails to improve, and sometimes the patient suffers a cauterization exhibiting its effectiveness, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the stomach, as was previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin awl-shaped cautery; and with a cautery on the hypochondrium, on a large aloe, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it over the pubic region and over the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries near the stomach and near the groin, for this is a perfect and helpful cure, which you should not miss.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When there are in the lower part of the body chronic hemorrhoids, or those caused by thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and the cure fails, then cauterize with three cauteries over the most inferior part of the spine, small and triangular, and with a cautery above the navel, according to the two aforementioned methods.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is undigested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on the spleen using a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of a fistula near its excision.
When you excise a fistula, then you ignite the cautery that resembles a ray (or, a spoke). Then insert that ignited cautery into the excised fistula, and control your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the fistulas are many, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat them with that which you apply to them in ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on something, it is slower in healing.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the private parts.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the private parts, and it is old,  it is eating away at the flesh and is filled with corrupt humors. Then what is most appropriate is to probe it with a thin probe, and then ascertain the depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery which is similar to a ray (presumably meaning a pointed cautery). And then insert that ignited cautery into the fistula, according to the depth determined by the probe.
And repeat the cautery application until those corrupt tissues are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your needs.
And beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then beware of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it is not penetrating deeply.
And then care for the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter has been excised from it, and remains so for a long time, then know that it is entirely cured.
And if the matter has not been removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or the bone itself is corrupted, or it comes from those causes which will be recalled in their place (i.e., discussed later in the text).
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of sores.
When in sores pain arises from cold or great windiness, and because of this the patient's skin is damaged, then it is necessary that you cauterize that sore with a cautery on each sore, with the pointed cautery of which mention has previously been made.
And quickly cauterize again a little below, so that three linear cauteries will result, and then they will be more helpful in treatment.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that area in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the walnut; and cauterize that area with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped cautery, as is appropriate.
Chapter 39.
Concerning the cauterization of the breast.
When cold and dampness come to the breast, and therefore conception is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs with their arrival, then it is fitting that the area be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the area below the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
Concerning the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that the thigh is lengthened compared to the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it protrudes.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the affected part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the affected area as it is swollen, so that the affected area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind used previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be done according to the size of the thickness of the whole rib; and then care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is treated with what we have said and do not deviate, and this is ancient practice; then you should purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or with artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize that area.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
If according to the two known methods, one of which is to cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the place, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, so that it is a continuous circle and burns the thickness of the whole hip.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is adherent to the hip and is not extended to the thigh.
But if it is extended to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the patient points as the location of the pain; and with one cautery on the hip, four finger-widths below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-shaped, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the hip.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is extended to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery for three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not use the cautery so much that you burn nerves or cause great injury, and that because of this there is no bad consequence or contraction for the patient.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle and overdid it in the cauterization, and the leg became swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong case of diarrhea occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this manner.
And the wise ones say concerning the cauterization of the ankle, a cautery of which this is the manner: make a ring of iron, of which the circumference should be half a palm; and let its opening be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another, a third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a walnut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those irons be a walnut or two walnuts, and make in those irons a mark properly prepared in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the ankle, the patient lying on his side. And then cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave that for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: O, son, of this type of cautery we have used little, because of the fear of looking at it, and because we have found few who dare look upon it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with it the location of it.
But cauterize with adherent medicines so that you make two circles having a perforated armature in which you place the ring of the iron door; let the length of the walls in the height be two nuts or whatever those are.  (Note: This translation is difficult due to the archaic and possibly corrupt nature of the text. The meaning of "armula perforada" and the comparison to nuts is unclear).
And if the spaces which are between each are the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and let them be open below and above, and let them contain themselves between them according to this form: (Again, this is difficult due to ambiguity; the description of the spatial arrangement is unclear).
Then place the patient on their side with the affected part of the hip upwards, and compress your hand on the part of the hip; then take hot water and pour it between the two circles, and let the heat be applied slowly and gradually, and keep it there for about an hour, and let the patient endure the biting and burning of it — for this produces a burning sensation like fire — until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the hot water from the whole hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and apply a poultice to it until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for some days, and pus will drain from it; this is later aid/treatment.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the hip or leg, apply a bath to it containing water, in the same way as was done for the hip.
And this is the manner of hot water treatment, and I have already written about this in the treatise on the preparation/refinement of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, an equal part of each, and crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that needs to enter the rectum.
And place another inverted pot under the bottom of the pot, and pour over the alkali and quicklime fresh water which covers them by one finger's width, and then when you have compressed them with your hand with a good compression, allow the sharp water to descend from above into the inverted pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be of very strong acidity, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other members, because it works like fire.
And some medicines with which cauterization is also done, such as verdigris and honey mixed with quicklime and soap in such a way that they are mixed together.
And Galen recounted the operation and cure of a man of old times, by which sciatic nerve and hip pain was cured, and greatly praised its effectiveness, and said that no other cure was needed, and because it was healed at once as he recounted, because very quickly that man entered the bath and was already free from it.
And it is that fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh rue is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be very well crushed with a little grease and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, because the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But already Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it will benefit him very well; and the cautery should be done in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes and the ankle.
Then take dried goat dung and burn it until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of the cauterization reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called cautery of embers (or glowing coals).
Chapter 42.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth from various causes, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, by infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable in that single instance which is caused by an effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with suitable pills and similar remedies, make three lines on the tooth where the pain is, according to its width, applying a cautery mark to each line, or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and their constitution.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of gibbosity (or humpback).
Many times this illness befalls small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it happens to their structure in the wing (shoulder blade area) with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and the buttocks that it (the gibbosity) already begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that (area) with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three lines (meaning, two or three short cauterizations). And let the points be close together.
And then care for the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in swelling caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to call this gout properly.
And thus, if gout caused by cold is cured with a method of treatment and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that you cauterize that place for evacuation in the area of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that place on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that place and do not press too hard with your hand with the cautery beforehand; let it only be around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise into both knees, then apply the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called a hand-ache, then puncture in the area of the veins, thus as they twist, puncture in those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the area of the veins on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains reach the joints or muscles after some days, then cauterize them on every side of the affected area.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, pushing the intestines in front of the scrotum, and this is beginning to happen, then it is necessary that you order the patient to stop eating that day and that he use soothing remedies so that the tear of his abdomen subsides.
Then hold the patient between your hands on his back, and command him to hold his breath until the hernia or intestines are expelled or appear.
Then return that [the hernia/intestine] with your fingers and gently manipulate the rupture over the pubic bone, noting that the extremity of the rupture should resemble half a circle in the upper parts of the body.
Then ignite the cautery, whose form is this:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and let another servant be on his legs, and another on his feet, who will hold his hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach with it the bone of the hip joint in the middle of the thigh; and repeat this another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And observe carefully the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest death or other great harm come upon the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete/successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size and measure.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a poultice until the burn scar is healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not protrude due to the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about 40 days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another 40 days.
And let him be sparing of work and of abundant food and drink, and of loud voices, for when he uses this regimen of complete healing he will be healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the belly; and if, at the beginning, you want them to not protrude, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let what is excised from the hernia be about one-third of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is not adjusted. (The last phrase, "and it is not adjusted," is somewhat unclear and may refer to a previous instruction or a need for further adjustment of the treatment.)
And some earlier authorities said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion (or twisting/strangulation, likely referring to a strangulated hernia).
When pain develops in any limb due to a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cauterization of each limb be according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization on it; for it is customary for these pains to be punctuated from one limb to the one next to it, so it is necessary to treat those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
Therefore, if you wish to cauterize a leper, consider whether the leprosy is spreading and whether it has been treated with what we have said in the section, and whether it does not spread or remain, and we fear that the corruption will affect the whole of their body and their entire complexion, then cauterize them on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second lower down, toward the forehead at the hairline; and two on the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.
And lastly, with the cautery, press your hand slightly inwards so that it makes a small impression on the bone, and the crusts are dislodged from it, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is relieved from it; and cauterize over the spleen as necessary.
And if the leprosy is already widespread on the patient and manifestly apparent, then you should cauterize them with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the elbow, and one on the elbow, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the knees and one on each knee, and with two on the ankles, and with two on the muscles of the calves of their legs; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of their feet, and on the wrists of their hands.
And beware of the nerves which are on the heel, that you do not burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more precisely you apply the cauteries, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do from incisions, because their body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as prescribed by the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the cauterization of numbness/stupor.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin. And afterwards cure that with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes some numbness is cauterized which extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back near the origin of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except one who is skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of white patches which are morphea (vitiligo).
When the white patches are old and you do not apply any medicinal ointments, then cauterize it with a cautery iron a little, according to the size of the affected area, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and with arugula leaves, and with pigeon blood or with swallow blood, each in equal parts and all mixed together, and then apply a linen cloth over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When the cancer is beginning and you want to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its circumference as it is swollen.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with the pointed cautery iron in the middle; but to me this is not advisable, for I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have already seen this happen on several occasions.
And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle as we have said, or with several cauteries.
Chapter 50.  (Assuming a numbering system consistent with Roman numerals,  L = 50)
Concerning the cauterization of a boil/abscess. (The word "adubilati" seems to refer to a type of swelling or inflammation;  "boil" or "abscess" are likely modern equivalents).
When a boil/abscess is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or to the age of the patient, because he is old and decrepit, of little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the boil/abscess; then cauterize around it with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it alone, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the shape: and place it in the middle of the boil/abscess until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower down, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On cauterization with a corrosive.
A corrosive is a corruption moving in the limb, which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place which has suffered cauterization with fire, then you should ignite very small, hot nails, and large ones as appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and none of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place crushed sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on whatever remains in the corrupted areas.
And corrosion is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that is a substitute for cauterization. But however, cauterization with fire is of quicker help.
And I have already spoken of its treatment with sharp medicine in the section, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times, a disease called a wound occurs in the parts below the foot, and it is a large, penetrating wound which injures the foot; and cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, that is to say cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is to heat the concave cautery, similar to a vulture's beak, which is made of iron according to the size which contains the wound in its entirety, and is of fine edges.
And then place that heated iron on the wound, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed pus. And then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it is not healed, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with water to these areas.  Take a cannula of bronze or iron or vulture bone, and place it over the wound; then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand, and you move it with compression of your hand entirely, and press the edge of the cannula into the root of the wound, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the wound; and let the patient endure the bite of the hot water for a little while, for about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this to those [wounds] and then to the others until you have treated all those that are in the body.
And then treat those sores, once the roots of the wounds are eradicated, with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On the cauterization of tremor.
When someone suffers from tremor due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever of a cold origin, or from a similar cause, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor will subside, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
On the cauterization of accidental blemishes on the body.
When blemishes appear on the body, and they are pustules or fissures caused by thick, corrupt matter; then, at the beginning of their appearance, it is necessary that they be cauterized on the head of the fistula with a thin cautery, with myrtle wood, the end of which is ignited with fire; or with a long root of erestologia; or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes, a cautery is also applied at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; and they are not believed [to be effective], and the superfluity is disrupted by doing this, and heals from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done near evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of a blood flux accidental to an incision from an arrow.
Many times, there is a flux from an arrow wound that is incised near the wound, which comes from outside, or near the incision of abscesses or cauteries of the limb, and the like; and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand to the orifice of the arrow wound, and place your finger on it, tightly pressing it many times until the flow of blood is stopped under your finger, and it does not come out.
Then, put small and large olive-wood cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and the wound where the artery is broken,  on that vein quickly, after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until that blood is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove your finger and take away the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from among the cauteries that are prepared in the fire, and do not cease to do this one after another until the blood is restrained.
And be careful that you do not burn the nerve that is there, and that another injury does not befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to restrain that blood in those cases, and especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the extremities are better cauterized and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with thread or with a ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines be placed upon it whose virtue is to restrain blood; and they should be tightened with a cushion with decent constriction.
But that which administers decent restriction with a ligature and with constriction with cloths or by the application of cauterizing agents and similar things, does not work except slowly.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then open slowly with the index finger on the orifice of that vein as we have said, and attend to its strong constriction until the blood is stopped from the principal part of the wound, and the finger is not removed from the artery; and over the artery let it be sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and consider further what need there is of cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already stated in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire is suitable and with burning medicine, and the occasions and causes of it, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one seeking this may be helped, then on that which he will have asked.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is what is terrifying in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because it is necessary that there be great caution in it, for in the operation which is in this chapter, many times there happens an evacuation which is with blood with which life is sustained, through the opening of a vein or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or purification of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and their like. And with all of these are accompanied fear and trembling, and in most of them death happens.
And I admonish you that this, in which there is hesitation, does not befall you, for sometimes you will handle men with many kinds of illnesses. And of them there is some who are angry with their illness and death is light to them, and this because of the vehemence of what they find in their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And of those there is one who gives you his possessions and says, you hoping with that for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to that which comes to you from which is this handling; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your rapacity; and do not presume any cause about this except with certain knowledge which verifies this to you, and to which a praiseworthy outcome follows.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that is to you help towards acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and of glory.
O, sons, may God inspire you with his understanding and not hinder your guidance and protection, for that is in his hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that this which you ask for and of which you have need may be relieved for you.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth and when the nurse binds the child's head too tightly.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is not known.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it is in my view a deadly affliction for them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could not support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the skull and the bone, or it is collected under the bone on the brain.
For the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make a fissure in the middle of the head in width, and the length of the fissure should be about two finger-widths so that the moisture can run out, and this is the form of the spatula:
And therefore if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone, the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress that with your hand on the inside parts, and this is not hidden from you. It is necessary that you make a fissure in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the moisture from the incision; and then bind the fissures with cloths and soft feathers; and then wash it over with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appears, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore attend with the incision where the abscess and the repletion of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and that a flow of blood ensues and the patient dies from that flow of blood with evacuation of moisture.
Chapter Second (or Chapter Two).
When someone develops a catarrh or rheum in the eyes or nose, and this is chronic, and the cure is not achieved by medications, then the final cure in this case is incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise them, have the patient raise their head, and thoroughly rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and the patient's neck should be constricted with a cloth; and carefully observe where the vein pulsates; and the location of each [artery], since the locations near the ears are depressed, and are thus hidden in some people.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and incise each one with a sharp lancet, making an incision that reaches to the bone, and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' breadth, for when a vein is incised, the blood will flow out with a pulsatile emission, leaping forth with frequent spurts.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth, and mark it with a probe, and proceed to the bone.
And the quantity of blood to be let is about six ounces, and you should quickly let out more or less, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
Then examine the wound, and if any cause of infection remains on the bone, incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
Then bind the wound tightly with lint and linen bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrimonious humors and a quality in the tissues of the temples, or a similar vehement and chronic condition, and treatment with medicinal methods does not help, then in these illnesses we have proven the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization, as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair which is on the temples; and attend to the artery apparent in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden only in few men by the force of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with hot water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then put in it [the artery] a hook and extract it to the superior parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the hook, and then incise a part of it according to the quantity by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, for if they are not incised, the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords at length, and do not allow it to putrefy before the consolidation of the wound and the occurrence of blood flow.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of the same work.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or a hot complexion; for cautery is one of those things that helps to dry up humors, and therefore it is better in its application (or better for young people).
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you clean the place with old cotton, and that properly made powders are placed on it, and then it should be treated with dry medicines that cause the flesh to grow and with bandages until it is healed.
And if, while you are operating another time, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you must take care to restrain that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with cotton, and pressing your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those things are at hand, then place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and dab the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as needed.
And what is lighter in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each one, very hot, until they reach the bone and incise the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. But however, if there is less sharpness than two knives it is better, because if they are sharp like two knives close to each other, they will not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held in them and the flesh is cut lightly.
And this method is better in every respect and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
Chapter Four: On the treatment of sharp and acrid tears from the eyes.
When there are acrid tears, and it is the flow from those veins which are on the head, and you find no cause for it in any medicinal treatment, and you see the patient's face redden and feel in their forehead a crawling sensation as if it were the crawling of ants, and their eyes are swollen, wet, so that the hairs around them are matted, and the eyelids are inflamed by the sharpness of the tears, the ancients were skilled in treating these cases with this operation, and they called this treatment "spassa".
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then incise three fissures in the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure reaches two fingers: one fissure should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length, a little above, of the movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal duct, and the third on the other side.
And beware of incising the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers, adjust it.  (A more natural English phrasing might be: "And ensure that the space between each incision is about three finger-widths.")
And have ready a piece of sponge or dried cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/spatula] the whole chain which is between the two incisions, with the instrument which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision.  (Note:  "chain" here likely refers to a specific anatomical structure, possibly a vein or muscle group. "Ciphac" appears to be a surgical instrument.) And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [curette] against the flesh attached to the chain, and the blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that appearance of the chain, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place upon them powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day, untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the treatment of tears from cataracts and those descending into the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone suffers from sharp and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes appear small and sunken, and their gaze is weak, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their hair falls out, and there is sharp, persistent pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know by these symptoms that the matter and cataracts come from the inner parts of the head.
And the best cure in such cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be between the bones; and extend your hand from the temples, which are sore due to chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it above with powders soaked in wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then you should scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and make a plaster from them and apply it to these wounds to promote the growth of new flesh.
Chapter 6.
On the treatment of that which falls into the ears.
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either mineral stone or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass, or it is from a plant, such as a thistle or a bean, or it is a fluid substance such as water and sour wine and things similar to them, or some animal.
And so when a stone falls into the ear, or another similar substance from among those things which do not adhere to or grow in the ear, and you expose the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then proceed with its extraction, and induce sneezing with a suitable remedy, and block the nostrils to facilitate the occurrence of sneezing. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and gently pull the ear upwards, for often it is expelled by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then proceed with its extraction using the instrument called a delicate ear-scoop, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the scoop, good; and if not, then proceed with its extraction using a thin probe with a slight curve.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by this, then make a small tube of brass and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear and seal around the tube with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the tube. Then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times we have recounted this method.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of lit tinder or birdlime, prepared for catching birds, and place it on the end of a ray [presumably a thin, straight object], and then carefully wrap a suitable bandage around it. Then gently insert that into the opening of the ear, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods we have recounted, then you should consider cutting it out before it becomes a hot abscess or causes a spasm.
And the manner of cutting it out is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract the blood according to their strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear below its cartilage, in a well-prepared location. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until the stone is reached; and, once the stone is found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then quickly close the incision, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause lodged in the ear is one of the growths that grows and is inflamed, then administer its treatment and extraction; but if it does not yield to such treatment, then take finely ground bone according to this method: and use that to remove the growth that has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on small weights, and then extract it with tweezers or with a delicate instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thus eased.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing initially, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie on the ear into which the water has entered; and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take several smooth stones and pebbles, according to the length of the finger, and heat them slightly in the fire, and the patient inserts one of these into the opening of his ear and jumps on one foot on that side, and strikes with another stone upon the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or tow, and place one end of it in the ear and hold the other end to a fire until the greater part of it is burned.
And then put in more tow and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula, as has been said above of the stone extractor.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a louse or similar, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is large, which appears to the sense of sight, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its cause is the lightest of all other causes that fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment does not work, then you should expose the ear to the sun.
And so if any cause of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks, but if no cause appears, then take a cannula that is narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it with strong suction, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you fill and close the circumference of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And let it be such that it pushes what is in the cavity of the cannula continuously where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a ray (presumably a thin rod or instrument) and wrap its end decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula—and that is in the ear—and then insert the ray with cotton on top and press with your hand, with moderate compression, until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the hearing and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should already be slightly warmed by fire. And take care that the substance which you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the treatment of ear obstruction.
Sometimes children are born from their mothers' wombs without a perforated ear, and this also happens in some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or from flesh growing there; and this obstruction is sometimes in the pre-auricular area which does not allow hearing, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which happens in the pre-auricular area, which does not allow hearing, is in the greatest disposition of difficult healing.
And in that which allows hearing, it is necessary that you place the patient's ear in the sun and examine it. And then if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its extremity is small in width, one side being sharp and the other not; and let the spatula be two finger-widths wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And then if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or in its meatus, then take it with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the preauricular area (the area in front of the ear), then take a fine, thin rod and heat it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And then if you have felt an obstruction with which the patient experiences difficulty, due to the severity of hearing, remove the obstruction gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a linen cloth, according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take a wick and soak it in rosewater, and powder it with crushed sage and use it; and if you see that the ear is already festering, then you must remove the wick and replace it with another wick which you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the abscess is completely healed; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which occurs on the eyelids.
Styes which occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with fingers, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and then place a dry dressing on the affected area.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a thin, lentil-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains at their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there develops in the eyelids of the eyes some cause which is similar to a swelling in its strength and hardness, and because of this swelling it is called [a swelling].
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelid, below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling is proceeding in it in that which appears from the eyelid and is spread to every part; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on it with a lancet across its width, and then peel it away from every part with ease until it comes out, and then suspend it with hooks and cut it off.
And if the growth is large, then you adjust it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will befall you because of it, for the ointment heals it and it will granulate (heal by forming new tissue).
And if the growth is extending to the inner parts of the eyelid beneath the inner surface, then raise the eyelid and suspend the growth with hooks,  even if you need to make an incision, and press it from every side, and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this does not harm in any way.
And after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a growth on the upper eyelid.
A growth is a swelling which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and especially in children; it obscures their eyes and causes them much pain; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because of this, for tears gather in their eyes.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and their lower eyelids are damp beneath their eyebrows, which are already swollen, and the appearance of a growth is imminent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the growth beneath them.
And one method of operation is this: the patient places his head in your lap, and you place a cloth on him and make a compress for him, and make a circle according to the size which contains the whole growth, and then place it on the growth and press with your fingers all around so that the growth is gathered in the middle of the circle, and then make an incision in the middle of that swelling with a sharp instrument with a fissure, the fissure being no larger than the incision made in bloodletting.
But in the incision, it is necessary that you cut completely until you reach the growth, for in most cases the growth proceeds by fissure according to the form of a white swelling.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the outer edges and roll it between your right and left hand until it is removed.
And be careful not to press into the incision so that with the instrument you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the growth does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then press gently into the incision until the growth appears; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in warm wine and water and place them on the area and bind them with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it dries up the remaining humidity.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the ways of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, pustules are formed under the natural hairs and are hardened, then these harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membrane, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called a tactus (touching, infection) of the eye.  And it is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with an acute medicine as previously stated in the chapter on cautery; or the tactus is treated by incision and suture; or by cannulas, as I shall explain.
Therefore it is necessary that you place the patient's head on your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, introduce a needle into that part where there is pus under the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the pus upwards, and this should be— near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow— near the hairs, and draw the pus to the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it with the ray (presumably a surgical instrument or a light source).
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the hardened pustules with a lancet from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct; and then extract the pus and place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then bind over the eyelid with a bandage, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies in people, because in some it is necessary that a large amount be incised from the eyelid, according to the amount by which the eyelid is softened.
Then make an incision with the lancet along the two lines which you have marked, beginning from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller lacrimal duct. And if your incision is close to the natural hairs,  as thick as a king's (presumably referring to the thickness of a king's hair, implying a specific size).
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the wen, and then excise it completely, and then approximate the two lips with a suture of fine wool or silk, and wipe away the blood, and attach what overflows from the wound to the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture in place for three or four days, and then care for it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its granulation; but a suture is better. Therefore, the ancients advised this method of treatment.
However, let there be diligence on the part of the surgeon, and it is a good operation, and let there be no fear in him.
And there is another method of treatment, which is to mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separated and gathered hooks according to this form:
But if it is not possible to use hooks, and this is not suitable, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers equally, and with these, raising your hand with even elevation, raise the whole area upon which it is marked as we have described.
Then, join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess develops near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then you should use what we have said about incision; but suture in each case is more skillful.
Bandaging with canes is according to this form: and it is that you should turn back the eyelid and incise the figure that is within, as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two thin canes or splints whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and whose width should be less than the width of the eyelid. And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully add each [cane] with subtlety over that which supersedes from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the canes to each part with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days, for the hair, by the constriction, will die and be choked off and will rot until it falls out by itself.
But if it is delayed, then remove it with tweezers, and then cure the wound until it is healed.
Then, when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12.  Of the elevation of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is stiff.
When unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs are in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle and place on it a fine silk thread, and then you carefully adjust its ends, and tie each one in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm.
And then you attach two other fine threads below it briefly, and tie their ends if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, which requires skill, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair upwards and insert it into a [healing] solution, and let the hairs be one or two or three, and no more.
And then pull your hand with it until the hair is pulled out with the [healing] solution in the eyelid, along with the natural hair.
But if the [healing] solution is pulled out and the hair is not removed, you will pull the [healing] solution toward the lower parts with the bile that you have mixed with it, until the [healing] solution is pulled out of the upper opening.
And observe that with the sight of the eye, for then you will remove the [healing] solution and the bile, and gently close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or you let it be until it is lengthened to some extent, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a stye appears on the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound, incision, or cautery, and it is called lagophthalmos (leporina), and this contraction is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of a wound, incision, or cautery, or by something similar poorly treated.
The method of operation is that you incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not fitting that you use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do this, the stye will return worse than it was before.
Use in this case things that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply it with water in which mallow and linseed have been boiled, or with unguent diaquilum, which should be liquefied with some oil, and soak the cloth in it, and treat it with this.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you prevent it from consolidating in a way different from its initial form, by any means necessary.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing but a rectification of the stye so that it does not return to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a stye which is formed on the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms on the lower eyelid—which is truly called a stye—has some natural causes, others accidental.
But an accidental stye is caused by a wound, or a cut, or cautery, or other similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the affected flesh.
Then stretch the flesh at the upper parts with the needle and sew it up with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula. And if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that is good; but if not, take a splint and place it in the split, and with it reshape the eyelid, and sew the two fissures in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures be the two angles of the incision, which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be formed between them, so that when they are joined, a proper shape is made of them.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda (Λ).
Then remove the flesh from that side to the extent that the sharp lower eyelid is, so that it becomes the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts and sew them with woolen thread; and then treat them with what we have mentioned of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it has been excised by fissure, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid as previously described. Then separate [the wound] with a poultice between two lips as we have said.
In summary, concerning the treatment of an excision whether above or below, let the operation proceed according to the preparation of the excision, and this is in the form of many variations.
And the skilled surgeon always prepares the instruments in every possible way so that he may restore the form to its natural shape, or close to it, and that [he prepares] the patient according to what is suitable for him in terms of the operation and instruments in the best conditions.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men such that the upper eyelid is solidified with the white of the eye, and its natural movement and function are impeded, then you must insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and elevate it, or extend it with a probe.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed for incisions, but rather somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision gently scrape away that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distill into it some honey dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small linen cloth, and place wool infused with egg white on the eye, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is according to two manners, for it is either nervous, and is similar to a hard, subtle sheath; or it is non-nervous, similar to a congealed white humidity, which when the iron touches it, or it is forced to be taken with forceps, is cut off and the forceps are not fixed into it.
And both types begin only from the major tear duct until it goes little by little to cover the vision and prohibits light and the movement of the eye.
But the manner of working in its incision is that the patient places his head on your lap, and then open his eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with small, double-pronged forceps and extend it to the upper parts. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or double the tip of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which obscures the pupil. And thus you pull it with the hair towards the back of it.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that continuous flow of tears does not result from the incision of it.
And sometimes the nail, with the forceps alone, extended as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is the form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, after the incision, put a little crushed salt or a powder made from henbane into the eye, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it fixed with forceps, then very often this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the section.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the patient's eye and take a thin lion spatula of sharpened iron according to this form: with subtlety.  (or: delicately; skillfully) And if you see that it is rarefied and congested and rooted there, then distill into the eye your own juice, or henbane juice, or rue juice, or crushed salt, and plug the eye until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all that is in it is removed, unless conversely a hot abscess forms in the eye, for then you leave it alone and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it reasonably until it is healed.
The eminence of the lachrymal flesh, if it is noticed in the eye as a great impediment, should be suspended with hooks; and incise it on one side, and do not extend the incision lest you cut the tear ducts.
And then instill into the lachrymal duct rue juice and henbane juice until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of a staphyloma and of that which is born of fleshy matter in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is born and grows until it covers the pupil, or approaches and presses on the eyelids, and strongly compresses the eyelids on the outside parts, and is similar to the rose of a balustrade.
But the operation is that the patient places his head on your lap; and then open the eyes of that person and collect all that flesh with scissors convenient for that purpose, and hold it with forceps or with tweezers; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until it is all finished with the lancet, and be careful of the eye lest you injure it during your operation.
And let your incision with which you incise those things be with a spatula, which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which hair is collected, according to how the form of it will come about in this chapter.
Then when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it a red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a cotton compress over the outside of the eye with egg white until it is assured of a hot abscess.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and hot blood is seen, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat that abscess with what heals that abscess, and then return to it with an operation until it is healed, and similarly do in the adjacent flesh which affects the eye of this kind.
But however, you must avoid all treatment of the injured eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the member is enduring that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is caused by thick veins which are hardened over the eye and prevent the sight of its operation, and they weaken the eye over a long period of days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and if there is no other illness in it besides pus; then you collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head on your lap, and then suspend those veins with one or two ounces, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of a subtle duplication according to this form:
or two ounces gradually in one body according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with subtle forces, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins be removed from the eye and be resolved.
And be careful that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation that you do not incise except those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill into the eye verdigris or rue so that with its sharpness it corrodes what is removed from the eyelid.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with that which soothes his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is soothed and he is assured of a hot abscess.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
On the reduction of nasal dislocations.
When you treat a nasal dislocation with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as described previously, and it is not healed, then there is no benefit in it, but rather incise the abscess before its maturation, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
And thus, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round, like a chisel, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle incision (as is shown in the following form).
And place that [rasp] on the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and styptic substances.
Then, if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown there, and the body of the pus is separated and remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident befalls it, then you will know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is nothing else to do but to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: that is, you uncover the underlying bone with an iron instrument or a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a trephine in this form:
Let the tip of the iron trephine be triangular, and let its shaft be thin and tapered to the tip, like this [presumably a diagram was present in the original text].
And then place that [trephine] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient will feel this because they will feel air escaping when you hold your hand.
Then restore the area with styptic and drying medicines, as has been taught to you.
Then, when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter that was flowing to the external parts returns to the nose, therefore this is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and there is no accompanying injury, impairment or decrease in vision, then you should leave the patient alone, and carefully observe him, and apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suck by good suction; and then place on the eye an ointment which is made of honey and aloe and incense and sarcocolla, and then firmly apply the plaster to the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make of these many powders [or, make many layers/plies].
And then place those one on top of the other according to the amount that the eye needs. And then bind those tightly with a strong cloth with firm pressure; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it should be bound very tightly.
And then remove the bandage day and night, as we have said.
And if you see the eye has already been reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the eminence of the uvea.  (Note:  "uvea" here refers to the uvea of the eye.)
When there is a rupture in the uvea, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and its shape is altered, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted: you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below to above, and then place another needle with double thread on the side of the tear duct, and make it penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then incise the area with the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten it strongly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white and allow the thread to remain with the uvea.
And then treat the eye with something that will comfort it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth around the eye a large prominent area, and then it should be pierced with a thin spatula that reaches to the pupil of the eye, and drains the albuminous moisture, and the eye descends and enters immediately.
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of alconati (likely a type of injury or ailment,  requiring further context for a precise translation).
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a swelling that is situated in the eye, similar to descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and gently manipulate it until you see the swelling descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried so that it does not descend, and the light should be obstructed, and the patient should see things as he used to see them.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water (referring to the fluid-like nature of the swelling).
But if the descent of the swelling is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a thin spatula and use it on the pannicle (eyelids?), carefully around the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea at the limbus (in the empty space), until the swelling is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then let it be treated with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the watery discharge from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of watery eye discharge in the division and which ones are appropriate to puncture, as we have clearly stated. Then, this treatment should be done according to the patient's health.
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands on a square cushion and bind his healthy eye tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his eye, if the eye with the watery discharge is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
And then place the tip of the almond near the cornea, along the width of the iris in the white of the eye, on the side of the lacrimal duct, and then gently press the almond and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space (presumably a cyst or similar).
And it should be that the distance of the almond to the preon (likely referring to a point near the pupil) is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness (iris), and that is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with that pupil, with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the almond into the place where the water (presumably fluid buildup) is, and then you draw it down one time, then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then show the patient this on which his sight immediately improves, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you remove it another time before the almond is thrown away.
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond easily, and gently rotate it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and with that wash the inside of the eye; and then place on the outside of the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white, and with this the eye will heal.
But we and those of our time place on that (the eye) a compress of egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness — for there are some men whose eyes are very hard — then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is named alberid, of which this is the form:
Then perforate that conjunctiva with that (instrument), and do not force your hand into the hole, but only make a subtle passage for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, let a sleeping place be prepared for the patient, decently made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and let all movement be prohibited.
And place him in such a position that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain in place according to its disposition until the third day.
And then unbind it in that dark room and expose the injured area to the light, and show him some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Afterwards, it is necessary that you avoid this, because the water might easily escape due to great and vehement movement.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you unbind the wound before the seventh day, and treat it with what will reduce the abscess.
Then you will cover his injured area and place on his face a poultice by which his vision will be controlled, keeping him for some days in the darkest room.
And then let that matter be thrown away carefully and the cause investigated.
And know that in a cataract, the pupil is not excused from some visions, and then you should be bold in the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artaix, and some say that fire is made in Ayrac, a perforated vessel from which the water is sucked.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read of it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is novel.
And these are the forms of the species of vessels so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And let them be made of bronze or iron properly, and let their extremities be of this triangulated subtlety, the pointed extremity thus as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of rotten flesh in the nose.
When in the nose various fleshy growths are born, of which some cause is similar to a very small scorpion, or a polyp fish; and this illness is called polypus because it resembles that fish in appearance. And from it is cancerous flesh, flabby, of a dark color; and from it is what is lion flesh, not of dark color.
Therefore, in that which is in these fleshy growths, neither cancerous nor fraudulent, you must make the patient sit between your hands and place [him] in the sun, and open his nostrils, and prick your ointment into those growths. Then extract that to the outside parts, and then incise what you have grasped of those with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; that if any cause remains from which excision is possible, then you scrape that with one of the fine instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it bleeds profusely or a hot abscess forms, then you apply to it what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you cauterize and cut that until the bleeding is stopped and all the cavities are removed.
Then let there be poured into the nose near the incision, strong wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and humidity proceeds from it into the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the humidity does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is rotten flesh in the upper bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce a thin thread into it, to which some weight is attached, and tie knots in the thread, and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and then carefully insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe or with any other instrument that is possible for you to use.
And after you have done this, let it draw its odor until it reaches the canals of the nose, and is expelled over their throat, for many times children do something similar in schools, and it is an easy action for anyone who wants to do it.
And then tie the two ends of the thread, one end emerging from the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then apply sawdust mixed with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
And then remove the thread, and apply to the nose, near the extraction of the blood, a warm poultice, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that is rotten flesh.
And finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a more drying treatment, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purger, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or bronze, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purging instrument should be flat and open; to which there should be a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water, or whatever you want, of the juices and extractable substances.
Chapter 25.
Of the boils that appear at the extremities of the nose.
Many times a boil appears at the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in a few days, to the point that its appearance is very noticeable.
And for that reason it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. And then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in the place of it.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened, firm, dark in color and with little sensation; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; because many times he who incises this abscess suffers great harm from it, whoever it was that had it.
And if the abscess is of a light color and not dark, and you see that incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the area with what is appropriate and constricting until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Chapter 26. Of the suturing of the nose and of the lips and of the ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or the like.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should not attempt that operation except in certain cases.
Therefore, when such a thing happens to someone, consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you should join the two edges of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then you must scrape away some part of their apparent skin until blood appears. Then join the two edges with sutures and tighten them, and over that sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed embers, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the stitches are themselves cut away, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the abdomen, or you close the solution of continuity with thread as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things which enter the two lips in the inner parts.
Often there appear in the inner parts of the lips of many men certain hard abscesses resembling birdlime, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you open the lips and slits around each of those hardnesses on all sides, and then, after the excision, fill the place with crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and then it should be washed with sharp wine and the place treated with something styptic until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the incision of the flesh grown in the gums.
Very often a fleshy growth appears on the gums which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you lift that with forceps or hold it with forceps and incise it down to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
And then place crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders on the area.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for after cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inside and out, and between the gums, rough, decayed, and sometimes blackened crusts are attached, and they become yellowish or greenish, so that the gum is affected by this corruption and the teeth become decayed.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and rest their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those crusts and similar substances appear, resembling sand, until nothing remains of them. And do this to remove the blackness, the yellowness, and the others, until they are cleansed.
Then, if this which is at the beginning of the treatment has been removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those teeth on the following day and the second and the third until you achieve the desired result.
And know that the teeth require many tools of diverse forms and shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the tool with which the tooth is scraped from the inside is different from the tool with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms, and these forms of tools should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
So that you treat the tooth's pain with all skill and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that replaces its sight when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, for which its extraction is an exception.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is diseased, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and aching tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is diseased, and you know it well, then you must scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then loosen it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, at first little by little until it is completely loose.
And then apply strong, large forceps for a good grip or firm hold, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold him well so that he does not move, and then pull the tooth straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not removed, take one of those instruments, and place it under it on all sides with ease and force its removal in the same way as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or eroded, then you must fill that crack with cloth and bind it tightly with a thin strip of linen so that it is not broken at the time of your traction on it with forceps.
And you must carefully open with scarification around all parts of the gum and take great care not to break it and leave a piece behind, and return to the patient due to the harm that might be greater than the first pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity in extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are more difficult to cure, and their roots remain, all or some of them, or that you extract them with some bones of the jaw, as we have testified many times.
And then, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with hot wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding occurs from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of sage and sprinkle it on the wound, and if the sage does not work, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and the fine tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should have a long extremity, a short and thick handle, so that they do not bend when you work with them.
And let them be like tongs with a thick handle, so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent, [and] let the extremities be short.
And let them be made of Indian iron, precisely made with straight extremities, and at the extremities of these let there be teeth, of which some interlock with others and tighten by strong constriction, and sometimes the extremities of these are in the shape of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the extraction of teeth and the removal of bones from fractured jaws.
When you must extract a tooth that is fractured and some part remains, then you must place a cotton compress soaked with a poultice on the area for one or two days until the area is softened; and then insert pliers or forceps, the extremities of which are shaped like the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Let their extremities be made inside like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you in this way with these forceps or pliers, then you must dig around the root and remove all the flesh and insert the instrument which is called an *atali*, that is, a small lever, the form of which is this:
And let it be of short extremity, somewhat thick, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is extracted, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular extremity, which should have some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it be triangular and of a more subtle extremity.
And now be aided by this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the following form: and with other instruments which are used in tooth extraction; for the work is easily done with this instrument which resembles a large hook, and this is its form:
of a triangular, curved or short extremity, which should have some thickness, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
And also know that the instruments for molar teeth are similar to the other instruments.
But the wise and skillful artisan, finds for himself, according to what the operation and the various diseases indicate to him; for there are diseases for which the ancients neither named nor devised a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it can be, then it should be treated in its place with what is suitable for it from among the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with a splint, of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely expelled; and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude, not following their natural course, and this is especially the case for women, and particularly for venerable old women; then you must consider: if a tooth is next to another tooth, and filing or smoothing is not possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with this instrument, of which this is the form; and it resembles a boar's tusk, and it should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are damaged.
And if the protruding tooth can be filed, then file it with an Indian iron file of which this is the form:
And let the whole thing be of Indian iron and very fine; and let it have very small points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days easily, so that no other tooth is damaged and broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some rasps.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated it with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then so that they do not fall out, contrive that they be bound with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and almost powders after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of binding is that you take the wire and pass double the length between two healthy teeth, and then let it curve with two turns of the wire between the damaged ones, whether one or several, until the wire reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began, and tighten it gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you secure the wire, be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and carefully place those ends in each location, and cover them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened, remaining as it is.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner throughout its/their time.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the arrangement of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, as you sometimes see these bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to the alignment of each in their places, and are regrown as we have recounted, and that they are remade/repaired.
And only a good and skilled craftsman does this.
And sometimes some material from cow bones is used, and it is shaped like a tooth, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is fastened as we have said, and it remains and serves with that for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which is found under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation on him is that you open the patient's mouth, his head being in your lap; and raise his tongue, and then incise that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its restriction.
But if in that [area] there is any hardness or knot, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you insert an instrument and incise it across its width until you have incised the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the depth of the flesh and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
Then wash the site of the incision with warm water or with vinegar or with cold water; and then place under the tongue a linen cloth; that is, a small cloth which the patient keeps under the tongue every night so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes, an abscess resembling a small tumor occurs under the tongue, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no pain in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancerous.
And if it is tending towards white, and moist, then you put an oncia (ounce, or possibly a specific surgical instrument) there, and incise it with a fine scalpel, and cut it completely; and if blood flows during your operation, then you place crushed vitriol on it until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with sour wine and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the extraction of an abscess from the two ears and that which is located in the throat and other abscesses.
When a goiter develops in the throat, these are glands that are collected together, which protrude outwards and are called two ears; when you treat them with what we have said in the section and it is not healed, then you consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and insensitive; then do not touch it with iron (i.e., a surgical instrument).
And if it is red and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then you will either extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is one that should be incised.
And the operation on it is that you consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already matured completely through rest or if it has diminished in any way; and then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should be in your lap, and open his mouth, and the servant, holding it between his hands, presses down the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or bronze, and let it be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with this and the abscess is shown to you, and you look carefully at it, then take tweezers and put them in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can. Furthermore, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Furthermore, if you pull out something from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner, and immediately after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two [near] the ears, and incise those as I have said in the incision of the two sides equally.
And I myself once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat, which abscess was tending towards a dark color, with little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and drink, and she was near to death if she had remained for a day or two more.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had formed two openings through which it could escape.
Therefore I treated it with a fistula [incision] and inserted an instrument into one of the openings, and drew it out, and a large portion was removed; then I incised the other opening, and opened its mouth, and compressed its tongue, and then I inserted the instrument into that abscess.
And then I cut away a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore the throat of that woman was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she ate food; therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times for a long time, and another abscess succeeded in place of that one, which I incised until it was completely eliminated.
Then I took hold of it and cauterized her throat; then I stopped. And afterwards I walked around and did not know what God would do about it then.
Chapter 37.
On the incision of a wen when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and is long, then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not succeed, and you see that the cauterized abscess has already been removed and is thin, then you must incise that which is round and gathered; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and there is no feeling to it, then you must attempt its incision, for in that case there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit and press their tongue with an instrument which follows its form and then place the hook into the uvula, and draw it down and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of the tonsils.
And you must not incise it except what is appropriate to the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more, you will injure their speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by its incision, you should use ingenuity in its cauterization without fear, and the manner of cauterizing it is only with sharp water, and that you place the patient's head on your lap, and then press their tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take of the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with that living coal, and place it neither thick nor thin, and with this fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the shape:
Let its extremity be a concavity in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that the saliva or mucus runs from their mouth because of the caustic medicine, so that nothing descends from it onto their throat and harms them.
And then take your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a sheath so that the cotton adheres to that sheath, and do this as many times as necessary until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it so that it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and clean with that what is around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat it externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this kind of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cautery or incision, for it is cured by fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and mix all those ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sour wine, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with a suitable lid, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which a concave brass instrument is placed in this manner; it may be made of silver or brass.
And insert the end into the patient's mouth so that the vapor can reach the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the development of an abscess, for it would increase the abscess too much, and you should not do this, but rather cauterize the abscess when it is apparent.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a cane and attach an eggshell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is covered, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and that which adheres to the throat and other causes.
Many times something adheres to the throat, whether a fish bone or some other cause.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which is apparent, upon which your sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument in front of the light, so that that which is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, tie it firmly with thread, and then let the patient swallow it, for when it arrives at the place where the thorns are, it will extract them and they will be expelled. And moreover, take an eel, well tied with thread, and let it be inserted and quickly withdrawn; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly remove it.
But if they are not expelled by those means which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a small root, and at its extremity let there be a concavity which you introduce into his throat with ease.
And let him have his head raised up, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, so that it may happen to him that he hurts himself, and with that he may dislocate the bone or spine, or that the physician do this with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself introduce it, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached cause and pushes downwards, and pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not work, then consider putting it in the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with gentle, appropriate movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this repeatedly (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat), and abstain from giving the patient any water that day.
And then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it and keep stirring the water a little at a time with your hand, because the leech, as soon as it feels the water, falls off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cyme (possibly meaning a type of herb or incense) or with asafoetida, using the instrument which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of this is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then let the fumigation come from above; and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall off.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that by this regime it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps like this, except that there is some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughness of a file, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many types, according to what remembrance of them is seen, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is by the species of abscesses themselves; and by that which we understand of the humors.
And the second way is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, there are some abscesses which should not be perforated except near the maturation of the pus in them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be opened when they are raw and not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until that which is in its circumference can be purged, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore a cause of contraction of that limb is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the buttock, therefore perforate it when unmatured; and it is not fitting that you perforate it raw, of uncompleted digestion, except that which is near the buttock, so that its matter may not spread and be elongated to the inner parts of the buttock, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in such a way that it is not healed. Moreover, you must know the time for the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and a cessation of the fever, and also a decrease in the redness and pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know the perforation should fall in the lowest place of the abscess and from the coming cure of the eminence.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the places of the tendons, of the cords of the nerves, of the arteries; and, finally, in all even places in which there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you delay its perforation until its digestion is confirmed according to what has been said; for if you perforate it before that, the pus is prolonged and much filth remains, and its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body due to necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation or many incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And there are other abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be curved and incised, when it is made like bread and is ripe, as happens in cases of boils and buboes.
And some of these are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are administered, and similar to those.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you should perforate it with a superficial, or only flat, perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should perforate it and not worry about removing all the pus at once; having removed a part of it, then bandage the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and do this many times gradually until it is all removed.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, because the vital spirit is often dissolved with the egress of pus, and the patient dies very quickly, and you open them.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you should cleanse the wounds and consider whether the wound of the abscess is small, or if it is a flat incision; then you should apply lint or old linen to it; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you should place a tent in each opening until they join together.
And if in the abscess a part of the skin is cut away or you have hollowed it out around the edges, then you should fill it with old linen or lint made from linen cloth, just as when you have drawn out splinters or roots, without moisture; and bandage it tightly until the third day; and then continue with this and treat it with the ointments that are necessary until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you have soaked a linen cloth, and apply this to the bleeding area many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer the regimen and treatment and powders which I have described in many places in this book and in its divisions.
But if it is winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply them to the area.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders mixed with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and cleanse it and administer to its treatment what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction, I have already spoken of every abscess and in what manner is the way of its treatment in particular chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses are found, a type of node containing tunics which are attached to their surfaces; and their types are many.
And among them are some that contain a humidity similar to slime. And among them are those that contain a humidity resembling dust, similar to them; and among them are those that are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of those does not cause contrary effects.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is appropriate for this, which is called an *entromes* (a type of probe), until you know what they contain.
For if what it contains is humidity, then you incise it with a cut along its length, a superficial incision according to this shape:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you scrape that skin which contained the humidity, and do not leave any of it at all, because much that is evacuated returns if some of it remains.
And then immerse cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it there until the next day, for with this you corrode all that remains of that pellicle (thin skin).
And then repeat on that cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if it is needed, until you are confident that there is no remainder of that pellicle; then cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you incise it according to this form: with an incision having the form of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from all parts, and exert your strength in the extraction of the tunic which contains it.
But if the arrow causes resistance, then do what I told you first.
And similarly, treat a lapified abscess with incision and cure as we have told you; and the incision on a lapified abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little humidity.
And sometimes some of these abscesses are in the head of some men, in which there is no humidity at all; the reason is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head other than this, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses that appear on the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those from the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lowest parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for their cure.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42. Of the incision of scrofulas which happen in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they happen in other parts of the body.
And those which happen in the neck, and many which are generated among them, and every scrofula of these is within its own proper tunic, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, for some of them are stony, and some of them contain humidity, and some of them are malignant which do not obey cure.
Therefore, in that which you see of good disposition to the touch, of which the color that is manifest is near to the color of the flesh, and is softened in every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it behooves you to incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body of the line G. within the line B., and scrape it from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is most cautious that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the instrument not be very sharp, so that it not hurt you with the incision, or that it trouble the patient, and that you incise only what is necessary to incise; for if you should incise a vein or artery and be hindered in your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to be putrefied. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then investigate with your index finger if there is any cause of the other small scrofula; then incise those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then you must not incise that scrofula at its root. Afterwards, it is necessary to tie it with strong doubled thread and to leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then care for it.
And if you incise the whole scrofula, then you must adjust the two lips of the wound and stitch it immediately as soon as no superfluity remains.
But if you see that superfluity remains because of the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you understand how to incise its root, and extract it, and administer suture and what has been said.
And that of the scrofulas which contains humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place the perforation so that it is the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the core of the abscess accidentally occurring within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the core, and no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the description/writing of the speech/discourse of those (ancients).
But in men having a rupture (hernia), the extraction of the core should be avoided, because no benefit is done thereby, since all the veins and the major ones of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the windpipe, it is necessary to use the incision of the core to avoid the harm which is caused by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the core below three circles of the circles of the core, or four, with a small incision in width in that which is between two circles in quantity, so that the incision is in the skin, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant.
And if the physician is timid/fearful, then he should extend the throat's membrane with a hook, and then split the membrane until he reaches the canal, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
And then incise the skin as we have recommended; and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the inflammation which comes from it, by that which is ruptured from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time has arrived in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's membrane, and sew it only without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the sum of the discourse which we have recounted, the explanation is only that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the gullet of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient breathes over the site of the wound for some respiration, and is saved from death.
And for this reason I order to leave the wound open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I order to sew the wound, and cure it until it is healed.
And this which I have seen myself, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the lung's tube, and I was called to her cure, and I found the mucus as it is coughed up by the dying, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come out of the small wound.
Then I was confessed that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the wind came out of the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in her voice, and after some days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the dissection of the epileptic there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Chapter 44. Of the incision concerning an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess called throat hernia is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is according to two manners, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural one is not something to be cured.
And the accidental one is of two kinds, of which one is similar to fatty nodes, and the other kind is similar to an abscess which is caused by inflammation of an artery, and in that there is danger. And it is not fitting to apply iron to it except in the case of one that is small. And you probe it and investigate it with a probe, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you incise it as you would nodes, and extract it with what contains it from the skin and bursicle; and if not, then its entire nature is examined, and then treat the area with what is necessary for treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division (of chapters/sections).
And it is necessary that I recount here the difference between a node and an abscess, lest there be doubt.
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling of the superfluity is sedated; and putrefaction is complete, at which point the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that certain humor which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made like a blister, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for either they are greasy and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division (of chapters/sections).
Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the cure of a node, that you expel that and inquire about that at the beginning with an instrument which is called an intromes, according to what its form will become in the chapter which is near this one.
And the manner of inquiry into abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will revolve your fingers with that little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the pus.
And then extend your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess, and then extract the intromes and consider that which has come out in its track.
And if the running humidity, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you incise it with a superficial section as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if from the track of the intromes you find no humidity, then know that it is fatty (or thick/dense).
And dry it up with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form: Thus as has been taught to you, and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from all sides easily, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that matter with the node (or swelling).
But if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that matter, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until no cause remains there.
For if any cause, little or much, remains there, the swelling will return according to the measure (or degree).
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and tighten the wound, and place over it a hot poultice, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large swelling, then you sew the two lips of it and treat it with that which causes it to granulate (heal by forming new tissue).
But if a pulsating vein is against it, or a non-pulsating one, then you consider and fill the place with crushed alum, which is vitriol, and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incise what is rotten of the swelling.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of the instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and they are of three types: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, or of al-fulud (possibly referring to a type of metal or alloy), with appropriately squared ends, so that they easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called *albered*, and one of them is called *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form:
The form of the medium instrument, its form:
The form of the small instrument, its form:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses and discharges and fistulas and buboes, because among those there are [those] from the bones and from other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of latten, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of latten.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are suitable for opening fistulas in the cavities of which there are reflections, so that they may be reflected with their lightness to those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Form of the large lead instrument:
Form of the medium lead instrument:
Form of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are curved hooks, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of those there are [hooks] having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and there are three types, for of those there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way, except that it is done carefully in the scraping of the nodes to avoid the cutting of a vein or nerve, and by these means the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility through the cauterization which he receives during the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the forms of the cauteries, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of bronze and resemble a ray, with which alcohol is made.  (Note:  The connection between the bronze cautery and alcohol production is unclear and may be a mistranslation or a reference to a specific process unknown today.)
And it is at the pointed end, hidden with a spatula, and in that way it runs to the inner and outer parts when you wish, just as you see.
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses and the patient does not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those (instruments):
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is stopped, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you can stop the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and when other medicine is not initially effective.
However, do not use these to stop blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, and in the muscles of the arms, and of the breasts, and of the abdomen, and of the knees, and similar fleshy, moist muscles.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to the peels of chickpeas, according to this form; by means of which blood is stopped when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or by an arrow wound.
And sometimes they are made round according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Of the treatment of the breasts of men which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to excessive sleep, and then the breasts become inflamed and resemble the breasts of women, and remain as festering, white sores.
And for one who has this, it is necessary to incise it with a lunar incision according to this form, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medication, and then join the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast sags downwards and is softened by its size, as it happens in women, then let it be split in its two upper parts, with two incisions similar to a lunar shape, each one contained within the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from line B and line G. And then scrape the skin which is between the two edges of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer that which we have said of the suture and the powders, which is necessary in the cure until it is healed.
And if you cannot complete the incision of what needs to be incised because of the patient's discomfort, and because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses that appear below the nipple.
These abscesses that appear below the nipple are a type of scrofula, hard, and containing a sac-like skin.
And some of these contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised with a lunate incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it there until the next day.
Then the cotton should be removed and it should be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofula, then you should incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula above.
But if the wound is so extensive that it causes putrefaction, then apply cautery as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from an arrow wound or from a vein.
When an arrow is broken, and the remaining portion embedded in the wound is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs.  The signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or vein are these: for when the abscess is from an arrow, it is long and extends deeply into the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a sort of grating sound within it.
And that which is from a vein is round and superficial on the body.
And incision of this abscess is harmful, especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very great, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided as well.
But concerning that which is there from the inflammation of the arrow wound opening, make a lengthwise incision in the remaining portion of the arrow; and then widen the incision with forceps and around the arrow, and free it from the tissues until it is uncovered.
And then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the arrow with double thread in two places — which procedure I have shown you in the extraction of two arrows which were in the temples.
And then puncture the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment in which powder is applied until the ligaments fall away; and then treat that with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a severed vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can with the remainder, and then insert the needle below the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread on it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with good ligature as I have told you in the ligation of a grape, in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert the thread with that needle under the whole abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten the your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when that which is in it has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the remainder, and leave that which is bound to it.
And then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which happens through the twisting of nerves.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are struck or injured by excessive work, and similarly.
And it is formed most in the places of the joints or of the heel, or in any place where the joints are weakened.
And the abscess is serious, and is similar in color to the other body parts, and it is in the worst dispositions of them and when it is tightly constricted with vehemence, the patient feels a similar numbness.
And the abscess is not located in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the ribs, and it is weakened in every part and does not extend to the front or back parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be incised with iron, for contraction will quickly follow.
But that which is in the head or forehead, incise it with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and excise it by the roots.
And if it is large, then you should suspend it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the groin, which happens to the belly.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies that there are swellings which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and the lips of these are turned inward, and some are small, and some are very large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two swellings which were very similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with slender roots.
And the lips of these were inverted and split open, and humidity constantly flowed from them.
Therefore I incised them and found in one eighteen ounces of pus, and in the other six ounces.
And the operation in their incision is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the swelling is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be present in the fire, because many times after the section much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind the swelling with it, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead thread strongly until it is cut off and falls by itself without labor.
But if the swelling has a thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a swelling which is of a dark color, of little feeling, and of a bad appearance, for that is an abscess of cancer.
And I come to the remembrance of cancer with this.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of a swelling of the umbilicus (navel).
A swelling of the umbilicus is caused by many things; either by fissures of the diaphragm which is above the belly, and from it the membrane or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery, as has been said before; or by wind constricted there.
But if it is due to a fissure of the diaphragm and protrusion of the membrane, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is as we have recounted, with even more significant variation, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and returns; and very quickly it is there again, and is greatly increased by the entry of a bath and strenuous work.
But if it is due to humidity (fluid), then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to raw flesh (a wound), then the abscess is severe, large and hard, and is located according to a certain amount (or quantity/size).
But if it is due to flatulence (wind), then its touch is soft.
And the operation in it is that you consider then if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or due to flatulence; then it is necessary that you are prohibited from the treatment of it, because in that there is fear and danger as I have taught you in the chapter in which I have described abscesses from arteries and veins.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or the membrane (peritoneum/hernia sac), then it is necessary that you command the patient to hold their breath and be lying down extended; and then mark with a probe around the whole umbilicus, and then command him to lie between your hands on his back, and then surround with a wide bandage around the umbilicus over the place which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the abscess upwards with a large inch; and then bind around it with strong thread or with a bandage and in a decent manner of binding.
And then open the middle of the extended abscess over the ligature and introduce your finger into that space and seek the intestine; and if you have found it and held it by the ligature, then you pull gently and push the intestine back into the inside of the abdomen.
And if you have found the membrane (hernia sac), then grasp it with forceps; and incise its superfluous parts.
But if it is close to an artery or vein, then surround that area carefully, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and thread strong thread into them and insert the two needles into the circumference which you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate; and then tighten the abscess into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place so that the extended flesh may suppurate and fall away of its own accord; or incise it when it is thinned and suppurates, and then treat it with whatever ointments are necessary until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is swollen with flesh or by humidity, then it is necessary that you open the abscess as we have said and draw out the blood or the humidity which you find there, and then treat it with what is necessary and which will consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken, in the division, of the types of cancer and in what manner it is possible to treat it with medicines, and that it is advisable to avoid treating it with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have discussed cancer and the caution and care of its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and similarly located members, to extract it all, especially when it is small and beginning.
But when it is old and large, one should not attempt to treat it oneself, for I have neither been able to cure anyone of it nor have I seen anyone else who has succeeded in this.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you should proceed and purge the patient and remove some black bile at times, and then bleed them if a manifest plethora is found.
And then prepare the patient with a preparation in which the location for the operation is situated, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then scrape it thoroughly with a sharp curette until no part of its roots remain. And let the blood flow, and do not stanch it lightly, and press the areas, and wipe away the thick blood entirely with your hand or with any instrument which is available to you.
But if you find an excessive flow of thick blood from an incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or the species of anasarca, because that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is not effective, then consider this: if the patient has already developed weakness, or suffers from another illness alongside this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain, and similar conditions, then beware of treating them with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see a patient with exuberant strength, and with no other illness but dropsy alone, and neither a child nor an old person, then the method of operating is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the assistant gently presses their abdomen with his hand, driving the water towards the area below the pubic bone, and then take a sharp, pointed instrument in this manner:
Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a lancet; however, let there be some shortness in it, little by little, so that in operating with it you do not penetrate the intestine and wound it.
And then consider if the origin of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you, with the incision, move away from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, in a straight line above the pubic bone.
But if the origin of the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wants to lie, lest the superfluities run to that fragile place.
And then perforate the entire sheath with the instrument, and then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the sheath and the peritoneum, and you should scrape that; and if it is the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then perforate the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or latten, which at its lowest part has a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its incised extremity is shaped like a feather, like this:
And at its uppermost extremity is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately settles on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a moderate amount, because if you evacuate more than is necessary at that time, the patient will quickly die from the dissolution of their animal spirit, or a syncope occurs which is close to death.
But evacuate according to the quantity of its virtue and according to what the patient's disposition signifies to you, the virtue of their pulse and their well-being.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason for which is that it is immediately retained by the chain which retains the hole that is on the cup, of which I have told you that you should perforate it in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure with the instrument on another day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and beware of error so that only a little water remains.
But if you are afraid for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
Concerning the treatment of children born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the head of its penis is not perforated (or the opening is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using a very fine instrument, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead pin in the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when he wants to urinate, let him be helped and he will urinate; and then remove the pin.
And if you do not place the lead pin, it is possible that the urine, which flows over the area, will not allow it to close.
But the one whose opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But in those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, the cause is that the opening is at the end of the penis, so that he cannot urinate unless he lifts his penis upwards with his hand; and he is infertile, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line, and this is a very long-lasting illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a firm pull, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, like a feather incision, or that you shave a small part, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis and the opening falls in the middle as needed.
And be careful in your operation of the flow of blood, for this often happens; and stop the bleeding with what you have, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of the whitlow which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis, and of the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis.
Many times this whitlow occurs on the penis and is a swelling of foul flesh.
And of these, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine thread and excise it until you have completely cleaned it; then apply to that wound an ointment soaked in Egyptian ointment; and after that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a dark color, then you should apply cautery around the incision and its root.
But if the whitlow is in the prepuce of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the whitlow is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the whitlow which is inside first until it is healed; and then you treat the one outside, because when you treat both at the same time the prepuce is at risk of being damaged.
And if you find in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should remove all that which is already blackened and which is beginning to corrupt or is already corrupted; and then apply to it a mixture of honey, pounded with the rind of a pomegranate and crushed and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with another [appropriate] treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
because cautery is helpful in two conditions at once, that is to say, to a flow of blood and to a wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert into the meatus of the prepuce a lead cannula so that the patient urinates through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on him; and when adhesion happens due to a wound or an abscess), it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these delicately, then you should scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and of the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when it is thin, is very easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a very thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with styptic wine until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is done primarily on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not discuss circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience.  The reason is that I have found most surgeons and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with forceps; and they use ligature with thread and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with forceps, with ligature with thread, than cleansing with the nail, because many times the skin peels back from above, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision and sure pain. And with cleansing which is done with an awl, and is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not safe, because it easily enters the hole.
But in the operation with a nail, it easily becomes rusty and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of the child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with forceps and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience has shown me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, because the sharpness that is above is the same as the sharpness that is below; and thus as you press your hand, there are two proportional sharpnesses, and it cuts according to a comparison at one time; and compression is made of the thread with a shape containing the foreskin of the penis from every part, with which no error happens at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stand, especially if it is one of those that understands a little, that you do nothing but tie the thread to its penis only, and let it be until the next day.
And then do what you can to encourage it in whatever way that it can understand. And then hold the child steadily between your hands, and let it not be restless; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
And then place your hand on his penis and blow into the foreskin, and pull it until the head of the penis is exposed, and then clean it of whatever dirt is accumulated there.
The shape of the forceps for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let one end be non-cutting and the other cutting, so that the nail's shaft is not exposed, and let the length of the two pointed ends be equal to the length of two handles of equal size.
But the error in circumcision is that you too quickly remove the entire inner foreskin, or a part of it, from below the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch that [skin] with your fingernail before the suppuration of the area and that you incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with forceps and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the suppurated area, then you should leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and then carefully incise it and cut it as you see fit.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for this will harm him.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure from the scrotum and reaches the parts above, this will not harm him.
And furthermore, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh, and similar to those things we mentioned concerning the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and the cause is vehement in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form:  Let it be of silver and be a slender, concave tube, like a bird's quill, with the subtlety of a long ray, about a palm and a half in length, which has a narrow tube at its tip.
And the manner of drawing out the urine with this is that you take a doubled bladder and tie wool or cotton at its end with a good binding; and introduce the ends of the bladder into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if there is any excess wool, but introduce it into the cannula forcefully. Then anoint the syringe with butter and with egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and rub their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rosewater.
Then gently insert the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient will feel that it has reached the void; and this is not done in a straight line, but the passage goes in a tortuous way.
Then gradually extend the bladder with the wool, because the urine will wet the wool.
Then remove it and treat the urine, and use a syringe; do not cease doing this and using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the method of clysterizing the bladder with a catheter and similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood is present in it, or putrefaction is constricted there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a catheter, and this is its form:
except that its extremity is blunt, that is, closed. And in that [extremity] are three holes: two on one side, thus it is made.
In the beginning, it is concave, in which is what is pushed in, and it should be according to the quantity that fills that [cavity], without addition, until when any matter is drawn from the humors with it, it is drawn out; and when it is expelled, with that [the instrument] it is drawn, and when expelled long, as is done by a catheter with which naphtha is poured into the ships in sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to draw out humors from the bladder, introduce the extremity of the catheter into the humor, and draw with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then introduce the extremity of the catheter into the urethra as we have described in the syringe; and then push the humor with what you push, because that humor comes to the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The form of the fine catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the upper end should resemble a small feather, and below it a smooth, narrow tube.
And then take a goatskin bladder, and place in it the humor you wish to instill into the bladder, and then tie it tightly between two ends with strong double thread, and warm that humor over the fire.
And then introduce the end of the catheter into the penis (urethra).
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid, pressing gently, until the patient says that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is tightly bound; and then attach the circle in such a way that it is well sealed, after you place in it what you want of the humors, and oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with that as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and their symptoms.
And we have discussed the stone in which the operation is done by hand and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that stones generated in the bladder mostly affect children; and among its symptoms is that the urine that comes from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his genitals, and often cries, and is restless; and with this, pus comes out of the anus in many of them.
And the healing of children from this is easier until they reach fourteen years; and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young people it is easier because of this, since it is among them.  (meaning: it's easier to cure in young people because the condition is common among them.)
And of that (disease) in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we cleanse the patient with a clyster, which removes all the filth that is in his bowels; for this filth sometimes prevents the expulsion of the stone through its search.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet up and shaken and rubbed gently so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it jumps from its place sometimes.
Then make that small incision between your hands, prepared, and his hands should be under his thighs so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
And then search for it and all that is outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the area, then immediately attend to it with an incision.
. And therefore, push the stone until it rests under your finger. And return it little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And then press on that with your finger, and expel it outwards, away from the place where you made the incision.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with her hand; and instruct another assistant to extend the genitals upwards with her right hand, and with her other hand to support the perineum which is below the genitals, near the location of the incision.
And then insert a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: and cut what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size that allows the removal of the stone, and no larger, because easily you can compress with your finger which is in the anus, the stone against the incision, and it is expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and rough, which makes their removal difficult because of that.
And of those, that which resembles a gland, and is round, is easily removed.
Therefore, if it is one that is angular and rough, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not expelled in this way, then you must push on it, or press on it with a suitably shaped instrument, the tip of which is like a file with which you press against the stone, and it does not escape; or introduce under it a thin instrument with a curved tip.
But if you cannot reach it, then you enlarge the opening a little, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then initially you apply your hand to the opening of the bladder, and then incise it; and then gently push it; and similarly do if there are many more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to incise it with a large incision, for two things may happen to the patient: either he dies or he suffers from continuous urinary incontinence, because the wound is not completely healed.
But administer its expulsion until it is expelled, or work on breaking it up with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood powder, and bind it tightly. And place over that a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be calmed.
Then lay the patient on his back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you have untied it, wash the area with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there appears a hot, burnt, and corrosive abscess, and it resembles blood frozen in the bladder, and because of it urine is prevented (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction therein.
Then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with any other suitable remedy, doing what is appropriate for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all the treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and the flow of urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I have recommended before you resort to incision, because many times because of this treatment incision is required; and I have proved this, and it is that you take a polished iron perforator, of which this is the form:
of triangular, sharp, pointed end, fixed in wood.
And then take bile, and bind the penis with it below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches the stone. And revolve the perforator with your hand on that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
And then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, because that is fragmented, and it is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you due to some reason that prohibits it, then bind one bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then incise upon the stone in that penis between the two ligatures. And then extract it. And then untie the bandages and cleanse the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bandage below the stone except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other bandage above only because when the bandage is untied near the extraction of the stone, the urine returns to its place and heals the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the bandage above, that you elevate the urine to the upper parts, or that it return to its proper place, and the wound heals as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone is found in one of them, then its cure is difficult, and is prohibited in many ways.
One reason is that women are very easily made virgins (implying the difficulty of procedures due to the hymen).
And the second is that you will not find a chaste woman, or a married woman, who willingly reveals herself to the physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who is well-skilled in this art, especially the operation by hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for a stone in women is far from the location of the stone itself, wherefore a deep incision is needed, and in that there is danger.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must obtain a female physician who is skilled, and few such are to be found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a cautious and subtle physician, or present a matron well-versed in the matters of women, or a woman who knows some part of this art.
Therefore, present that woman, and command her to do all that you instruct, from the initial examination for the stone; which means that she should determine if the woman is a virgin, then she should insert her finger into her anus and seek the stone.
Then, if she finds it, let her grasp it with her finger, and then command her to incise over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the vulva of the patient and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with a good compression.
Then, if she finds it, she should gently pull it from the opening of the bladder downwards with the sum of her strength until it reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise upon it near the midpoint of the vulva below the root of the thing, wherever it is stopped, and center the stone in that area, and her finger should not be removed from the stone while grasping it.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and then introduce the instrument into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size that she knows the stone will be removed from it.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore you should know how many types there are of it so that you may indicate what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And make sure you prepare the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then place powder on the area and compress it with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will very quickly die. And then take care of the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the area has healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white scrotum, which is below the genitals, containing the testicle, and is called scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the proper pouch which nature prepared for the testicle, so that it is believed that it is another testicle; and it is the cord of the genital between the white scrotum which we have mentioned, and this is only a swelling.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or it is black and foul-smelling, or it is a watery white, and this is the most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white scrotum which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, slightly elongated, like the shape of an egg, and it surrounds the testicle, for the moisture contains it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper pouch, then the swelling is round near the testicle and therefore it is believed to be another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the root of the genitals and the white scrotum, then it falls below the feeling/sensation.
And when you want to know the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the swelling with a probe, from which the shape is determined; and according to what comes out on the probe, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its cure with iron (cautery), then it is necessary that we order the patient to be phlebotomized if that is possible for you, and see his body full (of blood).
Then let him be supine on his back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths under him.
And then sit on his left side, and command the assistant to stand on his right, who should extend his rod (probe or similar instrument) on one of the two sides, to the root of the genitals and the region of the navel.
And then take a broad spatula and split the perineum in the middle lengthwise almost to the anus.
And let the incision be made straight and equally distant from the line where you should separate the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white fatty tissue (included/comprehended).
And scrape that [fatty tissue], and observe, and be careful not to cut it; and your scraping, with which you scrape it, should be suspended [gentle] and subtly investigated with the scraping according to the quantity possible for you.
And then perforate the water-filled cyst with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the cyst to the parts above; and do not touch the perineum, and incise the cyst in the way that is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not meticulously investigate its incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the egg [testicle] protrudes from its sheath during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the cyst, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the perineum with suture, and then cure it as you would other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the spermatic cord, and remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two parts together, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that part in the same way as you did the other; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then you perform it.
And then you wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the perineum and the area of the abdomen; and place on top folded cloths and powders, and bind these on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then let two cloths be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and let the ends be made with which it is bound of cotton or damp wool, and let them be fastened with a tight binding in the waistband of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the buttocks to the front, and the second reach to the part of the groin, and two ends over two cushions below and two other ends over two knees, and the whole binding should be tightened in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the perineum, and it is heated as we have recounted until the white pus containing the fluid is discovered, and then you take a cautery according to this form: and it resembles the Greek letter.
And then pierce with that cautery, and it is heated until all the moisture is expelled.
And then extend the abscess with an unguent, and scrape with a thin, heated cautery; and incise it as much as possible until you eradicate it all; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg (presumably referring to the testicle).
And know that this operation is safer and involves less blood loss, and better than operation with incision.
But if an abscess hinders you during the incision or cauterization, or blood flow, then you must treat whatever is hindering you, with the treatment that is appropriate to it, as has been described.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I have recommended; and that is when you are certain, from what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some elevated seat, then perforate the abscess in its lowest part with a wide spatula, and position the perforation according to the length of the body (likely referring to the length of the abscess).
And let the opening be wide enough so that all the water flows out.
And then place a bandage on the area and tie it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is an obstruction to the drainage of the water, then you should perforate it: and this is done only because the white pannicle in the opening of the wound creates an obstruction and prevents the outflow of water; then you must put into the wound a probe or instrument with which the water is drawn out from dropsies, the form of which has been described previously; or apply gentle pressure to the wound.
And know that if the water returns and is collected again within six months or thereabouts; and when it is collected, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus pass their days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is a fear of loss leading to death in the most favorable circumstances; therefore, in my view, its removal and saving by other means is better.
And I am recalling the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the genitals which are composed of these things and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, acrid superfluity which is poured into the genitals, or by percussion (a blow).
And the color of the abscess follows the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a stony abscess formed, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by an inflammation of them such that it is perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means upon compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision should be made upon this type [of abscess] and on the other flesh; and it is that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then extend the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament, and tie it, and incise the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from every part of the parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the sheath, or between that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of a hernia that is of the scrotum (or, a scrotal hernia).
A scrotal hernia is an abscess enveloped by some covering similar to a pouch, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is necessary to fear that which preceded it (i.e., the cause of the hernia).
However, we must describe the operation on it as the first physicians did.
And I say that you must have the patient sit on a raised seat; then gently push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; then hold the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels that are near the penis; and let another assistant hold those, extending them with firm pressure.
And then incise with a sharp, broad scalpel in a transverse section to the right of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
And then flay the entire area as we have told you in the extraction of arrowheads that are lodged in the temples.
And then insert into them a double-threaded needle, and tie it at the first point where you made the incision, and tie it again at the other end. And then incise those in the middle lengthwise with a straight incision, and extract what has gathered of foul and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds in which you wish healing to be generated, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitalia do not rupture, for this is not harmful.
But if you injure all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be ligated along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they wither, or that they be tied off so that they receive no nourishment.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a tear that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen, on the side of the inguinal rings of the abdominal muscle, causing the intestines to protrude through that rupture.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur for many reasons: percussion, jumping, shouting, lifting something heavy, or similar.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is an inguinal abscess near the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a tear in the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and it is an abscess that appears differently under the skin of the groin, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body is outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" is likely a term specific to this text and its meaning may need further investigation within the context of medieval medical terminology.)
And sometimes it is formed with flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and the air is retained there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness, iron (or cautery) is dangerous, therefore its use should be avoided in this case.
And the method of operating on this is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to its cavity if it yields to repositioning; then, he should be positioned on his side between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then stretch the scrotum, which is the sac of the testicles, upwards, and incise the scrotum lengthwise; then insert two hooks into the lips of the incision, as you need to open the incision with them.
And if possible, according to the amount you can manage, let the egg (presumably referring to a hernia or some similar swelling) be expelled from the incision.
Then scrape away the skin which is under the scrotum until the hard white tissue is uncovered on each side.
Then insert your finger into what is the testicle, into what is between the white tissue, which is under the scrotum, and the second tissue layer, and break up with it the adhesion that is behind the testicle.
Then gently manipulate the scrotum upwards with your hand, and with this stretch the white tissue upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tissue towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to lift the testicle upwards while you completely dissolve the adhesions behind it.
And search with your fingers to ensure that there is no intestinal matter enveloped in the hard white tissue. But if you find any such matter, then push it back down into the abdomen.
And then incise in the area below the scrotum, through an incision from which blood and pus will flow, as we have recounted in what we have said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have mentioned (and sometimes the white tissue is cauterized, which we have said is near the incision to prevent bleeding, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and keep it there until it falls off as we have said.
Then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of a ventosity hernia (or Windy Hernia).
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that with facility; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with what opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that is made in the inguinal region.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and it swells the area.
And do not allow the genitals any cause of the intestines in the genitals; and if they do, it is little; and it returns in all hours.  (This is a somewhat awkward translation reflecting the awkwardness of the original.  A better paraphrase might be:  "And don't let the intestines protrude into the genitals; if some do, it's a minor issue, and it will retract on its own.")
But if the time with this is prolonged, a fissure is adjusted in the scrotum until the intestine descends into the scrotum; and this happens because of the extension of the scrotum which is in the groin as we have said, which cause is because the scrotum is extended, and then it is softened and the area is inflamed and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as its narration has preceded. (Meaning:  And it is treated with cautery, as described previously.)
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with incision across the width according to the amount of three fingers.
And then tighten the white scrotum that is under the perineum until it is uncovered. (A more natural phrasing might be: "And then pull taut the scrotum under the perineum until it is exposed.")
And then take the ray and place that on the prominent area of the scrotum, and press that to the abdomen.  (The word "ray" here likely refers to a surgical instrument.  A more accurate translation might be "...take the instrument and place it...")
And then sew the two prominent places on the extremity/end of the scrotum's ray (instrument), and join one of those to the other with a suture.
And then remove the end of the instrument, and do not incise the scrotum completely, nor extend the wound, nor do anything else like I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment for wounds, and as you incise the fibers, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; because the scrotum is constricted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health. (This implies cautery promotes healing in this specific location).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is spoiled.
Then it is necessary for the one who is charged with his cure to make the patient lie on his back, and to incise all the swelling which is softened over the natural swelling; and then that he join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, sew in the beginning the superfluity of the softened swelling with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then care for it with the treatment of other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because of necessity I am compelled to mention it in this book; and its mention is necessary only in two ways, one of which is so that the physician, when questioned about it, knows its treatment should it occur; and the other way is that we often have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit, such as horses, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion, or by incision.
But in that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is that we cause the animal to be bathed in warm water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. Then grasp them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear beneath the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the cord of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise over each testicle with a single incision until both testicles are exposed.
Then incise them after you have flayed each one. And do not leave on those of the cyphus any cause, but only the subtle cyphus which is over the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because forceful crushing leaves little cause of the testicles by which the animal desires copulation.
And then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two manners: one is that which appears as if there were a space in the scrotum, in that which is between two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that which is in the scrotum.
But in women, there is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman above the pubis is like two testicles of a man, somewhat smaller, externally similar to a man's prepuce and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: two for men and one type for women. And it is necessary that you incise those fleshy growths until the tumor is removed, and then that you treat them with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows that is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Concerning swelling and fleshy growths due to causes in women.
A lentigo (freckle or a similar skin growth) is easily formed from natural causes until it is irritated and becomes noticeable; and sometimes it is enlarged in some women to such an extent that it is spread like in men and extends to the genitals.
Then you should hold the excess of the lentigo with your hand or with forceps and incise it.
And do not overdo the incision, especially near the root, so that a flow of blood does not result.
And then treat it with wound care until it is healed.
Excess flesh (a fleshy growth) is flesh that grows in the womb of the mother until it fills it, and it quickly protrudes outwardly resembling a tail (and for this reason some first called this "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it as we incise a lentigo, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of gout.
Gout is when the vulva of the woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And this is either natural or accidental.
Accidental [gout] is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by improperly formed flesh or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or in her sides, or in her upper part, or in her lower part, and it prohibits conception and pregnancy and childbirth, and strongly inhibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by observing the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, [it is] profound; but if it is not apparent, then you seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane, and it is close to the two labia, then you cauterize and break it up.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then spread the two labia forcefully until that thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and keep it moist throughout the day so that the incised area does not close.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to fleshy growth, then lift it with a hook, and incise it.
And have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and enses (possibly referring to a type of plant or herb), mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close prematurely.
And keep it there for some days and apply a poultice of dry herbs.
And then it should be treated with the other healing method for consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the mother's birth of other flesh (likely referring to a difficult birth or a complication), and then it is necessary to incise according to this manner. But if this is due to a cranial abscess,  the cranial abscess which is in the mother should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids and of a boil or red tumor that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the orifices of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, they become boils (or abscesses).
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the womb of the mother and do not appear externally, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron (i.e., cautery or surgical instruments).
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which sensation is felt, are those that are treated.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cool place and then stretch the boil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise it at its roots.
And then sprinkle on those wounds the flow of blood with one of the incisive powders without biting [i.e., without causing further damage], such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumat (possibly a type of herb) and of pomegranate bark and of  woad and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to his back.
And if the blood is removed, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in comfrey juice or in henbane juice with red wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of the bladder accidentally occurring in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the mother, such as cancer, and stony abscesses, and ulcerations, and buboes, and erysipelas, and fistulas, hemorrhoids, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses, and their types, and their symptoms, and their treatments, in the division (or section).
And it is fitting that I should speak in this treatise of a hot abscess which occurs in the mother when it is one of the abscesses that collects pus; and if you wish to know in what manner its operation is performed with iron (a cautery).
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with throbbing, phlegm, and fever, and sometimes redness, and if you feel it, then do not attempt its perforation, but treat it with what aids maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you must make the woman sit on a chair that has two seats; and she should recline on her back and adjust her feet to the part just below her abdomen, and her thighs should be spread, and she should place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable ligature.
And then the midwife follows from the right side and provides the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will come in those things that are done next.
And it is necessary, when you wish to apply this instrument, that you place the point of the instrument on the cervix of the woman's womb, and that what is entered into the womb by the instrument should not exceed the cervix of the womb and hurt the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the cervix of the womb, then it is necessary that you place powders on the texture of the cervix of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the cervix of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the turning mechanism on the instrument from the upper side and that the person administering it hold the instrument and turn the turning mechanism until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the wound appears, and it is touched with the hand and is supple and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that wound with a linen cloth.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the compress on the section in the cervix of the womb.
And place outside the womb and over the vulva clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then let it be treated for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is rinsed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or of birthwort has been boiled, and then returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the womb, then you must be prohibited from treating it with iron,  instead treating it with what we have said in the previous section.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner live embryos should be treated when they are expelled in an unnatural way.
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the nature of a natural childbirth by its signs, and it is that when you see the woman straining in the lower parts and desiring to expel air, and on top of this she is relieved by what is above her from the birth, and hastens the expulsion of the embryo, then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the expulsion with its head first, and the afterbirth with it, or suspended or hanging from the umbilicus.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily because when it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleaned of those superfluities with a good cleansing.
But that which is otherwise is an unnatural and unfavorable birth, for when the embryo is expelled feet first and its body is expelled before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, is expelled, and quickly it is turned upon its neck, and similar to these unfavorable presentations.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is needed for them so that it may be understood and acted upon accordingly.
When the fetus is expelled head first by natural exertion, and this is strenuous for the woman and the birth is difficult for her, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit up, or have the women support her, and evaporate her genitals with cooked fenugreek and warm oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, flat spatula between her labia and with it she breaks the secundines (afterbirth), or scrapes it with her fingernail until the moisture within it is removed. And press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be given a clyster of mallow and fenugreek mucilage with honey.
Then order her, after the clyster, to be compressed and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must gently reduce them little by little. But if it does not obey the manipulation, then place the woman on a chair and raise her legs, and then shake the chair on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remaining part of the fetus, or tie the body to its hand with a cloth and extract it evenly, because that will be expelled.
When the fetus is presented feet first, then you must push it upwards, and then gently turn the fetus, and then grasp it, and then take one of its feet and gently extend it.
But when it has entered the birth canal, then you order her to strain, and make her sneeze forcefully, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then you gently return the fetus until you place it in its natural position, for then it will be expelled with ease.
And if it is prevented by all that we have recommended, then take mallow and dissolved gum mucilage, and thoroughly pound everything in a mortar, and then apply this to the woman's vulva, and the lowest part of her abdomen. And then make her sit in lukewarm water, until it reaches her hypochondria (the region of the body below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts are softened, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and apply it to her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and hold her mouth, and lift her up, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle compression, for the fetus will then be expelled immediately.
Thus of the fetus, laterally, holding one of its hands. Let it be managed by reduction of her hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with a vigorous shaking, and then administer bandages which I have recommended of mucilages.
And if childbirth has arrived, then make her sit on a chair, and then work on the reduction of the hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural shape, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
Thus of the fetus, upon the neck, its hands spread out, and its face is towards its mother. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little, and that this be done easily.
And when it is grasped, then place upon its head that which we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then command her to cough little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and command her to lean to the right side, and then command her to strain; and make her sneeze with a [suitable] concoction/mixture. The prepared fetus exits sideways.
When the horror of the mother ceases according to this manner, consider, and then you incise the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over its face and neck, then you incise it at the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
And then gently push the fetus inwards until you place it as it should be, and tell the woman to strain a few times, and it will be expelled easily in this way, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but this is strange and rarely happens; but there are reasons for it in nature, and they do not live.
And count those, even if they are numerous, as one birth, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them through the ligament in the umbilicus of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as if it were one fetus by easy natural expulsion, and are expelled sometimes by less desirable means as we have recounted.
And if some of their births are difficult and come to that which we have said of unnatural presentations, then you treat those as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with patience, and is ingenious according to every presentation, as is prepared for her by the skill leading to health.
A remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted or expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which cause was determined by the measurement of glorious wise men.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife, because it quickly seems similar to her, and therefore she opposes herself to it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
Concerning the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it is not yet expelled, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted with any of the accidents by which loss is feared for her.
Then the woman should be positioned on the bed on her side, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs raised.
And the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with moist oils and with a mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned to descend head first, and then you grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the appropriate places near the ribs, or below the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then at the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the umbilical cord with the right hand, and place its curvature in the space between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hand gently and grasp the umbilical cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until you reach the empty cavity (presumably the vagina).
And then place and attach another umbilical cord, or a third if necessary, so that there is equal traction, and it is not extended only along its straight length.
Rather, it should be pulled evenly from all sides, so that its extraction is eased, as is done in the extraction of a tooth.
And it is necessary in this that which is between them (presumably the birth canal) that the extension be softened; and if any part is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and skillfully insert them and loosen that which is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the umbilical cords should be moved to a higher position; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if one hand is delivered before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until all is expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should do with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction occurs during its expulsion, or there is accumulated water on its head, then it is necessary to insert a pointed, spatulate instrument between the fingers and perforate the head and extract the water, or to uncover it with an instrument which is named "alundat" (a word that seems to be specific to the text), the form of which will be shown with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is near this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with the alunda as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is expelled but constricted by the clavicles (furcula), then let it be incised so that the fluid which is in the feet may be poured out.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it yield to extraction, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the abdomen of the [fetus/patient, unclear from the context] is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it so that the fluid that is within it drains out.
But if the fetus is positioned on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its guidance to the mother's birth canal is easy.
But if it is constricted around the abdomen and feet, then you must extract it with a cloth that you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you incise the abdomen and feet until what is in them flows out.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head is turned, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's birth canal is open, then she inserts her hand into the vagina, and with it seeks the head, and draws it with her fingers towards the mother's birth canal, and then inserts into it one or two hooks, and pulls it out with them.
And if the mother's birth canal is constricted by a hot abscess which harms her, then it must not be disturbed; instead, it is necessary to administer a perfusion of humid, oily substances. And administer plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned: and what we have said should be administered in the case of a live fetus.
And if that is not possible, then let it be cut into pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no part of the afterbirth inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said concerning the treatment of hot abscesses which may befall the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after that, she became pregnant again, and soon after that, the fetus died also. It happened that for a long time there was an abscess in his navel; and it swelled until it burst open, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters of strong attraction to him, and I extracted a bone from him; and after a few days, I extracted another bone; and I was very surprised, since there should be no bone in the belly.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in her menses, and she lived in this way for a long time,  a little pus still draining from him.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but because in this there is science and help, so that the skilled physician with his hand administers the cure.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of incision by which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a tourniquet in which the limbs are bound, to which binding there are two incisions at the two ends of two poles. However, this incision should be more subtle than a constricting [instrument], and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers, and the thickness of each about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle space between the two pieces of wood there are two fittings of the same wood which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that she is opened with them when you turn the two prescribed poles.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity there are two additions like those you see, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with those, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, open what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the womb until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients called:
The form of the instrument with which the fetus is expelled:
The form of the instrument with which the large head is held back (or restrained).  The "2" likely indicates a variation or a second type of instrument.
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like a saw, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this form, like a saw, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw with which it is incised and held back (or restrained). The form of a small instrument:
The form of a hook having a spine (or point).
The form of a hook having two spines (or points).
The form of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed.
The form of two wide spatulas.
All these instruments are exercised, and when the types of these are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, then it is easier in its operation and more valued by men because of its quantity (or number).
And do not neglect those instruments, whatever they may be, that you have prepared, for the necessity of those is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should order the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully.  Hold your hand over her mouth and nose, and if it is expelled by this, it is good.
And if not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid, and place herbs in it, opening the mother's mouth; thus with [herbs such as]  calendula, rue, anise, chamomile, dried Arabic gum, cassia wood, and centaury. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
Then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there so that the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains and it is not expelled, then order the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when it is found, then take it and extract it little by little. But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then insert her hand as we have recounted, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not collapse from the vehement traction. Furthermore, it should be turned to the right and left sides with ease.
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and medication of the oil with herbs.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recommended, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction; however, what has come out from her to the mouth of the mother should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrapharmacon; for that will cause it to rot in a few days and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it rots, a foul odor rises to her head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then fumigations suitable for this should be administered.
But some of the Ancients already proved the efficacy of fumigation with hellebore and dried figs.
Method of instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the secundines (afterbirth):
Let it be made of glass or brass.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation be placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold that until that fumigation is consumed and then another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [likely referring to lead-based ointments].
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur below. (This is a heading or title, indicating the start of a new section on the treatment of fistulas.)
The fistulas that occur in the lowest part below are knotty and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space between one part [i.e., between parts of the anus].
And it is one fistula or several.
And when that knot is old and discharges a watery white moisture or fine pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because what comes out of them is a discharge and flatulence; and sometimes the patient has a discharge, and worms quickly come out of them.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the space [between the anus and genitals], into the bladder, and into the meatus of the penis; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the anus from one that is not penetrating, is that you put your finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything come out of the opening, neither discharge nor worms nor flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meatus of the penis, then the sign of it is the incontinence of urine from it and the prohibition against that so that the place with medicine may be consolidated [healed].
But if it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the circumference, then the sign of it is that the probe enters there if there is no tortuosity in it into the bone, and causes pain in the circumference of the part; and that from it comes purulence constantly; and that medication is of no use to it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no certain cure, and the cure of those is the labor and vanity of foolish physicians, upon which they are fixed [insist].
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I will recommend to you, and this which I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs up, his thighs inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your finger into the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the probe already by itself discovered penetrating, besides what you feel between your finger and that suppuration or flesh, then you know certainly that that is penetrating; and then do not work on that, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
But however, some say that it is healed in some men late.
And of the medication by which help is hoped for him is that you ignite a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as is previously done, and introduce that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those fleshy fistula parts resembling the quill of a bird's feather are cauterized.
And then treat that with warm poultices until all those cauterized tissues slough away, and then treat that with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it is not healed at any time by another treatment.
And if the probe enters and does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a noticeable thickness of flesh or suppuration, and you see the fistula in that which is the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry with the probe, and be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe arrives, and through the probe it is freed and cut.
And then cleanse those fistula tissues which resemble a bird's quill and let no part of them remain.
But if you see a flow of blood come between you and your operation when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good effects: that is, cauterization of those affected tissues and staunching of the blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flax until the place is free from pus, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate firm flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and desiccation; when it is thus restored, it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and extends from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and investigate with it.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a layer of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then it is not an operation on it, except by way of trust and hope.
Which requires one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that you can introduce the poultices and the cure is close; and do not proceed much with incision so that you do not cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that this may happen to the patient without their will; and then treat it with what we have said, for it will heal very quickly; or lengthen that layer and clean it of pus after drying it near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or other instrument with a sharp tip, and then clean those fistulous tissues which are in the incision as far as you can with scraping; and then strive to effect the restoration of the whole wound with incision, and if the upper orifice is not closed, and the fistula remains open in the part of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is located in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the tail and in the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing skins in this way:
and insert it into that [fistula] wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it penetrates into the margin of the anus further inside, then you pull the thread out of that hole so that you can insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues are cut which are between the two ends of the thread and fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and consolidated.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it is very close to the rectum, because it is not up to you to do that so that you do not cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed probe with which the fistula is opened: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as sometimes happens.
On the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for they are either between the buttocks similar to coals, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these there are small and large ones, and blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are usually of little moisture, from which flows citrine water or a little blood with continuous flow, and it is according to the complexion of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you carefully grasp and lift them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them to their roots.
But if the hooks cannot grasp them because of their moisture and softness, then grasp them with rough cloth or cotton or a pledget of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act there in place of cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not readily allow for protrusion, then  stimulate the patient with a mild irritant, and let it be washed with the liquid that is in the anus and that easily permits protrusion when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you grasp them with your fingernail, or that you grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, you must suture as follows: take waxed thread and insert it into a needle and then bring the hemorrhoids together from their upper parts, and make the needle penetrate at the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and this should be laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong ligature, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them untied, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that on the anus and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat them with ointments or with other treatment until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moistened and the outer layer above is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then you remove them with more force than the first time until they bleed a lot and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a felon, that is, a whitlow, is nothing but a red nodule according to the color of the body, similar to a carnation head, and it is found throughout the body and especially in the parts below the feet and fingers, and because of this pain you must treat it.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the whitlow be incised, and held with forceps or tweezers, and eradicated from its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described in its chapter.
Furthermore, a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you extend and incise it, or that you bind it tightly with thread or a hair so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize that, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic substance).
Furthermore, an anthill (or possibly a specific type of growth resembling an anthill) is a small, rough or fistulated, large eminence on the surface of the body, spreading widely in the preon (possibly a specific area or the pubic region), and when friction encounters it, it is felt like the bite of an ant, and it is formed around the body (or perhaps "all around the body").
And its cure is that you take a cannula made from a goose quill or a vulture quill, and let it be strong, and place that over the anthill until the circle of the cannula contains its parts; and then rotate your hand with the cannula until you incise what is in the circumference of the anthill, and place that in the depth of the flesh, and so you eradicate the anthill from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula, according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thin point, blunt (that is, non-perforated), wrapped so that the grip on it is eased and its rotation facilitated.
And if you wish, cauterize the anthill as was previously described in the cauterization of athel in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the instruments that are used to administer a clyster.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or tin, or melted or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are fragile or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of its cannula, to which the bag is attached, should be wide in this manner; and let there be a distinction where the bag is tied, as you see.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (that is, not open) very smooth, tapering to a point; and on one side of it let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And let the bag, in which the medicines are placed, be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and let its length be one palm.
And let it be perforated with many holes, as it is rolled up; and let the space between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, raw flax threads, about ten of them, or thereabouts; and tie the bag with them; and when the bag is placed in position, tie it tightly at the head of the clyster with two distinct strong ligatures, and then cauterize each hole with it: But the manner of cauterizing with it is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs and place under him a cushion on which are placed men or a linen cloth; and then anoint the end of the clyster with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or the like; and then insert it into the anus easily, and then the attendant should take the bag and squeeze it with both hands and vigorously until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers his legs to the ground.
And if the medicine forces him to defecate, hold it as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you cauterize it in cases of diarrhea and the evacuation troubles him, then you repeat the clyster until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then the clyster should be very fine and soft, of the kind with which infants are clysterized.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division on wound treatment what was appropriate to the book, and I say thus the treatment of these with hand and medicines according to their needs.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes the wounds and according to the location where the wounds occur.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are thus:  a stone throw, or an incision from a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar things from many causes.
But wounds that are in the locations of the body are such as a wound which falls on the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those of the other limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or the like, and it has only wounded the scalp and is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should immediately take care of it and phlebotomize the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract blood from it according to the patient's strength, unless some other cause prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has flowed from the wound is slight.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and rich foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his diet be reduced and let him not approach meat nor wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a cotton cloth soaked in plain rose oil or in wine in which a styptic has been dissolved.
But if it is certain that a hot abscess will form, then place on the fresh wound its own blood, if the air has not altered it; and the powder which I shall shortly describe.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is caused by a sword or similar instrument, and its edges are not joined by themselves, then join them with sutures as I shall describe in the section on sutures.
But if the wound has exposed the bone and hangs open, and there is no retention of it but only a small suspension, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh gradually in place of the bone, and instruct the patient to eat foods that are coarse:  heads and cooked vegetables and the like, until it is mended.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you shall incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood may occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you shall investigate the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you shall cut it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you to do what we have said is not appropriate, then you shall cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore you shall sprinkle this powder on them, for it consolidates them before the air changes them.
And the manner of the powder is this: take olive oil, one part, dragon's blood, two parts, and unslaked lime, three parts; let all be finely ground and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with powders and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, that it is not suppurated, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done only with lime, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to apply it to them and they are fresh and with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is summer time, then this powder is not suitable, but rather treat them with what we have said, that is to say, apply digestive ointments to them, or apply barley flour powder with water and honey until they stop festering; and then treat them with other cures until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with tweezers.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no other remedy than to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as vitriol or similar substances, because they harm the nerves and constrict them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and they are connected to the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with mild remedies, such as washing with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and afterward washing with fresh water and other suitable ointments in this manner, and moist unguents.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or draw the edges together, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or there is pus in the lowest part, then perforate it in the lowest point.
But if an artery is incised in the wound and bleeding results, then separate or cut it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all of them have been incised, and the veins of the neck have been saved, then you should approximate the edges of the wound with sutures over the cervical spine and do not touch that; first equalize it and restore it to its natural shape, and then bind it with a suitable dressing, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments which have astringent and stimulating properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has damaged the bone, then cauterize it, and if there are bone fragments, extract all those that you can; and what you cannot manage, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the injury is relieved.
And if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be mentioned in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a venting of air from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its blood, then you should put powder on it in the first hour, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but put attractive ointment on it, and unbind it twice a day.
And if you don't have ointment at hand, then place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is within it flows out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and the patient has not suffered spasms, or tremors of the heart, or constriction of the throat, and you see his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore, treat it according to its chapter [i.e., according to the instructions given elsewhere in the text for treating fistulas].
And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with the previously described suture if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if a piece of bone has been broken, and large pieces have been detached from it, then you should enlarge the wound and try to extract those pieces if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound suppurates, so that their extraction is facilitated.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the treatment is similar to what we have already described.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen.
The indisposition which happens in the belly is either great, or small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it is so that their reduction is more difficult if you do not take care of their replacement in their place immediately, because it opens and swells, wherefore its entry is made difficult.
Therefore, the moderate rupture is best, because in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that the suturing of the belly is according to four methods, but two sutures are common, which are suitable for suturing other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures are proper to other wounds, but however they are more proper in the suturing of the belly.
And I recount to you each one with exposition and explanation.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has come out through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed by the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil in water squinant, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with this until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this is done with something which has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And so when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and althea have been boiled, for by this the reduction of it is aided with little difficulty.
But if the reduction is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate that there is no incision, and there is no need to dry due to necessity and weakness.
Of the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the end is thin, and not as thin as a spatula, rather it should be slightly blunt.
And thus, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should follow its natural form, to its proper place, if possible in this way, for it is better.
But when the rupture is large, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise their head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant gently place their hands between your hands, who will hold the entire rupture with their hand and adjust its lips, and then discover from this to that which might be suitable for the suture, something else nearby.
And this is the common method of suturing: first you take the needle, or a number of needles according to the size of the wound; then leave the extremity of the rupture of the ring finger, and tighten one needle, provided that you do not put thread in the two extremities of the suture, with two extremities of the knot that is under the suture of the inner parts, until you make it penetrate that part; and you have already joined two extremities of the suture and two extremities of the knot, and thus four orders are made.  (Note:  This is a very difficult sentence, the medical terminology and the construction are quite complex.  The translation attempts to convey the meaning, but minor ambiguities may remain due to the archaic and technical language.)
Then tighten with double thread in the circuit of the needle, and sometimes from two sides together, and then join the two lips and the wound with a decent joining; and then leave the width of a finger and place another needle in that space, and then tie it with thread just as you did with the first needle; and do not cease to do this if necessary with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium size between thickness and thinness, because thin needles easily injure the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the suture, and therefore they should be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted too deeply into the two extremities of the suture, so that the flesh is not lightly injured and the wound does not open before its consolidation.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be hindered from healing.
Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during their sleep; and you will place on the suture powdered herbs from all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient in small wounds, because one or two needles or thereabouts suffice for their closure.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you stitch together the four extremities of the wound and two extremities of the lip, at once, with a needle on which thread is wrapped equally in thinness and thickness.
Then, when you have penetrated these four extremities with the needle, return the needle to the same point from which you began, so that the drawn thread lies from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is like the stitching of cloth with which cloths are tightened.
And place between each suture the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was more than a palm, and two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the wound, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and after that he lived for many years, and remained in good health.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle, because I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine was found, but I put old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I shall describe two kinds of sutures, properly, according to the account of Paraula. (Note: "Paraula" likely refers to a person or text the author is referencing.)
And it is that you begin with the suture of the cord, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so when the needle penetrates the cord and that same laceration, according to its width and length across the whole body, leave the end of the thread in which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside to the outside at the other extremity of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again at that same extremity of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is at this point, and make the needle penetrate at the other extremity from the inside to the outside.
And make the penetration with that [needle] with which you make the penetration in the thread at the extremity of the wound which is on his side until all of it penetrates.
And then begin from that same side and sew that [wound] with the end of the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the wound which it penetrated, and then return it into that wound and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this extremity of the wound; and extract it from the wound which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time until you sew up everything that is outside according to that example.
And the summary of this manner of suture is that you sew with a suture of skins, with which you sew skins, in such a way that you sew the thread one time from the part of the extremity of the wound, and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second proper kind of suture, which I call "Gualia," and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which certain medicants sew it, in such a way that you join each part to its corresponding part conveniently for nature; and you apply the end of one to the other end and the end of the wound to the other end, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you place the needle at the extremity of the wound closest to you, on the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that sole place, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside through two ends of the thread.
And then turn them each, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part through two other ends of the wound that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which I have previously made mention.
This is the discourse of/on Gualia.
And moreover, some say the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, that you insert a thread into each of these, and begin with the needle insertion from the side nearest to you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew the hearts similarly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine and sew it and dress it properly, then place incarnative powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments that are present to you until they form a hard scab and shed the threads, and are consolidated by cyprus and myrrh; and then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then immediately apply, as soon as it begins to suppurate, old linen, and change that twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread infection to the principal members, then you should submerge lion wool in oil of good quality, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the places that are between the armpits and below the shoulders.
And if you sense pain or putrefaction in the intestines, because this often happens, then cauterize it with lukewarm black styptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound that falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of the magnitude of those that are in it, and because of the subtlety of the body of that, and because of the proximity of that to the nature of the nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the web (likely referring to a membrane or tissue), and you obtain that recently, reduce it according to your method with which you reduce the intestines equally.
But if it has passed to the space and has already become green or black, then bind it with gall over the location that is blackened by it, so that a flow of blood comes, because in the web are veins and arteries.
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the gall hanging from the part below the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it towards the falling of the web and the emission of the arm of the wound is relieved for you.
A remembrance/reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because of this, for I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance thrust and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and a fistula had formed, and from it came gesticulation (movement) and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to refine the treatment until it was healed and the place was consolidated (closed).
And I, after I saw the place consolidated, feared for the patient that some accident of illness might befall him in his belly; and no such ill accident happened, and he remained in good condition eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and exercised himself in his movements/actions.
And some experienced people have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner:  that you take ants with large heads; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, with its mouth open, over the two lips of the wound; then when it seizes upon those and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not be dissolved.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease doing this with ants, one next to the other, according to the size of the whole wound.
And then reduce that and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and let no harm come to the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the gut of an animal, attached with it, since it is passed through a needle; and it is that you take the end of these gut threads, and it should be very clean, and then tie its end with its thread, wrapped, and then insert that thread in needles and sew with it the intestine, and reduce it to the disruption/rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, for then it is only a thinning, and not a complete healing of it.
Concerning the treatment of fistula and abscess.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whatever limb it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we call it that *azukem* (likely a regional variation or misspelling).
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, knotted formation, without pain, and which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and for this reason it is called a knotted ulcer, that is, claw-like.
And in some men it is moist, which discharges pus; and very quickly the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes it is thin, and sometimes it is abundant, and sometimes it is scant.
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their treatment with medicines in the division (section).
And it is fitting that I make known to you the treatment of fistula, which is done by means of surgery with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those which cause damage to the member nearby and similar ones.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is of the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if there is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent along the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has many horrible twists, it is not possible for you to explore it with a probe.
Then, irrigate the orifice through its openings, for the liquid with which you irrigate it will go through the other openings and clean them.
And then inquire diligently, in whatever way it is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves there, and if the depth of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a fistula which has many openings, and attend to all this with the sum of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all these causes with true judgment, then proceed to the cure with confidence: and it is that you consider then if it is a fistula readily apparent and close, or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula as previously described in the narration, and remove what is in that infiltration and of corrupted flesh, and that which has grown in the opening of the flesh, or of skin and similar things, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it as far as is possible for you, and then clean it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause from a vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause it to grow flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and throws off pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and meticulously perform the scraping and cleansing of it with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in the distant depths of the body, which you have not reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then remove it with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously perform the extraction of all of them, and of those do not leave any part behind with your strength.
But if some matter of the humors hinders you, and in their incision there is no fear nor error, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then place on the wound something that will suppurate the wound, and leave it until it has reached the area of those bones, flesh and ligaments, and watch the wound so that it does not close, and keep constricted the incision which you made in your operation.
Then, if you fear, place on it a cloth dipped in crushed rue with oil, or a cloth dipped in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments suppurate, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is eased.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only superficially until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and to completely incise it to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, around thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts, a swelling arose, with matter forming within the body until the matter reached the thigh; it was the matter of an abscess, a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time was extended with that [illness] through the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it; and its healing was delayed until the leg was fistulated, and many orifices were made in it, all of which discharged pus and the humors of the body.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no improvement in his condition, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter running from those orifices in great quantity; and already the body of that man was completely weakened and his complexion was yellowish.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I quickly examined all the orifices and found that they reached to all parts of the leg.
And then I considered and incised one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already earthy and rotten and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, so that it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed off what was exposed to me and prepared the exposed bone.
And I thought that in the bone there was only that corruption which I cut away and sawed, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, and it is not consolidated.
And then I returned and uncovered the bone a second time on top of the first uncovering, and I found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed away what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was unable to perform its cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, and I forced its restoration, and it was not restored until I incised about a palm's breadth of it, and that I extracted with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it is lightly consolidated and healed.
And iteration in its operation and section is not necessary except for the disposition of its fragility and for the little tolerance it has and its fear of death, because syncope afflicted it at all hours due to superfluity of evacuation.
And therefore it is healed by complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in its body is made good and its virtue returned; and it is conserved in its dispositions and did not cause it contrariety in walking nor harm in any matter.
But if the bone is prominent in the place of the flesh already taken away, then it is necessary that you treat that according to this manner: that you take a ligature and bind that at the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend that upwards; and place that wool ligature thicker than the first ligature; and then tie that upon the flesh which is beneath the bone, and extend the extremity of it so that you draw the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh upon the place which you want to close so that the closure does not injure the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board decently under the bone, for when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done on the corrupted place little by little, for if the corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its appearance to the senses, then force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, in that one part is continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle place or in part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw that from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous to the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the place of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason but ingenuity [or skill/cleverness] in it.
And if the corruption is in the breast of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you investigate the corruption in whatever manner appears to you, and that you open that, and clean that according to each disposition which is possible for you, and with each ingenuity it should be rectified for you, when it does not oppose you vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws to incise these bones are many according to the location of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the thickness of those, and the subtlety and the size and the smallness of those, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the kind of instrument of which you have need; when with you is great study and long and knowledgeable experience of the manners of this art, and witness of many illnesses, for then you will already have for yourself that which is convenient in instruments for every illness.
And I am forming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will place with yourself, with which you will proceed to your prohibition which you will experiment on others.  (The "prohibition" likely refers to a surgical procedure or treatment.) Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or spoke): Let the head of this spoke be according to the form of a star-shaped nail head, and its points be according to the form of the points of a  (perhaps "stitching awl" or "awl-like" depending on the intended meaning of "alstefegi").
And it is only suitable that with that (instrument) the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the opening is very wide.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a broad/wide razor:
Form of another saw decently made: let it be made of the most excellent arc (possibly referring to the shape or material) and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of well-made wood. Its form/shape/design:
Form of a razor which has a concavity (or hollow):
Form of another, subtle (or fine/delicate) razor:
Form of another razor with a curved extremity (or end):
Form of a small razor resembling a probe (or tentacle, depending on the intended meaning of "tenta"):
Form of another, smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor; this one resembles a ray (or perhaps a kind of fish), and its extremity is like a saw, and is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Form of a ray (or perhaps a tool shaped like a ray) which is suitable for the treatment of those bones which are perforated:
And its extremity is triangulated and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have said of razors, and of incisors, and of saws [apply to this tool as well].
Concerning the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Extremities may be affected either by an intrinsic or extrinsic cause. If you have treated that corruption with the appropriate medicines and the treatment is ineffective, or if you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb to the extent the corruption reaches, so that the patient escapes death or the greater harm of limb loss.
And the sign of this condition is that the limb turns black as if burned by fire, or the blackness spreads until the decay reaches the limb, threatening the whole body; therefore, treat it with an incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the impact of some poisonous creature, such as a sea scorpion, viper, or spider, and similar things.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then you should incise the finger and not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
Similarly, if it affects the hand, then you should incise it at the root of the hand, and not allow the corruption to spread to the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case the patient will die; and to administer any other treatment besides this is pointless.
Similarly, with the foot: if the corruption affects a toe, then you should incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the heel of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him, only dismissal, and to leave the patient to death.
And the manner of incising or cutting the limb is that you should tighten a ligature on the part below which you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the location; and let the assistant extend one ligature to the lower parts, and let the assistant extend another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures in such a way that all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or cut.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient receives a proper dressing and a hot poultice.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while operating, then you should carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some blood-stanching powders; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burning that resembled a burn from fire.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe before it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, for he saw the cure proceeding to the limb with such vehemence that he was overcome by pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and it was healed.
For a long time he suffered that same corruption in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that superfluity with what I applied to his hand by means of medicines, namely the purification of his body; and the superfluity was not repelled and began to spread to another finger before it began in the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that superfluity, and more so fearing lest the incision of his hand prove fatal, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he departed from me, he returned to his own land, and it was reported to me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And this narrative is included only to be of help in the case of this illness, and to be a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses and the nature of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy member and the space of the abscess is extended until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus has come out of it, and the place remains empty, almost as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is over it is like thin cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and it does not impinge on bone, or nerve, or ligament, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is extended to the point that the corruption affects any member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its treatment is that you incise that skin entirely as it is swollen, especially when it is thinned and made like cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres and that the corruption has not reached further, and there is a thickening of the skin, then you treat that with a clyster.
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the arm that is there has a foul odor, then you should clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine which is of oil and sharp wine and resin, taking equal parts, and they should be mixed in a vessel, and boiled over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then you take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with that, and tighten its orifice, and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
And then extract that with a syringe; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with lye water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is that you take the ashes of vines, and put water over them; and then filter that and clysterize with it until you are sure that the sinus is clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the lye water, then clysterize it with water and honey and to which crushed resin is added, and clysterize with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, and especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure that the sinus is clean, then clysterize it with something that will cause flesh to grow there.
And it is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you clysterize it with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, such that the clyster cannula cannot be inserted, then you should widen it little by little with a small instrument, and place in it a small, warm object wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should approximate its edges with a suture and leave an opening sufficient for the clyster to enter without addition.
And if the opening from which the pus flows is situated higher than the surrounding area, then drain it at the lowest point so that the pus flows downwards, for when the pus is contained within the depth of the sinus, flesh will not grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus into the lowest point of the surrounding area as you wish, then you should endeavor to prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus flows lightly as it is possible for you, and that no pus remains within.
But the cloth that is over the opening of the sinus, change that every hour so that what is collected there of the pus may come out. And so that you may know if the pus that flows from it is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, observe the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment continues in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged onto the opening of the sinus has already adhered, or tends to adhere, then after three days you should loosen it, and when you loosen the dressing, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if near the sinus there is a subtle poison, then do not be surprised by its adherence, for its healing is approaching, for there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and there are those in whom the opposite occurs.
And if undigested pus has flowed from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying quality of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry, such as diafinicon ointment, when there is an added superfluity of  zegi in it.
And the best final remedy with which it is cured is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and let old wine be added to it, equal in substance to the ointment, and mix it well and use this.
And it acts similarly in that case, when there is no pus: diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use this; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind everything and powder it over honey while it is on the fire, then spread this on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and spread this cooked, thickened honey, and powder it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes long birthwort and roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and flour of rye and centaury are administered with it, and use these simples or compounded, grind them, sieve them, and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use this.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in its depth, and it has already affected the bones or other hard parts or the ligaments; then you treat it with fistula treatment, as described above.
Concerning the treatment of paronychia, and of a worn nail, and of an added incision of the finger, and of a section (of the finger).
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger of the hand or foot, and easily spreads to other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less valued, or it is suppurated from a hot abscess, or it is corrupted, and it throws out pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and easily corrupts the whole nail, and easily spreads its corruption to the bone until there is a foul odor, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
And therefore, when you have treated it with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the superfluous matter that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound, for a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, already emptied, compress the flesh at the sides, and begin to prick and hurt it, then it is necessary that you place a thin file under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it up and incise that flesh easily, and apply to what remains of the flesh corrosive medicines until it is all consumed; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for a bone that is corrupted will never heal.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, then you should incise it at one of the joints, as its cure requires, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers from percussion or abrasion, and there is vehement pain in it, then you should first bleed the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse section from top to bottom, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause the patient vehement pain, and it will be a cause for the generation of superfluous flesh in the area; and then treat the area with something that relieves pain.
But a finger, which is born in the hands of some men, is quickly all fleshy, and quickly becomes bony, or quickly becomes a nail.
And some of them are born at the root of a joint, or their growth is in some of the joints of the fingers. But that which is born in some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is quickly afflicted.
And of those that are born fleshy, the section is easy, and it is that you incise that below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of a joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the joints, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their many joints, whether by the nature of the man who is born thus, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as is necessary.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you separate that consolidation according to what is prepared and appropriate to the shape of the limb.
Of incisions of vices, that is varices (varicose veins).
Varices are veins, swollen and thick, full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and most often in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and burden-bearers.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
But the cure of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be raised and entirely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, feculent blood of the leg is resolved.  Then bind the patient's leg tightly from the upper part of the thigh to the area below the knee with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision, and then draw the black blood upwards with your hand from the lower part of the leg to the upper, and from the upper to the lower, until you have drawn out the quantity you desire and which you consider sufficient, and which will remove the patient's ailment.
And then bind it up, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But their elevation is according to this manner: you who shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, and then place him in a bath and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are distended; or, if a bath is not available, have him engage in strenuous exercise until the limb is warmed.
Then incise the vein in a lengthwise cut along the vein itself, either behind the knee, or at the lowest point below the heel.
And then open the vein with an incision and scrape the vein on all sides until it feels sensitive, and it is by its appearance that you will see that redness turning to blackness.
And then, when you have opened the vein, you will see that white which is like a cord.
Then you place a leech below it so that it is raised and drawn from the vein, and suspend it with a gold or lead weight.
Then make another incision near that incision for three fingers' breadth, and scrape the vein from the area above the vein until it appears.
Then raise it and incise it at the back incision near the heel, and then extract it and raise it until it comes out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until all of it is out; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you to extract and elevate it, then insert a double-pointed needle with strong thread and tie it and extract it, or insert a leech below it and move your hand everywhere until it is drawn out. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to elevate it much and it has become harmful to the patient because of that damage.
And when it is all removed, then place on the wound site wool soaked in rose wine and un-rose-flavored olive oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having tortuosity to which there is constriction in parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you incise it at every part of its tortuosity and at the places of constriction, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it completely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not sharpened like hooks, nor is it of a sharp point so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of thick flexibility, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness; thus it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like in al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little humidity, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And very easily it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, scabies, and worms are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of this vein is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg; and nearby the place is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one to two drachms, and tie it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as you see something of it coming out externally, wrap that in lead and tie it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise the root until it has emerged, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled completely and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein there has emerged in some men [a growth] that is five palms and fingers in length, and it has already happened to me that one of twenty palms emerged.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then introduce a probe into the opening and perforate it with a long opening through the body, until all that is in the material is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch emerges from each orifice.
And therefore treat it as we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision above worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is shown by the feeling of its movement from member to member until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and snakes and earthworms and ascarids happen in the belly.
And it is feared for its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and arrives at the eye, then very quickly it opens it and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is not done except by its movement and appearance to the feeling, and then it is necessary that you tighten that which is above it and that which is below it with strong binding and constriction, and then dry above it and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you place a cautery with fire on the place until it dies, and the greatest cause that is feared is its corruption, with which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then tighten above the eyebrow with a strong binding, and then dry above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of their body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard against foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the disease nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small inflammation in the superficial vein of the arm, and after it remained for an hour, I saw that inflammation moving like a worm going upwards, but more lightly than one would expect, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and there it remained for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I realised that it was moving throughout her body, as I had seen; and I was greatly amazed by its change of location and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain moving from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes as clearly as in this woman.
And I considered that this was so because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in her this shifting windiness was clearly perceptible.
And it is necessary that it does not appear, according to this reverse cure, in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on that place lightly and dry it until the constricted windiness is expelled, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with the expulsion of humors and with things that expel windiness, and drive it away with foul-smelling pills and pills of scammony and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they fall, for their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and some that have three angles, and some that have barbs; and some that have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it and pierces the bone and emerges from the skull which is above the brain, for there happens a sudden vehement pain, and scotoma (blind spot), and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of the mind and vomiting of bile, and quickly the speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed, and there issues from the place of the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and pus similar to the watery part of the flesh.
And therefore, if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, are that it is near the left nipple, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not something empty; and quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death approaches without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are thus:  foamy blood issues from the wound, and the vessels that are near the neck are swollen, and the color of the patient is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the intake of cool air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm which is in the chest, the pain then is near the small ribs, and the breath is drawn in with great pain and with sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are moved.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is fixed there, some tearing comes from the wound, or the flesh, or the intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope in its cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out, and some matter proceeds from it to the outer parts, and very quickly pain comes upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the chest, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the greatest likelihood when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you, that which I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may signify by this [information] concerning your cure.
The reason is, because in one man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side, below the lobe of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into him in the lobe of his eye, below the eyelid, further below; and the arrow was already hidden, and I found only a small extremity of it, with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with an iron head, on which there were no barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill accident befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had fallen into his throat; and it was an Arabic arrow, and it had barbs; and then I incised over it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I was subtle with it, and I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and then, after thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I incised over the arrow and I extracted it, and he was healed, and no ill accident befell him.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his back, and the wound healed over him; and after about seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow fell in her belly, and the wound healed within her, and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman found no hindrance in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound healed and the arrow broke, finding no great pain there, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king's man that had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already inclined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure about the wounding by the arrow within three days.
And then I found the wound of the arrow very narrow; and then I examined it with a subtle probe, and I did not feel it; but he felt a prickling below his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was due to the point of the arrow.
And I plastered the place with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could operate on it.
And no significant accident occurred in the place that the arrow had reached; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound was consolidated meanwhile, and the patient refrained from extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I examined it, and found the subtle point of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I applied to the appearance of the wound that sharp medicine until the point of the arrow appeared to me visibly, and I spent time with this for a period of four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to subtly devise and contrive concerning it with ingenious methods, until one day I began to take it with ingeniously crafted forceps, according to the form which will be shown at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed completely, and I did not harm him in any way.
And I recount to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows so that you may take this as a rule and explanation for what I have not said, for the parts of this art and its definitions are not understood by narration nor do books comprehend them.
And wise artisans compare the little with the much; and that which is present with that which is absent; and they find new operations and instruments because of the descent of strange things from the art when it happens.
Therefore I say that arrows are not removed from the members in which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they enter; or by the opposite side.
And that which is removed from the place where it entered, is an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place, and is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield to such a method at the time it is found, then it is necessary that you leave it for a few days until the flesh surrounding it softens, and its extraction and removal are eased.
And similarly, if it is fixed in bone and does not yield to you in this way, then leave it for a few days and repeat the attempt with traction and movement each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if it still does not yield after a few days, then you must perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a fine drill until the space around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and is beyond feeling, then you should probe for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it out with instruments suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the probe, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should enlarge the wound so that it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is held by barbs, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded, by any means you can; and work on this, if you cannot manage the removal of the flesh by breaking the barbs and twisting them until they release.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting with your hand and forceps on all parts until it yields; and proceed with great care so that the arrow is not broken and that the extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then try again, for then it will be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then administer the treatment we described in the appropriate chapter.
And be careful about incising a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use every possible method to remove the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore, counter the arrow so that the patient is positioned according to the trajectory of the arrow's entry, for this is most beneficial. But if that is not possible, then administer what is possible according to the circumstances.
But if arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if some part of the arrow projects outwards, or if the arrowhead is bent due to the feeling of the part above the deep wound and you see this protrusion; then you should cut around it; and the incision should be the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will come out easily in this way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead is freed from the bone, and widen the opening, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still inside, then push it through.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you wish to administer a push, then introduce, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity of it fits the tail of the arrow, and then push it through.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then push it through with a strong instrument entering into it, for the arrow will be eased out by it.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with whatever is appropriate.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut it out, then cut it out and be careful not to cut any vein or nerve, and remove it, and then dress the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The form of forceps with which arrows are drawn:
Let the ends of them be like a bird's beak, which are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the constriction of the location.
like a ray, so that the entry into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number to bleed from is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins which are in the two apparent temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes which are called aspicientz; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose; and two guidegi which are at the neck; and two veins which are in the upper lip; and two veins which are in the lower lip; and – these are the veins which are called algelic –; and there are two veins which are under the tongue. But the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these there is one cephalic, and it is on the ulnar side; and the common people call it "the vein of the head", and it is a deep vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people call that one "the vein of the whole body", and the basilica is the vein which is situated on the radial side, and it is called "citillar", and the vulgar people call that one "the vein of the belly"; and the funis of the arm, and it is situated on the forearm, and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and the salvatella, and it is the vein which is between the index finger and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is that which is below the bend of the knee on the ulnar side; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg on the radial side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the ulnar side; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of opening the veins near the ears is for chronic catarrhs, migraine, headaches, and old, bad head ulcers.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is that the patient's head should be shaved, and the patient's head should be rubbed at the occiput in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then the patient should tighten their neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed areas of the head; and feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, then bleed them there with a lancet.
Then you take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and you insert it under the vein in the incision until the blood flows. Then raise your hand with the vein and the incision to the upper parts and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers laid together, or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already, at the beginning of the book, the incision of these and their cauterization has been described.
But of the two arterial veins that are at the temples, bloodletting is beneficial for chronic migraine, sudden severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and a flow of acute superfluities poured into the eyes.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on these is as I have explained to you:  constrict the patient's neck very tightly until the two veins appear visibly to the senses, and their pulse is felt beneath your finger; and then you should bleed with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein in the upper parts with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards; and incise it just as you have done with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your needs.
Then loosen the constriction on the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it tightly above, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the remembering of them, and of their incision, and the drawing [of blood] has been preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the usefulness of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is similar to phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I recounted to you; that is, that the patient constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a fossor, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossor upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or with another similar thing in that manner, and let the blood flow according to the quantity which you wish; and then untie the patient's constriction and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of acute extremity as are the other phlebotomies, but rather of blunt extremity, and perform that phlebotomy across [the vein], because the bone is near and would easily break there if the phlebotomy were subtle [or thin].
But the usefulness of the two veins that are at the lacrimal ducts of both eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for stiffness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across rather than lengthwise, a little with a small phlebotomy tool, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy tool is thin, its point will be broken very easily.
And then let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton over it, and bind it tightly for a night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and violent headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and swelling that occurs in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient constricts his neck, and then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin phlebotomy tool and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge in a straight line, because the vein is not palpable there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
As you slowly withdraw your hand with the small phlebotomy tool, let the blood flow according to your needs; and then bind it for a night, because it is easily restored.
But bloodletting from the two jugular veins helps with the constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy and many diseases, impetigo, and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those veins is that the patient tightens each one on his neck with a ligature; and the practitioner stands over the patient's head, and the patient sits on a stool.
Then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy tool little by little; and then extract blood according to a moderate quantity or according to what you see is necessary; and then do the same with the other vein.
Then untie the ligature and tighten the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And bloodletting from the alveolar veins benefits small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those veins is that you make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage, and then roll up his lips and look for two veins, one on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the indication of each is by the darkness of each of the two, and this is more so because in the area of those are small black veins; and then incise each with an incisive incision.
But if you have doubt, and you do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger of those veins, and the most evident of them.
And do likewise for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, it is advantageous to perform phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in cases of inflammation that are in the throat, for disease of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of performing phlebotomy on these is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and raise his tongue, and observe under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to press your hand while phlebotomizing these, because below these are arteries.
And your veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which are found in all men, and their phlebotomy is performed in two ways, either by using a lancet or an olive-shaped fleam with a fine point; or by cutting with a fleam knife, and this is called scarification, and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this fleam is of lesser width and a more subtle point, and is suitable for phlebotomy of subtle veins that contain thin, citrine blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: because it draws blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from those that affect the feet and abdomen.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on this vein, that he carefully guard it and be very cautious, for beneath it lies an artery, and if he errs and is imprecise in the puncture with the fleam, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood; therefore, it is necessary that he not perform phlebotomy on this vein with a sharp fleam, before it is incised with a lancet.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary that you leave it and that you move to another, or that you seek one of its branches; or that you perform phlebotomy at the end of the arm, for that is manifest; and incise it with a lancet-fleam as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before binding the arm, touch the area until you know the location of the pulse, and then mark it with ink; and then bind the arm and incise the vein with a concave incision with a lancet-fleam as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall into the area of the artery.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place you have marked with ink, then that inflation is inflation of the artery, and therefore avoid that place.
And if you see the blood flowing from the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is blood from the artery; and then you should watch and place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood is severed, for many times it is severed, then you should tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch the patient for his mucus, and be attentive to him and do not anger him for some days until he is healed.
But if the blood is not severed, and you see that you do not have the medicine present for that, then you should incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the blood is severed; or that you take bark of a fig tree, and pulverize it, and take one half and apply that to the vein with descending ligature and with powders until the next day.
And then if the blood is severed, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which is preceded in the remembrance of the place of the powders that sever the flow of blood.
And the severing of his blood is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But of the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful that extracts the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist that there be great care in his phlebotomy, for beneath it is a nerve; and then if he errs in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, there will happen to him stupor, and its healing is difficult, and perhaps it is never healed at all. And this nerve often appears to the feeling; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you use the phlebotomy instrument with which you perform phlebotomy with a skillful incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases.
And it is fitting in this case, if you wish that the phlebotomist puncture with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument; because it is the safest of all veins, for neither artery nor nerve lies beneath it.
However, it is very quickly inflamed in some men, when it is not phlebotomized at the first percussion, but that inflammation harms nothing.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for the hope of it and caution against the onset of diseases, and that phlebotomy should be done in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median cubital, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtimes, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be done on the third day or on the first, after three hours have passed from the day.
But phlebotomy, which is administered, is more so when it provokes suitability and necessity for it, either by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child not be phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and old women who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wishes to be phlebotomized in any way, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before phlebotomy with a cleansing enema, if they have much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities into the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are impure, and that they do not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with persistent nausea and diarrhea be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or fever until this is resolved in them, nor those suffering from dropsy.  Furthermore, phlebotomy should be avoided near colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive sexual activity, strenuous labor, excessive exercise, fasting, vigils, and any cause that weakens the body's vital strength, whether corporeal or animal.
And consider carefully the thinning of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick, with food and drink, and with medicine if this is possible for them.
And then let them enter a bath, if no cause forbids it, or let them be exercised by some activity so that the blood is thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy on them in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are guarded on that day from all harmful accidents, both animal, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and corporal, such as strenuous labor, excessive exertion, sexual intercourse, and similar things.
And at their bedside, let there be present things whose use is customary among men, things with aromatic qualities and fragrance, and balsams and similar things, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, extend their arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with their hand two or three times; then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not equal, or if the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the blood from flowing properly.
Then, near the constriction, the one who is to be phlebotomized should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then the phlebotomist should lubricate their phlebotomy tool with a little old oil; and then place the index finger of their left hand on the vein, below the spot where they intend to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly, and the percussion is stopped, because those veins that are found like a fleeing string should be avoided in phlebotomy; those that are full of wind and contract under the phlebotomy tool when you place it should be avoided by the phlebotomist; and if the phlebotomy tool does not open the vein, and if it opens, it is narrow.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be careful and attentive to all these matters.
Then apply the phlebotomy tool; but if the vein is opened on the first attempt, it is good; if not, repeat the procedure a little below that spot, or above it gently, if the area is not abscessed.
And if the area is abscessed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will quickly draw hot pus, nor should they enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that you will not obtain the desired quantity of blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in that same spot, carefully and precisely enlarging the opening slightly, and do this gently before the area becomes abscessed, because in many men the area becomes abscessed with a very small opening.
But if you see that it is already abscessed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for there is no reason; and apply some olive oil to that spot, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer olive oil in all phlebotomies with which you bleed the veins to prevent blood clotting, and this is done by theriac and by *sagzenea* (a likely misspelling or variation of a term for a medicinal substance) when one of these is applied to the area, because the blood is thinned and thickened when it is thick.
And if a large abscess develops at the site of the phlebotomy—which happens many times, especially in someone who has been bled only once or where the vein opening was small—then wait, and apply to the area a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water, and compress it for an hour, for it will dissolve [the abscess].
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein, supplementing it or another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains at the site for some days, it is not harmful; and if you wish, apply something made of dissolved aloes and myrrh, or something made of juice of mint or calamint or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings often occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Then place your hand on it, and if you then find softness under your pressure on it, then that swelling is evil and bad; and then be careful that you apply something of what we have said, for blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the place is hardened, and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract blood from every man according to the quantity of his strength and according to the color prevailing over the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong and needs bloodletting, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in someone who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract blood in several times, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best method for phlebotomy is that the incision be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safer from blood flow and nerve incision, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to width and length.
And to the one to whom syncope is accustomed to happen because of phlebotomy, it is necessary that you treat him before phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or warm simple oxymel; and extract the blood from him in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in an aromatic and very fragrant syrup.
And if syncope happens because of phlebotomy, and the cause of it is the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with rue, and let his feet be bound with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope by evacuation.
And whoever wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is for much evacuation and whose strength is weak, that he evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to the quantity of strength in continuous days.
But whoever wants to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do this after seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body contrary to the part to which it inclines, it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and it is sharp and causes fever, it is necessary that blood be drawn from it at once, and a great quantity be drawn from it, and the opening be enlarged until syncope occurs, provided that you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse below the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary, when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, that the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of blood is made difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and that the arm be bent slightly, for this is very bad.
Having left it until it is bled a second time; or remove this with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument which is coagulated blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac, or dried sage, and compress it with a light compression until the blood has come out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is settled.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed him in that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those [veins].
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient immerses his hand in warm water until the vein reddens and appears manifestly.
Then it should be constricted there with a bandage with moderate tightness; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal, neither latitudinally nor longitudinally.
And let the incision be wide, and perform your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize that [vein] a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then you immerse the hand again in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and the same applies to placing the blood vessel in warm water in winter.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than of all other veins, because beneath it there is neither a pulsating vein nor nerves.
And phlebotomy of the vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy is that you constrict the hand with a ligature or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you incise it completely, that will not harm in any way.
And be careful not to extend your incision too far with the phlebotomy, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the necessary amount, then you place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly closed; and similarly you should do in every narrow vein.
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And perform the phlebotomy on him similarly as you have done on the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine illnesses, and menstrual retention, and for illnesses of old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is that the patient puts his foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins are clearly visible; and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein appears  at the ankle, above the aforementioned bone, and from it many branches are spread on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg, near the ankle, near the joint, for it is better and healthier.
And if you phlebotomize that on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy in such a way that you phlebotomize across, almost as if you wanted to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the outflow of blood is prohibited; then immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the area is safe; and do not fear harming him, but be wary of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot.
And of the sciatic vein, the location as we have said is below the heel, under the ankle bone of the left side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of his phlebotomy is that the patient enter a bath, and quickly and tightly bind his thigh from the hip to above the ankle above four fingers with a long, thin bandage, because it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize that according to whichever method is possible for you and according to the transverse; and it is better; or incise it by incision or cut it by section, because its location is safe.
And it is in many men very hidden; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the inside of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood flow that you wish.
Then loosen the binding and place cotton over the site of the phlebotomy and bind the place tightly, because it heals easily.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping instruments are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping that is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping instruments which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are applied to fourteen places on the body, of which one place where cupping instruments are placed is called alnocrati, and it is the hinder part of the head; and the middle of it on two parts of the neck together; and cupping instruments on the chin under the jaw below the mouth; and cupping instruments on two shoulder blades; and cupping instruments on the loins, and it is above the end of the hipbone; and cupping instruments on two flanks, and they are on two sides; and cupping instruments on two thighs; and cupping instruments on two buttocks.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the strength by it, as is the case with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping for an illness or for a continued [illness], let us administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it and at any time whatsoever.
Therefore, when one sees any of these symptoms, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we order cupping to be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied, it relieves the heaviness in the head and that which is affecting the eyes; but this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advisable to use it on someone of cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And therefore, it is not advisable to use this on the elderly, and on those whose heads suffer from cold illnesses.
But to one on whom this is being continuously applied, forgetfulness ensues; and therefore you should instruct the cupper to place his hand lightly with the cupping glass over the parts below, to prevent the onset of forgetfulness.
But cupping with alcohol is in the place of phlebotomy of the dark vein (vena fusca) and the basilic vein: and therefore it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the throat, and the splitting of the throat's cartilage, and coughs, and congestion.
And the alcoholic cupping glass should be slightly elevated, for if it is placed too low, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* (a likely medicinal substance, the exact nature of which is unknown without further context) benefits accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarification, lest he cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar oral diseases; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the *aliheric* (likely a specific vein, the precise location of which is unclear without further context) which is in the two lips.
But cupping done over the two shoulder blades benefits *caphatan* (a likely ailment or symptom, again the exact nature requires more context), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two inner parts of the ankles benefits in the same way as phlebotomy of three veins, that is, the basilic, median cubital (fusca - meaning dark in color, a possible reference to its location or appearance), and cephalic veins; because it draws the blood from all those smaller veins which are in the flesh, and those smaller veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed excessively with scarification, because the place is devoid of flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass with which one cups over the buttocks, and it benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that it should be a large cupping glass, and that it should be of brass, because the place requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses are easily broken, and it should be scarified with scarification.
Moreover, cupping of the legs benefits greatly through manifest depletion, because it draws blood from the whole body, and it benefits old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and benefits swellings and inflammations; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two jugular veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause fainting in many men.
And of the jugular cupping, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw by moderate suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors come to the place by equal admixture. And do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the area redden and swell and the redness of blood appears.
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and consider the condition of the body.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare strength, it is fitting that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to enlarge the scarification a little, and moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened for the blood and its watery parts. But in the second [scarification], to the thorough examination acquired by the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that it achieves the desired effect.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the term "scarification" refers to the depth of the incision only.
And if the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, the places for cupping should be anointed with lenitive, opening, and resolving ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and cold, then let the oil be amaranth oil, or balm oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be avoided, and for such patients the areas for cupping should be washed with vinegar or cold water of nightshade, or poppy water, or Bordeaux water, and similar things.
And the one whose blood is of much humidity, wash their cupping areas with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for one whose superfluities are thick, wash their cupping areas with old wine, or with  self-heal water (or possibly a majorana plant), or with a decoction of anise, or chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before a bath;  it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and the patient should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that ought to be regulated for the patient undergoing cupping or phlebotomy before cupping?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning: if the one being cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp blood and inflammation, then they should take cooling substances, such as sour pomegranates, and endive in sour wine and lettuce, and succory, and julep, and similar things.
And give them foods such as poultry, and the meat of domesticated birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and the like.
And for one whose complexion is cold, they should drink syrup of dates, or syrup of succory seeds, and sumac, and wine that is moderately sweet between old and new; and it should be recommended to them that they use moderation in drinking and eating, and give them foods such as poultry, hempseed, peas, small birds, and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and phlebotomy, their drink be greater than their food.
And it is necessary that at certain hours, some men be given theriaca alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or theriac before cupping or before phlebotomy or soon after, so that the principal members are comforted and the blood is thinned; and they should not take it warm.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be applied to the liver, and over the spleen and gout, and over the navel, in the areas of the knees, and the hip joint, because these members do not tolerate scarification.
And it is not desired for these, but rather the attraction of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of a nasal hemorrhage; and we use this so that cold, invisible windiness is dissolved from the member, just as we place it on the belly and navel; for this rarefies the member and warms it and diminishes the pain because it resolves windiness.
And it is placed on boils when they occur with obstruction or swelling, because by the virtue of strong attraction it easily opens the obstruction and removes the swelling from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of windiness enclosed within them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of tepid water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, with hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Method of applying a cupping glass with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and let the length of the cup be half a palm; and let it be on the side of the patient, in the place that is in the circumference, half of it, the hole should be small, enough for a needle to enter it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or tin, with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb because of its position on it.
And let there be a transverse bar of bronze or iron in the middle of it, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And now let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illness and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and emaciated individuals are different from the cupping glasses for youths and those of robust builds.
And the manner of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the wick with a decent wood fire before a small wax candle, and place it on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the lower part so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then let it be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger on the hole we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and let the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be detached.
And then ignite the wick according to its nature, and repeat if you need to.
But in cupping, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb only.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leech applications are not administered to all members, but only to those members where the application of cupping glasses is not possible because of their smallness, such as the finger and gum and similar; or to a member devoid of flesh, such as a finger and nose and their like.
And the quality of using those is that you should find leeches in clean, fresh waters of a stagnant pool.
And then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no substance remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated beforehand with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the member of the patient until it reddens; and then let them be applied to it.
And when they are full, remove them.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the application of the leeches, and it oozes, then you dip a cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the oozing stops.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle on it crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, until the bleeding stops; or place halves of roasted beans on the area, and leave them until the beans adhere to the place, and the bleeding stops.
And it is necessary, if needed, to iterate the leeches, when it is possible to change them.
And if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood comes out; and then apply them, for when they sense any blood they immediately attach.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them a little crushed aloe, or salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: Of Restoration. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish physicians and the common people boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them.
And for this reason, this skill of the learned in our land is kept private; and I have never forgotten this at any time; and I have not acquired this knowledge except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study of their understanding, until I extracted their science.
And then I added to it experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and upon which my experience is based; since I have shortened it for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have shortened it to the point of brevity; and I have shown it to the point of clarity; and I have included in it many forms of instruments that are administered in this, as is done by the addition of explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summary and collections concerning bone fractures, of those things which it is necessary to preface before we begin the discussion of broken limbs and the various [types] of each. Therefore, I will say in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters on the understanding of which the artisan is initially obliged to stand upon the truth of those things; that is, you and those who are ready to know or learn this noble art, others besides you.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, then you should initially treat it with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness of constitution, or if the one to whom it happened is a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.
And then let him be content with a diet of cold herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and we forbid rich meats and overfilling oneself with food and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure of avoiding a hot abscess, and if you do not fear effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to his former regime with which he is accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nutritious foods, very thick and heavy foods in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads [presumably of grain], and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar things, and with this regime, coagulation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their first youth and in the decrepit, cannot be joined and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and applies to the broken bone from every side some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until they are completely conjoined and bound together, until they reach the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until nothing prevents it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient foods in which there is weight, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, because a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another.
And I come to the recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter distinct from the others.
Many diversities of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arcuate fracture, another that happens in splinters; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions proceeding and not proceeding, as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is fracture with a wound and disruption at the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type belongs a proper instrument or torment in its restoration, as will come its recollection distinct in its places.
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is known: its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and that of it when we compress it with one's hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is it made by your touching when you touch the bone with agitation and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Perhaps there is a crookedness or small fissure, therefore you should not move it with your hand and with complete compression; rather place on it the medicines of which you have recollection appropriate for this moment which suits the place; and it should be held tight by a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is arched and is not split in two, or another thing that does not happen to it suddenly, as if the whole part is moved from its comparison, then you must begin at once to rectify it before an abscess happens to it.
And if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days until the abscess ceases; and then dress it according to any manner that you can of lightness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a sudden injury has occurred.
And then tighten it as the recollection of it comes.
But if there is a sudden injury in the bone, then extension of that broken member from two parts is necessary, if it is the hand or foot; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords or with one cord and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the injured limb in a splint according to its natural shape; while the broken parts of the limb are being extended, then it is necessary that you return those additions with ingenuity and in any way that you can to their places.
And be careful, according to your strength, that no pain or injury comes to the patient from your operation; and endeavor, according to your ability, that you apply one bone to the other, its partner, according to their best shapes.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch that with your hand, and if you see there some different cause, rectify that and adjust it to the extent of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who many times cause a hot abscess by their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen this happen through their operation many times.
And the quality of the binding of the calmed limb is that which I recommend; so that you may know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their greatness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the wrist and similar to them, then it is necessary that the bandage be of very fine soft cloth.
But those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that for them there be a wide and firm bandage, for the wide binding connects the large limb and binds it on all sides with even pressure, so that no blemish enters it.
And then begin, after your equal evacuation, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of the fracture with three or four layers depending on what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the uppermost part of the place of the fracture, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you bound the place of the fracture. And then extend yourself with the bandage from the place of the fracture a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you reach from the place a large part.
And then take another bandage and wrap that other time over the broken place with a bandage, and then come with the bandages to the lowermost part of the fracture; and let your action in the tightening of the bandage and in the softening of it be as we have said in the first bandage above.
And then place between the layers of bandage linen or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, place nothing there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then place over these bandages properly made splints immediately, if in the place there is no inflammation or hot abscess, and then place over it that which dries the abscess and removes the inflammation; and leave that for some days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be of half a smoothed, shaved cane, and well and wisely formed; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be thicker and a little smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is suitable for the limb in size; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with thread decently as we have said of tightening, and that is that your tightening should be greater at the place of the fracture, and the more it is removed from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and thinness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some fools placing their threads of twisted rope, and it is a great error, when the tightening lacks equality.
And likewise, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with those what you want by tightening, and it is not necessary that there be less than one finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place underneath those some carded flax or wool until it no longer causes injury to them.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the bone, and I will come to a recollection of that in the following chapter according to its particularity.
And know that not every broken limb is bound with splints on the first day; the reason is that, when the limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints on it until about five days or seven or more, according to your certainty of the occurrence of a hot abscess.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients made restorations; these were placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Method of a common plaster, briefly described, for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many constitutions and especially for women and children, because it is of a substance that does not retain heat nor cold: it is that you take some miller's dust, which is the fine flour powder that settles on the walls of the mill from the action of the millstones.
And prepare it in this way, except that you sift it with egg white, and make the composition neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of a plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and of wild pomegranate root, of each one drachm; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms; of aloes wood, twenty drachms; all should be crushed and sifted and mixed with  aloechil water or with egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores slightly broken bones, and it suits many people.
Another method of a plaster which is suitable for fractures and sprains: take wild pomegranate root and marshmallow root, ten drachms each; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms each; of acacia, six drachms; of Armenian bole, twenty drachms.
All should be crushed in a mortar with great care, and sifted, and mixed with water or with egg white and applied.
A method for a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: let greasy wool be taken and submerged in sour wine and boiled oil and placed on the area.
But in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it draws out hot abscesses and expels pain effectively.
Another method of a plaster that mends a broken bone: take leaves of the wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; pound everything and make a plaster from them.
A concise method for a plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers, barley flour, of each an equal part; let them all be crushed and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix it with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method for a plaster more powerful in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of each an equal part; let all be crushed and mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration, but rather a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be of medium thickness.
But in Gaul it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the ingredients which are drying with a little heat, such as myrrh, incense, and similar to those things that we have mentioned.
Method for a plaster that relieves injury and pain: take millet, linseed, shaved human hair or bird down, and marshmallow, and salt, equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and mixed, and a plaster made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and when it should be loosened is that you consider whether no pain or itching has occurred and the bone is not broken or dislodged; then you do not loosen it for many days. And if vehement pain, itching, or inflammation occurs at the site, then immediately loosen or unbind it, and remove the plaster.
And take linen cloth and a damp sea sponge, and submerge it in lukewarm water, and with that wash the area until the itching ceases and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place over it soiled wool soaked in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it over for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb has subsided, and its pain is calmed.
And then repeat that subtle binding and small plaster and do not tighten it as much as with your first constriction, but make it subtle until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, the redness, the pain, the inflammation, and all the symptoms have subsided completely, and you need a plaster and binding, then repeat it as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you upon the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
And then adjust the binding more than in your first binding, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, according to the previous recollection of it.
But if you see the fracture site drying and thinning more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you unbind it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the binding a little, and by this operation nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not set correctly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their procedure, and a great danger; and if it were straight, the Ancients enlarged upon this in their books and worked with this.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable that you do not do this.
Chapter Two: Of fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are made by the blow of a sword, and the blow crushes all the bone into the ciphac (possibly referring to the cancellous bone), which is beneath the bone, just as it does in the shaft, and for this reason this type is called ascial (possibly meaning 'axial'); or the sword cuts some part of the bone, and it cuts the flesh and does not pass the cut to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called levatio absoluta (possibly meaning 'complete elevation' or 'complete separation').
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small, and of fracture which is contusio (contusion) or atricio (attrition); and its cause is a blow with a blunt object or a fall on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, which approaches the panniculus (tissue layer) which is beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as small as a hair's breadth, and for that reason this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture that is made either by a fall or by a blow with a stone and the like, which causes some lamina (thin layer) of the bone to enter into the inner parts, and is made in a concave place, just as it happens to the edges of a helmet when it receives a blow and a part of it is driven inwards.
And this happens mostly in the bodies of moist bones, such as the heads of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will return everything to its place with re-alignment (or repositioning).
And we recognize all these types of fractures by palpation of them and by investigation with probes and removal of corrupted flesh that is over them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is uncovered on the bone, and is wiped clean, and then examined with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms. Then, if you see symptoms that clearly signify danger, such as vomiting of bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, and swelling and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms in greater intensity, without a doubt it is not healing.
And if you see no unusual symptoms and you expect recovery, then you begin his treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person has come to you at the beginning of the injury, and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you study the setting of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all the circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then you should strive to set the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone is corrupted by the panniculus (tissue), and before the symptoms that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the panniculus covering the brain, and is with small splintered parts and attrition, then it is necessary to incise the comminuted and atrophied part, as I shall explain to you.
And so you shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as possible according to the shape of the wound, and that it be light on the patient.
And if you encounter, during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary.  That is, you fill the place with cloths infused in wine and rose oil, and allow the wound to rest until the abscess is settled, and you are sure of the flow of blood; and then begin the encircling of the bone and its removal.
And this should be according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its form:  And then use another incisor, this one a little wider than that one; and this is its form:
And then use even wider incisors than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a number of different incisors, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others, and let them be sharp at the ends, and be of Indian iron or steel.
And use them with ease in percussion on the incisor so that you do not hit the head and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you use the incisors with the drills, which are called shallow drills.
And they are not called so except because those do not reach the limit of the skull bone that is near it, because the drill has a round end or edge below its sharp head, similar to a small edge or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each of which suits the thickness of each bone, until you have present in all parts of the skull a drill whose end is sharp, the length and shortness of which is according to the thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the form of three types of drills: The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; and then move the drill to another place, and place them so that the space between each hole is the size of the width of a finger or thereabouts.
And then incise with incisors that which is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can in order to lighten it, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument that you have prepared for this, such as fine pincers and forceps.
And you must take great care that the incisor does not touch any part of the brain.
And so, when you have encircled the bone by perforating it, and it is separated from the brain if it is connected to it, and you have extracted it, you must scrape and smooth its roughness with an instrument similar to an incisor, but it should be finer and more delicate than the other incisors.
And if any small and jagged bone fragments remain, then remove them easily with whatever instruments you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments which we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is easier and less frightening, which Galen and Avicenna praised highly; and this is his description: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin by uncovering the part of the bone at the location where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and have placed beneath it the end of that slow and gentle incisor of which this is the form:
And it is such that the lenticular part is broad and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided into two edges lengthwise, as you see; so that the lenticular part is applied to the brain with its face, the sharp edge cutting into the bone.
And then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until you cut through all the bone easily as it is rotated, and you are sure that the panniculus (tissue layer) will not suffer any damage that you fear in any way; and even if the medicant were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, even if he were asleep.
Then, if any material attached to the bone remains in the panniculus in some places of the bone, cut it away with the lenticular end of that incisor, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the panniculus, and that which is separated or removed from the bone is its surface, and there remain roughness and small splinters, then it is necessary to smooth away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, for which you have prepared a number of different sizes so that you can use those that are most suitable and most appropriate to the place, according to how you proceed with your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And you must proceed in your rasping of the bone, beginning with the broadest of those rasps, and then gradually use the finer ones, and do not cease to do this continuously until you come to use the finest and most subtle of all those rasps.
But in all other small, hairline fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer care according to how you proceed with their rectification.
And this is a matter that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And I stand by what we have written and shown regarding large fractures.
And if the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) is retracted when you rasp the bone, then you must take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and submerge it in wine and rose oil and place this over the thin cloth, doing this as lightly as possible so as not to burden the scalp; and then apply a broad bandage over this, and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds the wound only.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of a hot abscess; and then untie it and apply medicines that counteract excessive dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour,  powdered chickpea and birthwort, and similar things.
And it is necessary that you make a powder of these medicines to be sprinkled on the wound, once they are dry; and universally, apply any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite (i.e., cause further damage).
And take care, according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and that there is no pus or anything else; and do not allow virulence to accumulate in it; for when it is applied to the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) of the brain, it corrupts it and festers it, and this malignant evil quickly affects the patient.
And it happens in the scalp, as the bone is cleaned, especially when its treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if the patient suffers the consequences we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly pernicious.
And if the blackness is not caused by the medicine applied, but is due to the medicine itself causing that blackness, then you should take one part honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these anoint a cloth, and then place that on the scalp; and then treat it with appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in its two upper parts together, or one of those sometimes, because it has two bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and is not broken and suffers only abrasion, twisting and sinuosity.
But if one of the two parts of it is broken, then you must insert your little finger into his nose, and you should manipulate that fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and take care that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be set with the end of a thin rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same thing.
And aim to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should apply the remedy for the inflamed wound.
And then insert into the end of the nose a small roll of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or two small wedges, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the wedge be of such a size that it fills the opening in the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the wedges should be soaked in a solution, and changed every day, but I have not seen this; rather, it is necessary that the roll be soaked in egg white mixed with powdered barley; and then leave the wedge in until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a wedge, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, may be inserted into the nose; and this is appropriate if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, make wedges.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, apply a plaster to the nose with cerate or cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then you should plaster that area externally with sesame flour and cooked lentil powder mixed with egg white; and then place linen over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary to make an incision over them and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then close the incision and treat it with things that promote healing and consolidation, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with wedges and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Of the restoration of the mandible when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two and is bent inwards at the broken parts, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and push with it the hump of the fracture inwards, easily towards the outside parts, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thus properly setting it.
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides according to straightness until its alignment is possible.
And if there is concussion of teeth with disruption, then bind those which you expect will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place over the fractured mandible a cerate, and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a well-made large compress, or a piece of linen equal to the length of the mandible; and then bind that over it according to how the bandage is prepared for you and how the application suits, until it is healed.
And command the patient to use rest and quiet, and give him food of sorbitive lions.  (Note: "sorbitive lions" is likely a mistranslation or archaic term; it probably refers to a type of easily digestible food.)
And if you estimate that the figure is already altered in some manner, then you should examine it and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify what is already altered and plaster it with powdered lily, with egg white, or with starch, after you have removed the cerate, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and adjusted, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it; do not unbind it until it is healed and strengthens the fracture; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and the abscess is softened.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for that in the removal of those from the instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam according to your necessity.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for it and heal that, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture is done in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is so that splinters occur in it, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the aid and aligns the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither little prominence nor concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the armpit of the patient a roll of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to the amount of your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the roll with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle to the outer parts, because it has reached the acromion, then the patient should be supine on his neck, and place a moderately sized cushion on his muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle which is on the acromion above is elevated, and then you rectify the fracture and align it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are bad, then you should make an incision over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you make an incision with one of the scalpels which you have prepared for this, after having placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves as a support; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size or smallness of the bone.
But its length should be as long as is possible for you in the operation; that it has two ends like this, and one end is wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you join the two lips of the wound with suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And ensure that the tablet is not moved from over the broken bone; and for this reason it is necessary that you see the patient each day, so that when the ligament is softened, or you see that the tablet has been moved, then you rectify this and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion under their testicle at night on top of their pillow; so that with this the support of the limb is elevated, and thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by the muscle; or let their arm be tied to their neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless an abscess or swelling occurs at the site, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you have seen its surface adhere to it, and adjust the constriction and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle is restored and coagulated.
And it is strengthened and healed, according to the measure, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder.
The shoulder blade is broken at its lateral side, and not broken through, but only at the edges.
And so when the place of it is broken — and it is broken in the middle of that place — and is not known except by touch, then, according to what the figure of the fracture is, force the preparation of it and reduce it according to its natural figure in every way that is possible for you.
Then place on the area a powder made from finely ground egg white and lion's wool; then place a dusting of doubled cloth; then place over it a thin linen bandage, according to the size of the entire shoulder blade or a little more.
But if under the bandage there is a concavity in any part of the shoulder blade, then you should fill that concavity with lion's wool, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
Then bind it above with a long bandage with decent constriction and firmness of the bandage until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage each day; and every time that it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and adjust the bandage if it has moved from its place.
And have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And then when this number is complete, then you unbind the bandage, and you should know for certain that this is from the bones of which neither the beginning nor the dissolution is feared.
And if it proceeds from the location of the hip bone and extends below the groin, then you incise over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle for the treatment of a hot abscess if it occurs here.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in its middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster because they are more compact and less fragmented.
And among the accidents of a broken mid-foot is that it inclines inwards, causing great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, strong fever, and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from sensation.
And its restoration is that the patient should be laid supine on his back, with a cushion placed between his shoulders; and then press on his muscles, and align his bones with hands on both sides, and be meticulous in the operation and adjustment in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone's shape is restored as it should be.
Then apply a plaster and lint, and over that place a splint made of thin willow or hazel wood, or similar light materials, wrapping it in cloth; and be careful in binding it over the broken bone so that it is not moved; and bind it in a circular fashion around the foot sometimes, and tighten it with a suitable constriction; and check the bandage frequently, and tighten it whenever it becomes loose.
And if necessity dictates loosening the bandage because of corrosion, itching, pain, or an abscess forming in the area, then carefully unbind it, remove the plaster, and rectify the problem with appropriate treatment; and then reapply the plaster, if it seems appropriate; and adjust the binding until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the restoration of ribs when they are fractured.
Know that a fracture of the ribs only occurs in the thicker parts, that is to say, in the two [middle] sections; and in their extremities, on the front part, a break does not occur, except for the fact that they are cartilaginous. And its diagnosis is not hidden from the senses, but is discovered by questioning the patient.
And the restoration should be such that you align the fracture with your hands, as much as possible, until it is aligned as it should be; and then apply a plaster and bandage the broken bone tightly, if that is needed.
And if the rib fracture is inclined towards the inner parts, then the patient experiences vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in someone with pleurisy, and this is because the bone pierces the membrane; and the patient experiences difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting a lot of blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the Ancients devised many ingenious things for this.
And of them it is said: it is necessary to give the patient foods that cause inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we should avoid this so that it does not easily cause a hot abscess, if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then it helps with that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw with force; and this seems reasonable, but it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is equal when it envelops that roundness; and then the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if a violent cause constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pierces the membrane with a sharp puncture, threatening the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area, uncover the broken rib, and then place on top of it an instrument that preserves the ciphac (presumably a type of bandage or splint), the preparation of which has been previously described, and that we incise the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we should bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs internally, then you should take and dip powders in rose oil and place them on the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him lie supine on the side on which he sleeps until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and then attrition follows, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider: for if you see his hands already softened and stupefied and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor clench them, and when you constrain them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most dispositions, it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction in them with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if the same thing is seen in the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, that which happened in the hands happens to them, and also when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he lies supine on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not labor in his cure.
But if none of these things happen, the condition is better and milder.
And the cure for him is that you should strive for the sedation of the hot abscess, that you place on the affected or rubbed vertebra plain olive oil, or with beaten egg whites; place this on it several times a day until the hot abscess is sedated.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it on with a bandage; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if there is a separation of the bone from the affected area or any part that has already separated from it, then it is necessary that you make an incision over the bone and remove that bone; and then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment, until it is healed.
But if the back of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the tailbone, then you must insert the little finger of your left hand into the anus, and reposition the broken bone with your other hand as much as possible by second intention; and then apply a plaster and splint, if you need them, and then bind it.
And if you feel broken fragments there, then you should open it up, remove them, and treat the wound with the treatment described above until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the restoration of the hip.
Hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are, the fracture is only a separation at their extremities and they are split lengthwise and lean inwards;  and the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is its shape.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you align that according to what is suitable for you by equal alignment until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or leans downwards, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared by you. And then, when you have aligned it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or reed over that, and bind it tightly so that you do not fear a puncture of the fracture or movement of the splint.
And fill the cavity with something that will fill it until it takes the binding equally, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place on it that which settles it as has been described before; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if it happens that the bones are pierced or comminuted, then you extract them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured joint.
The joint is that which is between the ribs and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden stick of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at its two extremities, and then let it be suspended from a raised location.
And seat the patient on a stool; and then place his broken arm over the stick until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which the curve of the stick should be attached.
And then suspend some heavy object from it, or let the assistant pull it downwards; and then let the physician hold the fracture together with his hands, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
And the other method is that the patient lies supine on his back, and suspend his arm from his neck with a bandage; and then command two assistants that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold the part below; and each of them pull in his direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you bind above the fracture with a bandage, and above that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants pulls in their respective directions.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the armpit and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that location and over that elbow.
Swathe that with ease and without trouble, and then when it is swathed as necessary and is applied with a good application, then bind it tightly unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day, and place on it clean wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you bind it.
And the manner of binding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand over its muscle.
And place the cloth and bind the arm to the support so that the arm is in a steady position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is necessary to place over the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the break with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then bind over the splints with the bandage which I described at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is necessary that your bandage over the place of the fracture be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you proceed.
And if you fear a hot abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then examine the bandage in all parts for three days, so that no itching or inflammation occurs at the site; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the tightness of the bandage; and so rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of these things will occur, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleeping position be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place on the splint a poultice full of well-carded wool, and check every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is not softened; then rectify it all with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously given, so that the food is light at the beginning until the tightening (of the injury/bandage) begins; and then it is fitting that you increase his food.
Because it is customary for the splint and his leg to be bound for forty days; and then it is necessary that they be unbound and a bath be administered and it be medicated with ointments which rectify that (injury).
And if the fracture is badly comminuted (shattered), then you should not unbind the bandage and splints until 10 days or until two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils (forearm bones); of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and it is that which is placed below the little finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger focil (radius) is broken alone, or the smaller one (ulna), and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focil (ulna) is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is quicker.
And when the focil (ulna) is broken below, then the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the broken bone is the smaller focil (ulna) above, then it is convenient for the physician, during its restoration, to apply gentle extension easily until it is aligned.
But if the large focil (radius) is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply more forceful extension.
And if both focils (radius and ulna) are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And you must position the hand during its restoration and extension stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a level surface.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer discomfort.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should manipulate the bone until he reduces it to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then you must forcefully reduce all the pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated splinter appears that protrudes and you have no hope of restoring it, then you should cut it off and remove it according to the method that we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dedicated a special chapter to this, and therefore take care of that.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then you should apply a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil and white wax, of moderate consistency, neither too thick nor too thin, and bind the cloth tightly over it until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate and apply a plaster prepared from pulverized mollusk shell with egg white, and then apply a splint; and the splint that is placed over the fracture should be as long and strong as possible.
And know that the number of splints for the arm varies depending on the major conditions, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your binding over the fracture site as firmly and tightly as possible, and if the binding is applied to the parts above the fracture or to the parts below it, apply the binding a little more loosely, as was mentioned earlier at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist cloths, not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is bound should be of moderate thickness, neither too thin nor too thick, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any complication arises requiring correction, such as itching that affects the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the fracture is already softened and the bone is reset and appears similar to the others, then correct all this with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage, for then you must loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient experiences none of the complications we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
Then the patient's hand should be suspended by its own active movement, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or very quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the strength of the patient.
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the wrist and finger joints; attrition is more common.
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down and a cushion should be placed in front of him for support, and then place his hand on that cushion.
Then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they are properly joined.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless an abscess is present; and then place a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with his injured hand; then it should be firmly bound with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a bandage on top and another bandage on the underside of the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, as if the hand were held straight between the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as needed and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, place a small, straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or in the index finger, or in the ring finger, or in the little finger, then it should be bandaged and tied to the finger next to it; or all should be tied together continuously, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and near it, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose—with your operation—what is necessary when any of these things occur, according to the repeated narration of the case.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is felt according to whether it is broken in the front or the back part.
And its restoration is done in this way: a ligament is tightened above the fracture and another below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then the physician extends the entire ligament to its proper place, according to the nature of the fracture, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then let the ligament be close to the knee on the hamstring side, so that the extension is upwards, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the ligament be placed near the knee, and let the extension be towards the lower parts.
Then the physician aligns the bone with both hands until it is reduced to its natural shape and the bone is joined by a good joint; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs, then you leave it for some days until the abscess has matured and subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made as follows:  Wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long strip of cloth between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower side, with the ends of the cloth coming from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh that which is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the location of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths so that the bandage is firm.
Then begin with a tight bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and as you move further away from the fracture site, make your bandage looser, lighter, and softer.
Then extend the two ends of the cloth to the lower parts until they reach the ankle, and tie both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not dislodged from its place.
Then leave the bandage on, ensuring that it does not cause corrosion, hot abscess, swelling, or similar problems to the limb; and if any of these problems occur, then carefully loosen it, and correct what has happened, as we have said many times before.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding from the bone, then you must set it as well as possible; and if not, cover it and secure it, and treat it with what has been mentioned previously until it is healed.
And sometimes this thigh fracture is tightened beyond the application of splints, as we have described in the aid to the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this manner, the patient does not experience limping; and if it is restored alone, without the other leg being used as support, then it is necessary that he limp on the affected leg permanently.
And know that the thigh is held tightly for forty days or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions (of the patient).
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but very often attrition (or wearing away) occurs.
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with a wound or without a wound, and above all, it is accompanied by pain.
And its restoration is thus: that which is broken of its parts should be aligned with said splints until it is reunited and joined as much as possible by equalization and ease and fabrication (or construction/setting).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you have one; and bind it above with a bandage suitable for this.
And then consider all the precautions which we have recommended in other fractures, such as a hot poultice and similar things, so that every accident is opposed with what is convenient for him until he is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large and is called by the name of the leg; and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
And the same types of fractures occur to each of these bones of the leg as occur to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one and the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is deformed in all its parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is deformed in the front part.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find that below, and it is one of those causes which are not easily noticed by you.
Then administer extension, setting, and bandaging of the splints according to that same method.
However, if the leg fracture is large with many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and alleviate it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is some cause for operation similar to the arm, and when you set the splints and complete your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood, which are placed under the bandages which are placed on the soles, and are usually made from palm branches; choose those which are of small thickness, and not at all the thin ones, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the bottom.
Then wrap around each leg two cloths according to their length, and place one on one part of the leg and the other on the other part, and let them extend from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then bind the two splints in three places: at the two ends and in the middle.  For with this structure, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, according to the length of the leg, has been applied; and let the leg be placed on it so that it conserves its position and prevents movement.
And especially it is necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound properly so called.
Then examine the leg each day and study it carefully. Observe it for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar problems; and if any of these occur, then treat it accordingly until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do sometimes occur; and fractures of the toes rarely occur, and only attrition in cases of dislocation.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and those bones are raised up between themselves, then the patient should place his foot on the ground prepared as before.
Then place one foot on that which is raised of those bones, and then press and squeeze those until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and tow over it, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two flat pieces are attached.
Then bind that to the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary materials.
And when three or four days have passed for him, then unbind the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, or whether they are fractured or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some say they are fractured, then restore them and set them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then apply to the fractured finger a splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little longer than it; and place under the foot that board which I have described to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is fractured of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board at the lowest part of the foot, and let it be resting on one of the ends of the board outside the sole of the foot so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you not forget to consider all the causes which I have mentioned to you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have discussed; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of a woman is fractured, then make her lie down in a lying position, and gently incline her to one side, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made into a ball in her hip; and then the woman should be held, and her hip raised little by little, for all this is thrown in until the hip area is like a ball and the fractured bone returns.
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and let her urinate, and reduce and return it according to the manner in which you first set it, and then return to the first powder.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for by then it will be restored.
And if you wish, take a pig's bladder and attach a reed tube to its opening; and insert the whole bladder into her hip, and then blow into the tube gently until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will help the fracture to heal.
And then it should be filled with cotton and left for several days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing what we have recommended for the hip bone.
And what is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures which happen infrequently, especially to one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for that fracture signifies to you the most appropriate methods in its restoration and binding, so understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take goose grease and apply it to the penis; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and let it remain for three days or so, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you treat and bleed him immediately if the conditions for bloodletting indicate it as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then you must attend to stopping it, so that you sprinkle crushed sage on it, if no other remedy is at hand.
And then begin to reset the fracture on that same day, and do not delay, lest an abscess form.
But if a hot abscess forms, then delay resetting it until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for you will cause harmful complications.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered, then you must carefully reduce it and align it with your hands gently and with little extension.
But if extension is not available to you, and the alignment with your hands is insufficient, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length being seven or eight digits, and its width according to the size of the wound; and for this, it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these, according to the amount needed for the treatment of all types of fractures.
And let it be round, and of little thickness, so that it does not bend under compression during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a bevel at its extremities; and let the upper part of it be of gradually increasing thickness, from the middle to the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Because it is necessary that its sharp end be placed raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and is held in place with some equalization/alignment.
And then strive to align the ends of the fracture with each other, and if the broken end of the bone is thin, and does not receive the instrument well, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then incise it with whatever is suitable from the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement and persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to give great relief to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is completed, then immerse a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you may incise the opening with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And take great care not to constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and it has caused death or a corrosive and persistent illness, that is, madness, in their patients. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a bandage of hard cloths instead of stitches and bind it with those.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to suppurate, then remove the cloth which you had placed on it with wine, and then apply balms, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary for you to untie the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and closed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down from it easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not healed nor is the pus removed from it, then know that here are signs of small foreign bodies, for which it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe. And of those foreign bodies, those that are separated, remove and extract them; those which are not separated and which irritate the limb and cause pain, force you to incise them as far as is possible for you.
And if there occurs in the wound swelling or inflammation, that is,  inflammation, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of these with that which is appropriate for it, according to the treatment which has been previously narrated in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should address, and you should take note: when a large bone is fractured, such as the bone of the thigh and similar large limb bones, and there is no pulling or extraction of it, because many times death results from this; rather, leave it until it suppurates, for it will fall off by itself quite quickly, within twenty or thirty days; and then treat the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: On the treatment of a swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of a healing fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply medicines that are styptic, such as aloes, enses (likely a misspelling or archaic term, perhaps referring to a specific plant), myrrh, cerecloth (or a similar binding material), and acacia, and similar things; so that you take some or all of these, and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply this to the swelling on a piece of linen, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage untouched for many days; then unbind it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or apply a lead plate tightly, for lead has the property of reducing anything swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already become hardened and constricted and necessitates its careful removal, then incise it at its most superior part, and cut away the excess and protruding matter, or scrape it with some instrument until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when it is set, and the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is set, and the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes: one of which is excessive loosening of the ligaments and the binding done not as it should be; or by excessive tightness of the bandages such that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or by an excessive amount of superfluous embrocation; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and to cheer their heart so that their blood is increased; and administer baths; and introduce joy and mirth to them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continuous embrocation with warm water, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, in a limb already set, there is a return of crookedness and prominence at the fractured bone and swelling, and because of this a deformity of the limb, but nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the word of someone who thinks that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this practice is very reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which are boiled softening herbs, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and a softening plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be prepared and mixed with white of egg or olive oil, and applied as a plaster; or ripe figs should be crushed with pigeon droppings, and similar things from among the medicines that are called vulnerary consolidants.
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent, gentle rubbing with moist hands, and movement of the limb in every direction should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has already progressed and become strong and hardened, and the need arises to treat it with iron, then the uppermost part should be removed and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells with the bone should be incised with fine scalpels, and relief should be provided for this with care and skill.
Chapter 23.
Concerning speech on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their place, wherefore movement is impeded, and the shape of the limb is distorted, and it brings great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to immediately strive that it be reduced, and not delay that reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and very quickly the reduction of the dislocation becomes difficult.
And for this reason it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and excruciating pains.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and then let it be until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that which will bring it back to its proper place (or function).
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what preceded on fracture; from the uppermost part of the body down to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are dislodged from their places by slight movement, and are softened a little; or they are dislocated by complete and total dislocation, until they are softened at the joint, so that saliva runs from the patient, and he cannot hold it, nor close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled in his speech.
But when his dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then reduction must be administered quickly, and not delayed at all.
And let the assistant hold the patient's head, and let the physician insert the index finger of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or let him insert both index fingers together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands should be outside with which he grasps; and he commands the patient to relax his jaws and release them from either side; and the physician grasps the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And when they return and are grasped, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over that powders of cloth with cerate, and let it be made of wax and oil, mixed; and then let it be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and his head should be between two pillows, so that it does not incline to the right or left; and do not force him to chew anything; before his food should be broth, until when the pains are relieved and the jaws are healed, then let him eat what he wants.
And this should be administered easily, and he should not exert himself in opening his mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and continuous thirst occur, and the patient's abdomen is quickly distended, and he quickly vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and many times he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inward by its connection with the ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is apparent to the touch/feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then constrict the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
Then apply a plaster and powders to that area and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the hip and is continuous with it, is not dislocated on any day; then it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is appropriate for you.
Then apply a plaster, and powders, and a bandage, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated in the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes outwards in the lower parts below the armpit, and especially in those whose flesh is scant; it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is believed because of this that it is dislocated.
Then you must prove this before you are completely certain of it, and then you proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the armpit; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity and below the armpit, towards the touch of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands below his armpit, and raises the joint forcefully upwards to its place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it downwards because it returns lightly.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning of the dislocation, many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and that a softening and relaxing embrocation be administered, such as boiled roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and be applied.
And then the patient should lie supine on his back, and a wool ball of medium firmness be placed under his armpit, and then the physician places his heel on the ball, and raises the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's arm so that it is not pulled downwards, and another minister holds the patient's head so that it is not pulled downwards, because then it immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner:  that you have present a man who is taller than the patient, and he stands on that side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's arm from beneath his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him to make him heavier, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced thus by another method: a long, round-topped pole, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is fixed in the ground. Then, linen cloths are placed on top of the pole, and the patient stands along the length of the pole. Then his arm is extended downwards on the other side; and his body is pulled forcefully on the other side, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a pole two cubits long and four fingers wide, and its thickness should be lessened at the end that goes under the armpit, in this manner:
And then linen cloths should be tied over the round end so that the pole does not injure the patient.
And then it should be placed under the armpit of the patient, and the hand or arm should be extended over the pole down to the lower parts, and the pole should be tied to the armpit, the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm should be placed on a step of a ladder according to its width, and the hand extended downwards, and the rest of the body suspended on the other side, for the joint will immediately be replaced.
And when the replacement is accomplished in whichever way is possible for you, then you should place under the armpit a ball of wool of suitable size; and then apply a plaster prepared from finely ground barley flour and egg white over all the muscle, so that it is wrapped around it; and then bind tightly under the armpit with a suitable bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and the patient's hand should be tied to their neck, and it should be left, and the patient's hand should not be moved for seven days.
And the patient's diet should be light until the limb is strengthened, for it is easier for its healing.
And then the diet should be gradually increased after seven or five days, and some movement should be exercised; and therefore if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity affecting it or another cause, then in that case cautery with three holes should be administered, as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the binding are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and falls, and the patient cannot raise that arm upwards, then know that the nerves there, which are at the head of the muscle, are severed, or stretched, or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Regarding the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the parts behind, the reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And let another binding be applied to it, and cure that until it is healed.
And if during healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use baths many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its former natural state.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of hip dislocation.
Know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially to the front and to the back.  The dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is evident to the sight or touch, depending on how it is dislocated. And when you compare the dislocated hip with the healthy one, this is clearly shown to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the leg, nor can it touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you attend to it and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess develops, for if a hot abscess develops, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is in the posterior parts, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and more painful, and often causes death with it.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's leg should be extended with two hands, and the patient's leg should be extended, and the physician's hands should be on the hip and under it, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then return it by bending the leg with your hand, until you strike the hip with the base of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer forceful and very strong extension.
And it is necessary that two assistants extend the arm, and let two other assistants hold it firmly so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it has been wrapped with a long doubled cloth over the patient's hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this may assist in lubricating the joint with ease; and then push the joint with strong pressure until it returns to its place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be applied which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and be bound tightly with a descending bandage, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and left like that for some days.
And then it should be unbound; and if the joint is set in place, then you untie the bandage and leave it.
And if you see that the joint is not well tightened, then you reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for some days until it is tightened; and then unbind it.
But if there is great difficulty in reducing the joint, and the patient is restless, then administer a warm bath and gentle friction, and compression, until relief is obtained; or apply a poultice of soothing herbs, something very greasy; and then bind it, and leave it on the bone day and night. And then remove it, and put it in a bath; and when it is sufficiently softened, then rub the joint with a gentle friction, and then reapply the soothing poultice, that is, very greasy ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the application of a bath, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place upon it a warm, moist cow's bladder, bound tightly over it; and do this several times, for it is moistening and helps to reduce the swelling.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
A wrist is sometimes dislocated, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints; however, speed is necessary in its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the place becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table, and the assistant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or palm over the prominence of the joint, and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already facing the belly of the hand; then the patient places the back of their hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then let the position of that hand be inside on the table, so that the physician's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
And so if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then constrict it with a poultice, allowing the inflammation to subside, and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise you will not be able to achieve the reduction once several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains twisted, and causes no harm to the patient except that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then you should know that the nerves are pinched or crushed, and then there is no remedy except to constrict it with a cautery near the injured area, and quickly apply something to it.
Then, when the limb is reduced, apply the poultice we have recommended, and let it be left and constricted for five days; and afterwards, let it be unbound and left, and let the patient exercise their hand.
But if its movement is impeded and some severity occurs, then soothe it with warm water and friction several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes fingers are dislocated in their entirety.
And when a finger of those on the side of the palm or the belly of the hand is dislocated, then extend the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it below the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened and set in its proper place on that day.
And when it is night, bind it according to that narrative, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is tight/firm.
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are dislodged from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death is expected for the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and he cannot retain it; and many times some of his limbs are paralyzed, or two legs, or two arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is dislodged from its place, for many times it is dislodged and many times the removal is done in four parts.
Therefore, that is already dislodged to the posterior parts and is called yellowness (jaundice, possibly referring to a discoloration associated with the injury).
But the cure for him is that then you consider if the yellowness (jaundice) comes from a purulent infection, for then in that case there is neither cure nor healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or from percussion or similar to those, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with lengthy discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have already abbreviated that, of which the little excuses the excess of it, for my proximity to my intention exposition, with which I have exposed and formed this from various instruments of that with which I will show this and expound that.
And of those, only that which occurs in the two (sides/feet?) properly is cured with what I have recounted.
And it is that the patient should be extended on his face on a soft cushion near a wall, and a soft mat should be placed under him so that his feet are not hurt.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the earth at the end of the cushion near his head, and another pole near his feet at the other end of the cushion.
And the attendant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another attendant should hold the other one in that manner.
Then wrap a bandage around the patient's head and under the armpits, firmly; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is near his head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around his hips, his thighs, and over his legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is near his feet.
And then each attendant should extend the bandage to the part of the pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be moved from their places where they are fixed, but nevertheless they are not fixed as we have said.
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with firmness until it returns, or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, into which the end of the board fits. And then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician places his feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open with a drill which is turned by hand; and it is that you should place in the ground near the patient's head at the back of the neck two poles, the length of which is one braccio, and near the patient's head at the back of the neck exactly two poles; and let the distance between each pole be one palm, and let there be a hole made in each pole through which the drill passes, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move.
And let there be added a round pole on which the drill is mounted, and let it be rotated in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole into which the drill bit is fitted, the length of which is one palm including the rotating part; and the other two poles are similar to this one.
And then tighten the ropes that you have tied to the patient's feet at the hole which is near their head, and the ropes that you have tied to their thighs at the drill which is near their feet.
And then near each drill let there be a servant who turns the drill with his hand, and the physician realigns the vertebra as we have said.
And then, once the vertebra is returned and the location is realigned, you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a piece of linen cloth whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length is sufficient to cover the area of the swelling, and the part of the healthy vertebra.
And then it should be bound with the bandage we have mentioned, and feed the patient a light diet until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the application of the linen cloth for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is then applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the area behind the spinal vertebrae, and is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and not what happens to other joints with small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and less often forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its inward dislocation is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain.  And this is the location where the pain is often inflamed with a hot abscess because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
And the sign of one to whom dislocation happens outwards, is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And a sign of one to whom dislocation happens forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but nevertheless cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk he cannot put weight on the front; and his urine is retained and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign of one to whom dislocation happens backwards is that he cannot extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending his groin, and his leg is shorter than the other, and his groin is softened, and the head of the femur is towards that place.
But the reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and ancient, which is already healed with the aforementioned having been applied to it, and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not in that cure at all; and then it is not suitable that presumption be made in that matter.
But in one in whom the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care that you return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it very quickly returns and needs no other cure.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with his hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extend the hand of that one from above so that he puts his hands below the patient's testicles; and then tighten with a strong bandage above the root of the thigh, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from him or from the inner part to the groin to the part of the fork (of the legs/pubic area), or from the back part to the part of the back.
And let the extension of all those be at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type [of dislocation] that which we will say of its own cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is in the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be supine on his sound side; and then place the ligatures on the root of the thigh in the place which is between the head of the thigh and the place which is below the groin; and then extend the ligatures above the part of the groin to the highest part of the fork (pubic area).
And then another strong attendant should take his arms, and firmly grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outwards with a vehement extension, for by this it returns to its place.
And this type [of dislocation] is of easier cure, with which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is [the dislocation] excused above you and does not yield to treatment with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that the two feet of the patient be tied together with a strong, light ligature, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each [ligature] be equal to the quantity of four digits, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two digits.
And then the patient should be suspended from the head of a beam, and let him be inside the house; and let his height from the ground be the quantity of two arms' lengths.
And then command a strong young man to lower the head of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and the other young man, with strong pulling, should reduce [the dislocation], for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, as we have recounted in the case of [a] cold abscess; and let the ligature be tightened on the affected leg properly and on his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then let suitable beams be placed in the middle of the ridge [of the back] upon which wet cloths should be wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that during the extension the lower parts are not pulled.
And then each assistant extends on his side, and the physician with his hand skillfully performs the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narrative about the ridge [of the back]; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the dislocated joint, and then compresses it with the other hand, and with that compression he places that which is extended in the lower parts at the place of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended in the lower parts, and he is raised above the ground; rather it is necessary that he be placed on something hard, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about his lying on two hips; and it is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, there is little harm.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board to the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be — and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient straightens his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the limb is returned as it should be — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it so that the hip is not moved in any of the parts; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
Then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
Then untie it, and have him delay walking on it for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: outwards, inwards, and downwards/behind; it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to bring his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration for all its types is that you make the patient lie straight, so that he extends his leg as much as he can;  apply your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; then firmly grasp his knee with your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee with strength, and another assistant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to the thigh easily and without effort.
Then apply a plaster and bind the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with the ligatures which have been previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus (ankle bone).
The talus is sometimes dislocated by a slight movement, and sometimes completely dislocated; and its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, extending towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its slight displacement is by gentle reduction, and this is done by extending it easily with the hands and pulling it until it returns to its place.
But in treating it when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient lie straight, and have a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind at the level of his back.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from its uppermost part, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand, twice, and then extend it with your left; and push the toes of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice as we have explained.
Then, push the toes of the foot towards the leg a third time, and you will be at the ankle.
Then it will return in one or two attempts according to this method, and if you see the foot straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return.
But if the reduction is forbidden to you by what we have recounted, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tighten a tightly bound pad on the ground, so that it falls between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so that it does not harm the patient.
Then let the patient's attendant hold their thighs, and let another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the ankle; and then let each attendant extend against the extension of their counterpart, and let the pad remain between the patient's thighs, holding it back, so that their body is not pulled downwards against their extension.
Then let the physician straighten the dislocation with his hands, and let another attendant hold the healthy thigh downwards, because the dislocation easily returns.
And so when the dislocation returns and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And you must be careful of or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and strongly injures them.
Then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
Then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and worsened, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, then you must administer to its healing that which we described before, in another place of treatment and embrocation, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
The dislocated [toe] should be bandaged with gentle extension without effort; and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in some bone of the instep, then you should make the patient raise his foot onto a place level with the ground or on a table, and remain thus as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joint, and then press that with your foot gently until it returns, and you see that it is bandaged and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board that supports the whole foot, to which are attached two straps; and then tighten that with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then untie it and have him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its reduction is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of these causes occur, and you are diligent in its cure and his restoration, death often results.
And therefore, one should not presume to treat him, except for someone skilled in the art, experienced, merciful, and compassionate, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and who uses at the beginning only such medicines that soothe hot abscesses, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for that one in whom you hope for salvation from harm, with alleviation of the illness, and in whom some hope appears. And then strive to make his reduction immediately at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regime which soothes hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable, using drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and the jagged bone ends are separated, then you must force their alignment, and do in this what we have said in the simple illnesses, as preceded in those places.
And guard and avoid, according to your virtue, that entry into the paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more salutary for your true body, those in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
