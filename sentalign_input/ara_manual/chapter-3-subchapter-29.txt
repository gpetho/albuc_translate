Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction.  When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns (to its place). Then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the side to which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days then release it and extend it so that it becomes straight during that day. If it is nighttime, bind it in the same manner. Continue to release it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it becomes strong.
And likewise, do the same if it is dislocated towards the inside of the hand, binding it towards the same side. Do with it as you did before until it heals.  And likewise, do the same whenever it is dislocated in other directions.
