of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it does happen sometimes, then the treatment is difficult, and is problematic for three reasons:
the first is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will reveal herself to doctors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman skilled in this manual art;
and the fourth reason is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's stone, which is why it requires a deeper cut, and there is great fear. And if necessity compels this, then you must take a very knowledgeable midwife, and they are hardly found, and if you don't find one, then seek a chaste and subtle physician;
and present her a wise matron, experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows some of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the examination of the stone;
and look carefully to see if the woman is a virgin:
then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and instruct the patient to insert her finger into her vagina, and search and press firmly with her left hand on the bladder.
If she finds it, she should move it little by little from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it comes to the root of the thigh;
then cut down on the stone at the root of the thigh opposite the middle of the vulva, where it is prepared and soft, and feel the stone in that area;
and don't move her finger from above or below the stone, and let the incision at first be small;
then insert the hook into the incision, if you feel the stone then enlarge the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have branches.
so know the appearances in order to understand the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, apply ground vitriol to the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stanched;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and bind it with tents and bandages, and do not start this again, and leave the stone and do not pull it out, because perhaps the patient would die;
then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place festers, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
