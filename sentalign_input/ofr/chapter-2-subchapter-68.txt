of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh inside is softened, and it is milky in appearance;
and it is necessary, when one wants to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and cut the skin that is softened down to the natural skin;
then join the two edges with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
