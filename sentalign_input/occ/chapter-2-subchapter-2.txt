Chapter 2.
On the incision of the arteries which are near the ears, called hilasseysse.
Second chapter.
When someone has cataracts or rheums in the eyes or the chest, and this is old, and the treatment with medicines does not help, then the final treatment for this is the incision of those two arteries.
And then, when you want to incise them, it is necessary that the patient shaves his head, and then rubs the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then the patient's neck is tightened with a cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and the places of each are over the places near the ears that are depressed, and they are so hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with the knife of each part, with the incision reaching the bone, and let this be across the width of the head.
And if you want, insert the knife under the artery and cut it to the parts above.
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers together, because when a vein is incised, the blood exits with a pulsed egress, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear at the feeling, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the amount of the space of three fingers, and then mark with a probe, and cut to the bone.
e fort leu ne geta de lu mays o mens, e tot aquo es segon la quantitat la qual appareys de la vertut del malaute e de la replecio de la arceria de lu. And what is necessary to draw from the blood is the amount of one ounce of wine, and then draw more or less, and all this is according to the amount that appears from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause remains on the bone from the brain, then incise this so that a swelling does not form.
And then tighten the wound with sponges and linen cloth bindings, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
