O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its explanations and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is weakened in our region and is completely neglected everywhere, the science is lost and fragmented, and nothing remains of it except small descriptions in books of the ancients which hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are obscured and the science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will bring together the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good master craftsmen are found in our time, the art of medicine is diminished. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number, and the movement and the veins moving and resting, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates said that the name without the deed is much, and with the deed is little; and similarly in the art of surgery.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things aforesaid, let him beware lest he fall into error and kill men;
as I have seen many times many of those who meddle with this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish surgeon who cut an abscess of scrofula in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another surgeon who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he removed with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to draw it, and saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew that if he were cut he would die.
And I saw another surgeon who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound;
and the surgeon, full of ignorance, pulled the broken bones through the wound at the ankles with great force, and left no splint on the wound, and left him thus for a time;
and ordered him not to unbind it;
and it remained so that the leg and foot were completely swollen and came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But still the corruption was already confirmed in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another case where an abscess was opened which was cancerous, and then inflamed through the malice of its lord.
For a cancer, when it is pure of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove all that is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, it is necessary that you know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in several ways;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard yourself, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your arms cautiously, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that, by the grace of God, you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to severe illness;
and remove your weapons from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonishments: Do not take on a bad illness unless you are called a foolish physician.
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is on fire cauteries and on cauteries of sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of the instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is on cutting and piercing, and on cupping and wounds, and on the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is on restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is ordered from the head down to the feet, and the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and subtle science and the hidden secrets;
and of this many of the wise spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some differed and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the opposite: that cautery is not good for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the opposite said that cautery greatly helps a hot and dry illness that occurs in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it so sometimes by experiment.
And in any case, let no one meddle with it except one who has tested it, and who knows through long usage the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time;
of other complexions we do not have fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not come forth except to the member which is cooked, and harms no other member except little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and bring to the member illnesses of difficult healing; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its excellence and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is superfluity.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I excuse myself for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to withhold from you the secret that is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels the illnesses of the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agree on when cauterizations should be performed, and they chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the resulting harm is lessened by the help of cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, and urgent pains that cannot wait for a time when greater harm might come to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as the foolish doctors do; for a disease that is cured by cautery does not return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than other medicine because of the speed of its effect, and because of the power of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the disease sometimes returns according to the patient's complexion and the location of the disease and its strength;
and superfluities are gathered there by the consumption of food and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for a disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a golden instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this falsely, but because of the quality of gold and the excellence of its substance;
and they said that the site of cautery does not become putrid, but this is not true, for I have tested it and found that it is true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a golden instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it is immediately cooled;
and if it is heated too much; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness which is called "soda," and because of many humors which descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all illnesses which come from coldness such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged with purgative medicine purifying the head three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and habit of the patient can tolerate; and then shave the head of the patient.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his knees;
then put the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers will come, bleed from there; then heat the cautery which is called "olive", of which this is the form: And put it on the place marked with ink, and move it downwards and outwards, little by little, turning your hand. Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the place to see if you see the bone even a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
Afterwards take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and put it on the place, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is healed; Afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients say that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses; and therefore it helps to move.
And some of them say that one should leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it is healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and burn so deeply that one removes from the bone as wide a space as the whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors may issue out;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterwards one should treat and bind it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in certain cases where there is cause for fear;
and more it seems to me that I ought to leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members;
and similarly when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first type of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and of this I use the work then together for salvation.
When chronic pain comes in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills which are called "cochie", and head purges and oils and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have said before, and it is not effective. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize it a little below that cautery we spoke of above. Afterwards, apply cautery on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and apply cautery to the place which is called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping is applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the horns be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When a sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by purifying medicines, and the other treatments that I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not help: then I make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it into two pieces at the two ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it so for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound so for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until suppuration occurs.
Afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some cauterizing medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on cauterizing medicines.
The iron cautery is in this manner. Heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the shape of a bell or it has a little curve, and in the middle a small opening;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and an abundance of blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and apply it to the area for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "cultellare," use the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned, of medicine and iron, are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery which is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus over the painful area a line half a finger's length, and remove your hand once, and ensure that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should not be affected so that it moves and that spasms do not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, especially to one who is not knowledgeable and experienced. and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from cold
When pain comes in the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been tried, and the pain does not cease, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Afterwards, prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little upwards from the root of the ear after you have marked the place of the incision; and let there be ten points around each ear;
afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
Of the torture of the mouth
A torture which ought to be cured by cautery is nothing but that which arises from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not perform cautery on those which come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this type of torture which arises from phlegm, by means of purges and head washes and gargles, and this is not sufficient, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the part which appears healthy, and make the cautery towards the top of the ear a little below the corner of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half the thickness of the skin is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the lancet that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after, treat the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it as we have said, and it does not improve, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
then shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the occiput the mustard plaster which is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery: if he makes it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make for him three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space between each cautery of one thumb's breadth;
and cure it as the others, and if you wish to add to it, and the patient is able to bear it, make for him one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others above the two temples, and treat it until he is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of what we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and above each temple, and one behind and three above the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the flesh is burned, and lift your hand; afterwards treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare" which we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain of humors and with other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is seriously ill and suffering, to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, give him gargles and mastications cleansing the brain frequently with good foods;
after raising the head in the middle, and make one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and suffering, make him cauteries as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-sized according to the manner that I have said.
If the patient is a child, make one subtle cautery according to this manner:
When, because of melancholy, the superfluities or the corrupted humors and thick phlegm are present, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have said for one who has paralysis.
And if, because of melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink by which the brain may be cleansed, according to what is written before in the division.
Afterwards, shave the head of the patient; afterwards make a linen poultice well-made, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient should sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then present the liniment, and it is worth using old sheep butter; and warm it over a fire moderately, so that the finger, if one puts it in, can endure it; then empty the circle inside on the head, and let it cool;
and do this for the patient once each week along with other good treatments, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, making several points over the whole cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain equally;
and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and guards it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times on an empty stomach.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the whole cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself against excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood come out, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will staunch it;
And sometimes a cautery is made or applied under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is of cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have mentioned at the beginning of the descending water to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and II cauteries on the II temples, and II cauteries on the nape of the neck under the II bones; and if there is more need, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with one small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient to drink three nightshade berries; after shaving the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery which is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hairs;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery which is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inwards, and prick the eye, and cauterization is done in two ways: that is to say, by fire, or by a burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your care; afterwards, draw on the skin with the eyes a figure like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the mark be next to the hairs;
then place cotton soaked in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
Afterwards cauterize on the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the skin is burned in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the skin retract, and the hairs raised at the point of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed; afterwards cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterwards the hairs come, and the skin is softened then begin the cautery again on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are weak, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one-third, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the skin; and if the disease affects only one eye, one should work on one, and if both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in your lap and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently and move it every time the patient feels the medicine biting, for it bites like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the skin, and see if you see the membrane raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, put more medicine on the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes focused;
then put on cotton soaked in butter until the burning sensation is gone, afterwards treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard your work carefully so that the medicine does not fall into the eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, repeat the medicine on that area which is softened by the paper properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, and according to that should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be denied to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move, nor does he shake his head;
then place moistened cotton in egg white or in parsley juice on the eye;
afterwards heat the cautery which is thus:
and is shaped at the head like the form of a swallow's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
however, that which is shaped like a feather is better for your work.
Afterwards, press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the corruption, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the core;
afterwards apply the hot cautery forcefully, and hold your hand to the cautery at the part of the snow above the eye, so that your hand does not waver; and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, that would be good. If not, repeat the cautery again, and another time if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a corrosive watery medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients mentioned. Understand the fistula, and incise the place; afterwards put into the incision a small tube of which this is the form: and it is made to the quantity of a .3. of lead; and hold your hand on the tube firmly, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a probe to the nose, and to return the fistula to the body of the nose as is necessary in its proper place.
of the cracks in the lips Very often cracks occur on the lips which are called "chapped lips," and especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the sections, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife-cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess occurs in the root of the throat or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it forms pus and breaks and is aged and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the sections, and it does not improve: then you must have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its bottom, and the last place;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupt bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and that is not effective, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterward, lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your judgment;
afterward, let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this manner, the tooth that was loose is fixed, and the softened gums are restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is coldness or worms, and the medicinal cures are ineffective, then cautery is needed in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take butter of a cow, and put the end in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, so moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the fire reaches the tip of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient;
then heat the cautery, of which the form will come later, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the application of that cautery, and then rinse it forcefully;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever head you wish, and according to what you have the power for;
and this is the shape of the chain:
of the scrofula When the scrofula is from phlegm and cold moisture, and is not responsive to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the form follows below, and let it have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and apply the hot cautery to the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it so for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged with purgative medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and do not burn near the heart but a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery be that which is called "clavile" of which we have the form before;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When all the illnesses of the lung are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is chronic, apply two cauteries on the clavicle in empty places; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavile" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the whole cautery which is called "points," the form of which is given above for the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After, cure the place according to that which is said above, and let the cautery be in three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is within the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, heat the cautery which has two nerves of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for this reason a cautery is made with the cautery which has three nerves, wherefore the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, place on the cautery crushed poppy seeds with oil; afterwards make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture come into the stomach so that it alters its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied in it, and the usual methods of treatment do not help, then the patient must be laid on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make three cauteries: one under the hollow of the breast, the size of a finger, with the entire clavicle cautery; and two cauteries outside on the two sides, so that the shape of the cauteries is triangular, and there is enough space between them that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding above the stomach in one point according to the amount you wish to remove; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the cure that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is cured of what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then the patient must be bled on his vein; and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, there where the ribs of the man come;
and let there be a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be lengthwise on the body, and do not press your hand very hard on the cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with the cautery knife, if you are skilled and wise in the art, and be careful that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not come to a boil, for the heart is very delicate there, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment fails, it is necessary that the patient be bled above his head;
and then bleed from the place where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it comes down to the fat, until the puncture is completely burned;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of burns, until he is healed;
and it is not necessary that anyone use this cautery except one who has studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these illnesses have run sometimes.
Then he can boldly work, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
Of the cautery of pleurisy
The ancients said that one should make cauteries for pleurisy from the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: take a root of long aristolochia, the largest that you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and grind it in oil, and apply it to the fire, and cauterize; one cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the part which is below the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, inclining slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another above the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly, as in smelling.
And some ancients say that some people use a fire cautery similar to a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this operation there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops which cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse [presumably a type of illness] with the methods we have described in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cautery which are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three or four cauteries, in a line according to the length of the mouse [illness], according to the figure of the cautery of the liver that we have mentioned before;
and do not press your hand on the entire cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two points, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is near the mouse [illness], or where the pain of the patient comes from towards the left, and let the elevations with which you lift the heart be according to the heart, according to the length of the body, and let the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards put the two burning points in until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three points.
After the cure, when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned above.
Cautery is of no use for a dropsical patient, except in the manner that is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one above the stomach, and one above the liver, and one above the spleen, and two on the back above the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the abdomen should be the small peg that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been put forth above.
When the feet are swollen in a dropsical person, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not go in too deep, lest the citrine water be burned, and let the cautery be according to this shape:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without covering, so that the water may flow out;
afterwards cure [it] with the other cures that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and in the intestine are weakened, and cannot be cured by various methods of cure; and you see the patient is strong and of good constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach, according to what has been said before concerning the cautery of the stomach, a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the buttocks, along with one small cautery with a nail, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient is weak, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good help.
Of the cure of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the rectum, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: three on the spine of the back, those that are completely outside under the armpit little by little in a triangle, and one cautery under the buttock two fingers' width;
and if you think that his stomach is chilled, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the clavicular cautery; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then apply it burning hot to that cut thelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards treat with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will relate in its place, such a disease arises that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupted moisture, then you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and ensure that you know entirely how deep the tent goes.
Afterwards, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to the amount that the tent has entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed;
and beware of burning the nerves which are there, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply the fire except to fleshy places, and remember that it is not penetrating;
afterwards, treat the place until it is healed, and if the place is sealed, and the materials have been removed for a long time, then know that the place is entirely healed;
and if the materials are not removed, know that the place is pierced, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt; and so as one of those that we shall say in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and he does not desire women, then it is necessary that you cauterize him above the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery we have mentioned before;
and if we cauterize him in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then make a cautery on the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the groin begin, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a thumb;
and make one cautery outside the back, or two if you need them;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the form previously described.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers (menstruation) are corrupted and their timing is delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back;
and let the cautery be with a cautery iron, as we have said.
When viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is within the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of the size of olives, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the others;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the socket of the hip, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and large, and let there be between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, wherefore there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the surrounding flesh is burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach down to the thigh or to the leg.
And if it reaches to the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, to the left side a little;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the flesh be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes of the foot or near them, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four points with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more for him;
and if he knows that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with a knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made a cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery in one and in the other, in this manner.
And the wise men said, in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make an iron instrument and let it be at the head as thick as a walnut, or a little less, and let it be between the ribs and let it be from one rib to the other in width the quantity of a thumb-joint;
and let the ribs be open on two sides, and let them also be like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then put it on the hip-joint, and turn it toward the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with the cautery iron and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless it is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with notches in which the edge of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long side, and in height it should have two knuckles, and between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they are open below and above, and join together according to this form:
Then place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very hard on the box on the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles of hot water which has been heated on the fire for a little while, and let it remain for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and burning from it.
For it finds a burning there, just as from fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the hot water, and leave it so for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it for three days so that the pus is drawn out;
and this would be the final help after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for it an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it; and place on top of that pot another pot well sealed, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is two fingers' depth above the powders when you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other limbs.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and honey and anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and he praises it highly, and says that no other cure was used, and that he was healed at once when this cure was performed, and he was bathed as he teaches below.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with one handful of fat, and apply it to the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is slightly warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all leave and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of humors.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly;
and the cautery must be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the small hollow that is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Afterwards, take dried goat dung, and heat it in the fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in the same way, and do not cease to do so until you think by sense that it reaches down to the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from a fall or from a blow or from too great an evacuation, or from a similar spreading of cold matter, in none of these cases is cautery of use, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of foul pills or similar things, that three lines be marked on his back with ink, where the pain holds, and in each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and the quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be done according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three cauteries or four with the middle nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have short breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not apply cautery to a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints.
When joint pain is from moisture that is spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra," and when it is from a cold cause and cures by medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if there is need that you cauterize on the surface of the foot, make a cautery there with the whole cautery that is called a "point". And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make cauteries on each knee, three or four cauteries on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than until the thickness of the heartwood is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist, two lines;
and if some pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the back of the hand;
and if the pains reach the elbows or the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and administer medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend into the scrotum, and this is recent, it is necessary that when you wish to cure it, that he eat nothing that day; and that he use things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his belly;
afterwards make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are replaced, and push them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and in the form of a sign that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
until it is white and gives off sparks. Then push the bowels back into place; and the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return back;
and open the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you reach the bone; and guard subtly that the bowel does not protrude when you do the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that thereby the patient does not die, or other evils.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cautery of children be small according to their size, and of adults also large according to their size;
after three days, treat the site of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well closed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be long-lasting, so that his bowels do not move when he attempts to go to the privy.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and wear it for forty more days;
and let him have good rest, that he works little and guards himself from too great repletion of drink and food, and from shouting too loudly;
and when he follows this teaching, he is completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing anymore, make a cautery of the cautery round according to its size, and let a third of the heart be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place of the incision and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery held firmly.
But the first cautery is lighter and gentler.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes in any limb, whether from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of torsions and its pain.
If he is healed by the first cautery, that is good;
if not, begin another cautery over that one, for such is the custom that it must move to the limb that is near it, wherefore it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great benefit, and likewise the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take heed if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you doubt that the corruption may seize the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize on the chin according to what is described above.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it is clearly evident, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the bridge of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and one other beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the buttocks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
After, cure the place with barley flour with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When an inflammation comes in a limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be a little deep in the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the inflammation is removed;
and yet no one should interfere unless he is knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease that is called "albaras" is old, and the means of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deep, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then cure it with flour of vetches and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and let it be kept on the place until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery which resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And nevertheless the wise men say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the cancer;
and yet this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen this happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery which is called "circular", as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has an illness which is called "adubelati", and it delays in maturing either because of the superfluity it causes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the weather; and you see it hasten to mature: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries in pricking; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you see it pierce with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outwardly in such a way that the course of the putrefaction is alleviated.
Afterwards cure it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens," and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it eats away the members like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat the cautery pins, small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good;
and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this ailment has sometimes been cured by a liquid medicine in place of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with liquid medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the feet, from internal causes, arises an illness which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, foul thing that injures the foot.
And the cautery for this illness is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, like a goose feather, and it should be made of good iron, of such a size that it can encompass the nail on all sides, and that it has fine edges;
afterwards put it, very hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the base of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows crushed with oil, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if they are turned inward towards the body, and this often happens in the hands and feet, then you must apply a cautery of hot water; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a goose feather, and place it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say, warts; and put the chain on so that it encompasses it entirely, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a way deep down to the root;
and let the patient suffer the bite of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be completely uprooted with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from a cold of the nerves, or from a quartan fever or other, then you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the healing of the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted materials.
then it is necessary, when they first appear, that one apply a cautery to each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held to the fire, or of the root of long birthwort, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times great flows of blood occur from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from a burn, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cauterization of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to stop.
And however when this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press very hard until the blood is calmed under your finger, and that no drop comes out anymore;
then put on the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is stopped;
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have said: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by tight binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stop blood; and let it be bound and constricted tightly.
He who attempts to staunch it by tightly binding with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will benefit little, if at all.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a remedy or medicine present, he should put his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it often with cold water, very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and then do what is necessary with cautery and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all illnesses in which it is necessary to use fire cautery, or burning medicine, and the occasions, and the causes, and the instruments, and the forms of cautery;
and I placed that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will go in this chapter by that same way so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, dear son, that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there often happens evacuation of blood in opening a vein, and in the incision upon an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision upon a stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you that you do not undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for treatment. so some come who are so angered by their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they find in their illness, and because of the greatness of its malice; and one must be afraid of these.
And among these there are some who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but put greater consideration in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely on that which you are certain, and from which you can have profit and praise;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your patients to which health should be converted;
and that will help you acquire good reputation, and glory, and memory of praise.
Most dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in sections, according to that which is before, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find that which you will need.
Know that this illness comes very often to children at birth, and when the midwife squeezes the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and for all those whom I have seen, death hastened; and therefore it seems to me that I should leave the work in such cases.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until it could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone above the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you cut into the head a wide incision;
and let it be as long as two fingers, so that the moisture may run out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more grown, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs that you see the sutures of the head opened on each side, and the water spurts forth when you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not restored to you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw all the moisture outwards. Afterwards, dress the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and allow the head to drain evenly, and give the patient dry meat with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the abscess and the collection of water are apparent;
For sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and make an opening according to your ability;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the disease is old, and medical treatment does not help, then the last resort is cautery, along with cutting the two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to cut them, the patient should throw his head back; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with the cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the location of each is behind the ears, and they are somewhat hidden;
then mark the locations with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula in two parts, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can endure, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if any point of the sheath remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and old, raging headache and similar things, and it is treated with various medicinal remedies and none of this helps, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the manner of their extraction is that the patient should raise the hair from his temples, and attend to the artery which appears in the temple, for it appears clearly by its beating, and is scarcely hidden except in some men who are very cold;
and if it is hidden, let the patient pull his hair back from the area with some cloth, then rub the area with a rough cloth, and bathe the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the lancet of which this is the shape: then lightly scarify the skin until you reach the artery, then draw it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues which are beneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that side according to the quantity of two grains. For if it is not cut, the blood does not flow out completely.
And draw from six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that corruption does not come before the healing of the wound, and there is excessive bleeding;
then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery to the bone until the grains are cut;
and this is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up the humors: therefore it is of greater help for humors.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made tents;
and when they are untied, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize it, or you fill the place with vitriol and squeeze it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the place with cold water until the blood stops, and it should be extracted as necessary;
And there should be one finger's breadth of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two ends because it is not completely sealed by this cautery;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is gentler and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the edges should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the head of the forehead, and no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the face of the patient redden, and he feels a throbbing in the forehead like a tremor; and his eye is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and scorched by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contusing cure", and it is that you should shave the hair from the forehead of the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contusing cure", and it is that you should shave the hair from the forehead of the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers across the middle of the forehead descending down to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three fingers across joined;
and have ready a piece of sponge and plenty of cloths to wipe away the blood, then place the sharp spatula on two sides where this is its shape:
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape the whole scalp that is between the two incisions across the whole surface that is on the bone, then do likewise from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove that spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellary", and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And put the cutting side towards the raw flesh of the scalp, and the smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to that which appears of the scalp, and then likewise do in the middle incision to the other outside;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against hot abscesses coming there;
and on the third day untie the ligature, and apply a great abundance of warm water, then cure it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other cures with which one cures wounds, until it is healed.
When someone has an acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes watery and small, and the sight weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that this matter and this catarrh comes forth only from many veins, and the best cure that there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another a little wider. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go to the bone; and move your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two lips of the incision and place old cotton and linen tents there; then bind over it cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things that cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of rosin, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
Of the deafness of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or similar thing such as iron; or seeds, such as lentils, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and pus and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing that does not attach to the ear or grow in the ear falls into the ear, put the ear to the sun.
If you see the stone, then instill a little violet oil or cyprus oil, then proceed with extraction; and make him sneeze with hellebore, and stuff his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and stretch the ear upwards.
Often the stone is expelled by this treatment;
and if it is not expelled, then proceed with extraction using fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it comes out with the forceps, that is good;
if not, then proceed with extraction using a small, thin hook;
and if it does not come out by this method, then make a chain of bronze and insert the head of the chain into the opening of the ear firmly, and plug that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out forcefully, for many times it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, then take birdlime, and place it on some instrument that is sharp for this purpose, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime against the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, then hasten to cut open the ear before a warm abscess and spasm comes;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near the fatty tissue or the dependent area; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it out immediately with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it;
then extract it with fine tweezers and a sucker, as we have said, so that the extraction is facilitated.
Then in the water that falls into the ear, it is necessary that the patient use sneezing powder first, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take many stones, according to the length of your middle finger, and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet from the other side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear; and do not cease doing this with stone upon stone until all the water comes out, and thus it will all jump out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and take hold of the other end with fire until the greater part of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said of the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is of small body, such as a flea and similar things, cure it as we have said in the division;
but if it is of large body that one can feel it, then administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of the worms engendered in the ears, when you cure it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the cure does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear there, then draw them out with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, then take the candle of which here is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the most slender end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole candle; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey and come out, then plug around the candle with cotton as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not readily emerge as we have said, administer distillations which the ancients have proven effective in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and instill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish, take a rasp and wrap cotton neatly around the tip; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever you wish of your medicines, into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then put the rasp with the cotton inside, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be slightly warmed over the fire before it is distilled into the ear; and take care that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to adults through the obstruction of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and this obstruction sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the little hole is slightly obstructed, and one sees it well.
That which occurs deep within, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to heal in many cases, and in that which one can see, you must put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of flesh born or body of the ear, then hold it with fine pincers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is completely removed.
And if the obstruction is deep in the ear, then take a thin, light scraper and heat it a little in the fire, then put it into the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and take care that you do not injure the nerves of the ear;
then put into the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rosewater, and sprinkle on powdered vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and insert another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then cure it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, soak a sponge and cloths in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.
This stye that comes in the eyelids from the eyes when they are moist and dry, then you must spread them with forceps and pincers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterization after incision is better;
and often they return, when anything remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Many times, in the eyelids, things appear that resemble hail in form and hardness, and because of this, this disease is called "hail," and is a gathering of thick moisture on the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe whether the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision wide, then lightly scrape each part, then take it with forceps, and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient;
and if the wound is large, sew it together, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and grasp the hailstone with forceps, and cut and press it from one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is moved by the incision, it does no harm;
and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the place with that which generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease which is generated in the membranes of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and greatly harms their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they always lie on their faces, and sleep on them, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist because the swelling and appearance have covered the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach of each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and let it not be greater than the wound that one makes in the opening of a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several instances exinach comes from the slit, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it whole with a piece of lint cloth between your fingers outside, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is separated;
and take care that you do not insert into the slit, that you do not bring the whole spatula to the eye, that you do not injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt that moisture which remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess develops in the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the eyelids When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and they are neglected, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases such as habitual tearing and softening of the eyelids and albugo, to the point that it causes the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine as described in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cautery, as I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand;
if it is inverted, that is good; if not, then place a needle with thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it to the right side;
then cut in the part under the eyelid, under the attached hairs, with the sharp spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the eyelid a figure of a fish, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you wish to raise the eyelid which is divided in two.
And if there is someone who needs to cut a large quantity of the eyelid according to how much the eyelid is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then place the onion in one of the two corners of the eye, then peel it completely;
then bring together the two edges with a stitch of a needle with a fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and cut the excess of the threads above the two eyebrows with some glue, if you wish to do this;
and if not, then do not worry about it, then leave the stitch and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitching with drying and constricting things, for the skin rises quickly at the healing of the wound and its closure, but stitching is better (as the ancients said), and this is a procedure without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you cut the skin in a shape that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have counted, in three separate parts according to the shape which is here:
then cut what is above with small, equal forces according to the shape which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread, and place it in the middle of the shape; and place one other thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and bring together the threads equally between your fingers;
then raise your hand evenly, and lift all the skin upon which you have cut, as we have counted, then bring together the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar softening ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the wound are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the suture in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of fistulas is according to this form: and it is that you invert the wound and the opening inside according to what I have said, and then make two fistulas by art, and two fine threads as long as the wound and as wide as the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully bring together one and the other above what protrudes from the wound opening, and firmly tighten the two fistulas of the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is constricted will die and wither and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is sealed, and the paper is removed, and the hairs no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two fistulas that you will make according to this figure, and according to this length and width:
The procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and tie them subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then prepare in the case another fine silk thread briefly, and knot the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and small work, then put the needle with the case at the root of the hair to be joined, and pierce it through the skin quickly until you draw it above the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the case, and put into the case that hair, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the case into the skin along with the natural hair.
And if the case is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the case from below with all the thread that you have ordered there, until the case comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then you will pull out the case and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, then attach a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with that one, or leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this disease which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes in the eye, there are two kinds:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through sudden injury, or cut, or cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that suture, and separate its lips, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the illness returns worse than before;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rose water or mallow and linseed, boiled, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent around it, and cure it with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you take care that it does not heal according to the form it had before;
and these treatments that we have mentioned are nothing but remedies for this illness, so that it does not return to the form it had before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accidental [occurrence] comes from a wound and from a fissure and from a cautery and from similar things;
and the method of working on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you stick it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct as far as the right, so that the threads come out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it to the width of a spatula. And if the shape of the paper returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a razor and put it in the fissure, and turn the paper, and make two incisions on the sides inside the paper;
and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "Greek I";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its sides are sharp underneath, from that which follows the paper, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then cure it as we have said with softening medicines and tents, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a fissure or suture or cautery, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the papules, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise masters prepare a device with all their might so that they may restore the figure to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is needed in work and instruments in several ways.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the papule above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the papule, and lift it up;
and extend it with pincers, until you cut what is adhering with a thin spatula, which is neither too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer that the too sharp spatula injures the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scrape off that adhesion, be light, so that the papule returns to its natural form;
and when that adhesion is healed, they sometimes use salt water in the eye, and then wash it with fresh water, and with egg white;
then place between the papule and the eye a linen tent, and put on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and after the third day use egg white and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the corner of the eye is of two kinds: it is nervous and similar to a hard membrane, and another which is not nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and thinks to grasp it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the lacrimal gland, and grow little by little until it covers the whole sight and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the growth with small double forceps, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and insert it into the growth, and pierce it completely with the needle, and tie the growth with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the growth that follows the pupil and the hair to the head, then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal gland with the fine spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh at the lacrimal gland, so that the body of the tears does not come out usually through the incision;
and sometimes the growth is only stretched with the hook and thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a smooth spatula of which this is the form:
And take care that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, drop into the eye a little crushed onion and of the liniment made from litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it as needed until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive, and you cannot insert the needle, and the incision cannot enter, many times this type of nail is cured with medicines;
and grow as I have described in the section, and if you see it needs cutting, open the patient's eye, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula according to this form: And shave the nail thinly, and if you see that it diminishes a little and the shaving presses it, then distill from your mouth into the eye a liniment made from litharge and the red liniment and crushed onion, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is obstructing the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it alone, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then resume the procedure as before until it is healed.
then resume the same procedure until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye by great irritation, then lift it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that the tear duct is not damaged;
then distill into the eye the red liniment which is made from litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and covers the pupil and encroaches upon the eyelids and turns them outward, and resembles a pomegranate rose;
and the procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap, then you open his eyes, and grasp all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly;
then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye in the procedure;
and let the incision be of the spatula which we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small instruments with which one removes the sebaceous matter, as the illustration after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply broiled goose grease or distill red copperas and similar corrosive medicines into it, and place on the eye a cotton pad with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overwhelms you, and you suspect a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and do so whenever flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
But however, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, in the work of iron;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that this member is able to withstand that operation.
There are red veins that are spread over the eye, and they hinder the sight in its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then first that you see if the eye, in which the sebel is, is strong, and there is no other disease except the sebel; then treat it in this manner:
instruct the patient to put his head in your lap, then lance those veins with the lancet according to your skill, and let the lancets be finely sharpened in this manner:
And let there be two lancets by degrees in one body according to this form:
then lance those veins skillfully, and draw out the blood one hour after another, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and take care that you do not injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, instill into the eye green and red copperas to corrupt what remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to remove all of it in that hour, apply a plaster to the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is relieved and the hot abscess is healed, then begin again in the manner described above until it is healed;
and this is the method of bloodletting:
The Arabs call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with burning medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed, then make an incision into the abscess where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it all away with the instrument for which this is the method;
and it is called "rough head," and it should be made of iron with a round head, and it should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the site of the corrupt bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that that corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew itself and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs there, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other device than to return the fistula to the hole of the nose according to this form: and that is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the iron head have three angles, and let the shaft be tapered to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; it is an easier thing for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no obstruction or reduction in the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses or a leech without cutting to draw out the humor, then place on the eye an ointment made of acacia, and aloe, and incense, and sarcocol, and then bandage the eye, and apply a plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and fold each one into four, and then place one upon another according to the amount that the eye needs;
then bandage it over with a strong bandage, and repeat the cupping to draw out the humor without cutting;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night, and if the ointment softens, you must bandage it very tightly;
then remove the ointment after a day and a night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the ointment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of the uvula When a rupture occurs in the uvula, then it opens, and there comes forth a discharge of papules like grains of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see it severed, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper part, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle in place;
then cut the loop of the double thread and tie a part of the uvula around it, and pull it tight, then remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvula, then treat the wound with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvula on each side with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye protrudes greatly, pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches the bottom of the eye, and break up the albuminous moisture and let the eye descend, and it will enter immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a collection of humors in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of performing the operation is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top to your eyes; then let it be pierced, and let the light not descend and be obscured, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a thin spatula and pierce the cornea slightly through the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the iris, until the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, instill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then let it be treated with other treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have here the similarities of the waters in the division, and what is necessary for piercing; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and constrict it very tightly;
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the cornea by the thickness of a ray in that whiteness of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" vigorously, and turn your hand until it pierces the whiteness of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda path be to the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal layer, and then put the instrument to the place where the water is, then press it out one way after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
After a little rest, and if the water rises the second way, put force with the instrument, and when it is inserted and it does not rise, then extract the almagda lightly by turning your hand little by little;
and then put back in the water a little rock salt, and lift the eye inside with this. Then put on the outside of the eye tampons or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind with a healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, put on crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which here is the form:
And pierce then only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle place, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and on completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movements, and let him take light foods, and let him not move his head either to the right or to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark house, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a warm abscess appears, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with something that soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on his face a bandage to cover it for a few days, and let him always be in that dark house.
And then he should leave the house little by little, and return to his affairs;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made almond-perfumed water, which one drinks, but still I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almonds, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and they are properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same subtlety, and the last in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various added fleshy growths arise on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are some where there is cancerous flesh of a livid color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not cancerous, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not cancerous, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the onion on those fleshes, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with all the subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overwhelms you, or a hot abscess, then dry it as is necessary;
and if it is malignant abscesses, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour in vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not come through as it should, know that there is dead flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must put in a fairly thick linen thread, knotted at both ends, with a finger's breadth or less space between each knot; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as much as he can, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and often children do this at school, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull them one after the other, sawing at the knots that are in the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for cleansing the head, with which one instills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a cannula, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed cannula, and let the instrument be full to cleanse the head;
and have a handle at the top to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Often a disease arises at the head of the nose which is called "telul", and it grows and becomes large continuously, until it is a living thing to look at;
and for this it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, of poor sensation:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not of a livid color, and you see that one can cut it all away, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous structures, it benefits little, except in some men.
It is necessary then, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two lips together in a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, it is necessary that you scrape all the parts of their edges until they bleed, then bring the two lips together in a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on top powdered dragon's blood and ground incense; and put on top of the powders a piece of strong plaster or another adhesive plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the suture is that you bring together the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the abdomen; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of the abscesses of the lips
In many men, there occur within the lips hard abscesses, similar to vesicles, some smaller and some larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and incise each lump, and grasp it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stanched;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with drying things until it is healed.
Often, added flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must grasp it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the wound or blood flow;
then put crushed vitriol on the place, or other astringent and drying powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after cauterization;
Sometimes, gathered at the roots of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, are growths that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be on your lap, and clean the teeth or the growths until nothing remains; and so do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other stains, until they are cleaned;
and if what is there is removed at the first scraping, it is good; if not, then begin again on the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth require various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work shows, because the scrapers with which one cleans the outside of the teeth have different shapes than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and ready for you.
It is necessary, when you treat a toothache, that you delay extraction as long as you can, for this should not be done lightly; for it is a very precious substance until there is no excuse for extraction.
Then, when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you be certain of the offending tooth. Often the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and causes the healthy tooth to be extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these physicians;
and when you are certain of the offending tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly apply the forceps; and let the patient's head be firmly between your knees, and hold it so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not easily come out, take one of these instruments and insert it inside on each side gently, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with small pieces of cloth where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction;
and it is necessary to work very skillfully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pain than the first returns to the patient through the malice of the root.
And beware that you do not do as ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have described;
but sometimes cause through this great illness because of the roots that remain, or because of the tooth that they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first moves teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold better.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains [in place] upon pulling, it is necessary that you put cotton soaked in butter on the place for one or two days, until the place is softened, then insert the forceps which are called "algefri", of which the head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not wish to come out with all these forceps, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and put there the instrument which is called "althali", that is to say a small spatula, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out through it, it is good;
if not, help yourself with all the instruments, of which the forms come hereafter:
And one helps oneself with this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and of other tools which are in front in the extraction of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many tooth instruments; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds for himself his instrument, according to what his work and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a bit of the cart or other bones, or if it rots, then he searches among the instruments which are necessary, which I have told you, and helps himself with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that he can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural position, and the form is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot saw or file it:
then remove it; and if it is loose along with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron very sharp at the top:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it appears that one can file it, then file it with a file such as this is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file down the roughness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot bite into what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that is of no use;
then it is necessary to restrain them with a gold wire, for silver wire turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the wire be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the wire and double it between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you wisely reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then start the wrapping again up to the point where you began, and carefully and skillfully tighten your hand, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pliers, and join them, and put them back between the healthy teeth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tight as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the wire breaks, tighten it with another wire;
it will remain and serve thus its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of straightening the two healthy teeth, and the two moved ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, again and again, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes a tooth-shaped form from ox bone, and one puts it in the place where the tooth is missing, and tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this ligament comes from under the tongue naturally, so that one is born with it; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold his head in your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the ligament broadly, until the tongue is freed from its confinement, and if there is hardness or a knot, and this is from a sudden wound, then insert a hook and cut that ligament broadly;
and take care that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is underneath;
and when you have done, lift the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and let the patient dress it each night, so that the wound cannot close up.
And if bleeding occurs, put crushed vitriol on the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed,
and if you see it of a pale color or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is tending towards becoming white, and there is moisture, put onion there, and open it with a fine spatula, and release it on one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, put on crushed vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you draw out all the pus;
then raise the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come into the throat swellings which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, take care:
if this abscess is hard, little sensitive and of a dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a round white color, and the root is thin, have the instrument prepared for cutting, but first see if the warm abscess rests and is calmed.
Then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be in your lap, and he opens his mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, that resembles tongs; and however the ends are curved, and one opposite the other, and are very sharp, and is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, then cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision let the patient gargle with warm water, and vinegar and water, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them in the same way as the two almonds.
And I treated a woman of an abscess which had arisen in her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed the whole throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained thus one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had pushed out two roots through the two nostrils.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a hook in one, then pulled it out forcefully, and pulled out a large portion of matter;
then I did likewise in the other nostril, and I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the hook into the abscess, and cut a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease cutting that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the place that I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uvula".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round and gathered and is not long; and it is bloody or of dark color or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And you must not cut more than the superfluity which is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of being cut, then you must use a method of cauterization so that he feels no fear.
And the manner of cautery is with a sharp needle. And it is that the patient should put his head in your lap, and then press the tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with heated, quicklime, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and apply the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And it has at the head a cavity where one places the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and puts the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient be lying on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine inside, so that it does not descend to the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the quantity of half an hour, until you see it wither and the burning from the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the throat above, until the cotton touches the uvula;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then let it dry, and it falls after four or five days.
And if you need to repeat the cautery with the medicine, then repeat it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton wrapped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and let it be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and avena and similar herbs, and mix them all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot have a perforated instrument in this manner: And let it be of silver or of bronze, and let one of the ends be inserted into the mouth of the patient so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is cauterized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the onset of the hot abscess, for several things may happen; and not to do this except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and place inside the end a piece of eggshell, so that the mouth of the patient is not too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and this is a good and healthy treatment.
Often a bone or fish spine, or something else, lodges in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument towards the sun, so that you see the thing move;
and that which you do not see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the thing will come out through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will adhere, and then pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it may more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough come to him, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient insert the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is lodged; then push it down, or pull it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech from the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look in the patient's throat at the sun, after you press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are suitable for this.
And if that does not work, take a horsehair, and put it in the patient's throat, then put a hot iron on the end of the hair, and do this often. And let the patient drink water all day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I mentioned in the fumigation of the grape;
Do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole is the end of the instrument;
then throw your fumigation in it, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and not drink water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls the leech, when one can see it, is similar to curved tongs to enter the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a rough surface like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot release;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what is remembered later about one and another in this book, and they differ in perforation and in size;
and this is in two ways, one being in its very appearance, and what it contains in moisture.
And the second manner is because of the places where they are in the body.
For an abscess of the head is different from one of the fundament, and an abscess in fleshy tissue is different from one that occurs in joints, and each has its own judgment in treatment.
And there are abscesses which one should not pierce until the boil is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are grown, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses which are near the joints.
For when an abscess occurs near the joints, and it is left until it is completely rotten, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or if the abscess is near the principal member, and you delay perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, pierce it before it is ripe;
and it is not necessary that you pierce an unripe abscess without completed digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply, and become elongated inwards, and a fistula develop there; and cannot heal in a long time.
And it is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is lessened, and the departure of the fever, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and it is necessary that you make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears softened;
and let the perforation be along the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and near nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no danger. In those that bend, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and depths of it will harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the breadth of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many fissures according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and to cut; when it has become like a rag, and is mortified, it is necessary to do as one does with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the groin;
and there are some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuttings.
Those which have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not draw all the pus at that time, but draw a part; then stuff the abscess until the next day, then draw some more again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small children, or old decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you are not to blame.
Therefore complete this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, wipe the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a smooth incision, apply linen or old cotton tents; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must put a tent in each so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have turned it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and moisten a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and care, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very nervous, you must apply tents and cloths moistened in hot wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, you must apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Small abscesses come in the scalp, and there are kinds that are in webs, like the honeycomb of a hen, and there are many similar ones.
There are fatty ones and those with moisture like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is that you probe with the instrument called an "entromissoire," whose form comes later, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then open it lengthwise from above.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it without leaving anything of the skin that contains that moisture, for it always returns when one leaves something there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will drain what remains from the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick matter, cut it lengthwise, according to this form; and pour in your ointments, and scrape it from all sides, and apply all your treatment to draw the matter out where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And also do the same with an abscess if it is stony, and of the cutting and cleaning as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, because they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of those were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as well as from a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except for those that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the pus may escape;
and treat them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they occur elsewhere on the body, and are many, and are interconnected with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own sheath, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not want to obey health.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and is soft on all sides and is not close to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the conduit, and is not deep;
then you must cut it open from above, and scrape it from each side, and spread the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need to, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and draw it out little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far forward, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and that does not allow you to work, then put in the wound ground vitriol, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is subsided, and the wound is softened, and begins to fester.
And when the bleeding is stopped, then return to your work, until you have completed it;
then seek with your index finger if there remain any small scrofulas, cut and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrophula, then you should not cut that scrophula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the whole scrophula, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, provided that there is no excess remaining because of the size of the scrophula. then you must be careful to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then you must be careful to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrophulas which contain excess, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like the one previously mentioned, depending on it, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it consumes what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that one not make aid by this, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss that comes from strangulation.
It is necessary then, when we want to cut the epiglottis, that we cut it below three or four circles a small fissure across, between the two circles or by the amount of the fissure of the syfac, not in the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the master is fearful, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with all the hook, then cut the skin until he comes to the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the syfac, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm of the channel which leaps forth through the place which is broken, and by the lack of voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed of which one doubts the strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound of the heart, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely obstructed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and there is a lack of breath. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason the ancients ordered leaving the wound open until the malignancy of the illness has passed, and it passes in three days or in four. And then they ordered sewing the wound and healing it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to heal her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had flowed from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or duct other than the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young lady except that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her usual state;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called a "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess, the color of a yolk, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or natural has no remedy.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one resembles a lipoma, and the other kind resembles an abscess which comes from an artery; and if there is fear, and it is not necessary to operate with hot irons except in those that are small, and one proves and searches with the whole probe: if you find it like a small lipoma, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it, as one cuts lipomas, and draw it out with its covering, if there is any; and search well all around, and treat it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
There are many kinds of lipomas, of which I will describe all the similar ones;
And now it is necessary that I tell all the difference which is between a lipoma and a fistula.
I say that a fistula is accompanied by heat and fever, until the boiling is past, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat subside.
With a lipoma there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a syfac, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a small swelling, and grows large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy, or moist, and many are in color as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the cure of the lipoma, that you first examine and inquire with the instrument that is called "entromissoire," according to what its form will be in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of the examination of abscesses is that you take the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then do this according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the entromissoire, and take care what comes out.
If running moisture flows, note what color it is, and treat it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if after the entromissoire no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, so treat it then in a cross, and take it with pincers, and peel it lightly on each side and guard the skin where it lies that you draw it out whole with the lipoma;
and if you cannot draw it out whole, then draw it out piece by piece so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the lipoma returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and clean the wound, and apply things soothing to a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the lipoma is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which engenders flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise bothers you, hasten and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and let it stay two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut away what remains of the lipoma.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds of them: large, medium, and small, to encircle the abscesses of fistula;
and they are like the needles with which one sews the sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead to encircle the curves of fistula;
and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these intromittors, the blades are enclosed in handles, so that the patient does not feel them in the opening of abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a fig-cutter, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and it is sometimes placed in the place which heals by cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble the breasts of a woman;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must lance them according to this form, from this line b. down to g.: then scorch the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops downwards, and is softened by its size as happens in women, then cut it in two parts above, by two similar incisions; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then scorch the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said of sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient will not rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter which is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, incise it as we have said in the incisions of scrofula, and if the wound produces matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is healed, abscesses often result, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one knows it thus when it is due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
and when it is due to the vein, it is round and apparent outside;
and it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and in the neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to avoid the iron cure, and the one that is on the head should also be avoided, and in the one that is from an artery swelling, one should cut through the skin lengthwise;
then make the incision with the hooks, and separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle underneath, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw out the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then pierce the area between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there flows out, and the abscess is emptied;
then apply the treatment that generates pus, until the ligatures fall off; then treat it with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you must hold with your hand what you can of the abscess together with the skin, then place the needle under the area that you are holding with your hand, and make it pierce, and let there be a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the ligature on one of the two sides to the two ends of the thread;
and if you fear that the thread will come out, then insert another needle with a thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and pull the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the heart and leave that which is tied;
then place a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatment with tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in many cases without pain;
and when it is squeezed hard, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but below the skin;
and spreads well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and that which is in joints should not be cut with iron: by chance there would be a contraction; and that which is on the head or on the forehead, lance the skin with a spatula.
and that which is on the head or on the forehead, lance the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, lift it with a hook, and flay it, then remove it and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its appearance, and its root is thin, and its head large;
and there are small ones and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had a thin root, and were split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the little tumor is white and moist and of thin root; if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery present.
if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery present. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie the little tumor with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then tighten it, and do not cease tightening the lead thread until it cuts the little tumor, and it falls off by itself without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting itself because of the belly, but you can well cut half, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then cure the wound, and take care that you do not cut the little nipple which is of a pale color and little feeling and of a milky appearance.
For this is an ulcerated abscess, and I will come to the treatment of ulcers afterwards.
When the swelling comes out forcefully If the appearance of the swelling comes from cauterization of a wound or a fissure of the syfac, and is on the belly and some of the swellings come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is by the rupture of the syfac and by the protrusion of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and opens with diverse discharges. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is ulcerated, and increases greatly at the entrance to the bath and through hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and opens well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrict.
and if it is due to blood, then the abscesses appear by these signs: large and hard, and are fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and because of the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and be stretched out straight, then bleed him around the navel; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the place that you have bled with all the spatula, then stretch half of the abscess upwards with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the binding be secure;
then open the half of the abscess stretched above the binding, and put your index finger in, and seek the intestine; if you find it caught by the binding, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then carefully go around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and thread two strong threads, and put the two needles through what you have done in a cross that you make it pierce;
then bind the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as is necessary, and close the wound.
of the cancer We have described in the division the types of cancer, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid iron treatment;
and we say that cancer develops in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be excised, such as cancer which is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning;
nor did anyone ever heal it before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile some times;
then make him bleed if he has manifest plethora, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the operation;
then apply your ointments to the cancer, and shave it on all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, then cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the collection of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the treatment that is done by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and hyposarca, for it is a mortal thing;
Therefore, when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment is not effective, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness besides dropsy, such as cough and diarrhea and similar things; then do not touch it with iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and he has no other illness than dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you must thus work: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and press the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot injure it;
then see if the dropsy is concentrated towards the intestines: if so, you must make three finger-width incisions above the buttocks, directly below the hip; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the buttocks, three finger-widths;
and if it is due to the spleen, then it should be to the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities flow to that weak place;
then pierce the skin completely with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the peritoneum, as in flaying, to the extent of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty place, and this is the location of the water, then draw it out, and insert the instrument of which this is the form: And it is similar to a fine silver tube, and it is made of light bronze or brass, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the aelem (a type of tool), so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die because of the dissolution of his vital spirit, or he will become paralyzed, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue and his pulse signify;
then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the opening which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then resume the instrument the next day, if you see the patient enduring it, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this for several days, and be careful not to continue until only a little water remains.
And if you are doubtful about the patient, and you leave too much water in, then treat him with a warm poultice or hot sand, and by sweating profusely or a bath and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that it be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then place in the opening a thin lead tube, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, the tube should be removed, and he should urinate, and then it should be replaced;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine which comes forth does not leave it closed.
For one whose opening is small, it is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they lift their penis upwards; and cannot reproduce because the matter cannot reach the sea, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies often on his back, then they straighten the head of the penis and cut it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and guard yourself against the flow of blood which often comes, and if it happens, staunch it with that which staunchs blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these albata appear on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
then you must take them with a fine hook, and cut and cleanse them all, then put on moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albata is malignant, of a foul color and foul-smelling, then you must apply a cautery there.
When you have cut it, and if the albata is on the penis, and part is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the albata that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the head of the penis is not assured that it will not be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to his penis and to the testicle;
then you must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and beans, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps with the two conditions together: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, then you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient should urinate through it;
and when the skin is constricted at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or abscess, then you must scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the constriction is released, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is too difficult to remove it, then you must scrape it with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then gently separate the two, and place a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water between them, so that it does not constrict again.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not describe the circumcision of their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we have nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around the penis, forcefully, and with a single lancet;
the heart would flee, for there are two membranes, and perhaps one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and the cleaning which is of the penis is not assured, the tip of the member;
and in the cleaning of the foreskin perhaps the iron slips, and the work is spoiled, and many times they are born thus that they have no need of cleaning and I have seen it.
Of the cleaning which is done forcefully with a linen thread I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the forces cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single moment; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is such that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in every way that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and place the forces between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and blow on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little bit to another little bit;
then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little bit to another little bit; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour at the little finger and the index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly remove the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on, and on the powder a cloth glued with the white of a cooked egg diluted with rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two heads should be sharp and cutting, and the heads should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error of cleansing is when the core inside flees at the incision;
then you must spread it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and that which is below the penis is swollen, leave it until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, and lightly scrape it;
then cut it as much as you can move, and guard the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the place of such a wound with powders, that we have described in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts too deeply and it goes to the surface, it will not harm;
then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from obstruction by a stone, or congealed blood, or excrement, or dead flesh, or similar things, which we have described in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over on his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient should restrain his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constricted to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and let it be of fine silver, lightly feathered, like a bird's feather; and let the tube be a palm and a half long, and let it be narrow at the end.
And the manner of the urine's release is that you take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and push it up to the end of the syringe, then lubricate the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and penis with warm oil, olive oil, and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the abdomen;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty space, and this is not done in this order except because the passage it goes through is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out forcefully, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When ulcers or blood appear in the bladder, or corruption gathers there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines, do so with the instrument called a “clepsydra,” and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the head through which the medicine flows should be such that it closes the penis well without addition, so that one may draw out the moisture, and insert when necessary;
and when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the catheter into the moisture, and draw with the tube that is inside;
you will draw the moisture with the catheter, and then forcefully push the tube back inside; then the moisture will enter, and will immediately reach the bladder, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or of tin, and the head is higher;
and below there is a tube where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it between the two tubes firmly with a good double thread, and gently heat that liquid over the fire;
then insert the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that this liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have, I said in the division, the types of stone, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have spoken of the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stone one should operate on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then becomes stiff; and in many of these, the anus leaks;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in the elderly, and it is moderate in young adults, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the cure, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to draw out all the feces that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the retrieval of the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move him about, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from its high place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it within;
If you feel the stone in the space, hasten now to cut upon the stone.
And if it does not fall entirely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a young adult; and insert it into his rectum, and seek the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press upon your finger, and push it outward where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to raise the testicles with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is beneath the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the sharp spatula, of which this is the form: And cut between that which is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but to the side of the left buttock;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and the incision should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps press with the finger that is at the rectum, so that it comes out without effort;
and know that there are some stones which have angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, therefore the removal is easy.
For one with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, then you must pull it out with tongs which are like a file at the head, to move the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin instrument curved at the head;
and if you cannot remove it thus, then widen the hole a little, and if the blood flows, then staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, then push the largest one first towards the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, then it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly leaks because the place cannot heal;
but nevertheless try to pull it out, or break it with tongs, until you remove it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place over it a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then raise the patient up by his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the place very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions occur in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in such a way that there is blood with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will flow to the bladder, and rot it;
then clean the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help it in every way that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs, and apply the medicines to the place.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the penis, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it in the way I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this thus.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return into the bladder;
then put the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone which is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the threads, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three reasons:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will uncover herself to the physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art nearby;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is deeper than the stone in a man, wherefore a deeper incision is necessary, and there is great danger. And if necessity demands it, then you must take a skilled female physician, and they are rarely found, and if you do not find one, in no way seek a chaste physician skilled;
and present to her a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows something of the art, and instruct her to do what you instruct her to do in the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should compress it beneath her finger, and instruct her to place her finger in the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand firmly against the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vagina, where the stone is felt in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then insert the instrument into the incision, if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound so that the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and which have roots.
so know the similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put crushed vitriol on the spot, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the spot and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not begin again, and leave the stone and do not extract it, lest by chance the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is subsided, and the place is clean, then return to your work, until the stone is removed.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white humor, which is below the heart of the testicles, containing the egg;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one thinks that it is another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white humor that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this humor has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is reddish, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often;
and these are the signs to know this collection, for if it is in the white membrane that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because it has moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper membrane, the abscess is round with one part of the testicle, and therefore it is thought to be another testicle;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with the entirely square probe, the shape of which is shown above. According to that then which comes after the probe, judge that which is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the repletion of his body;
then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart from the testicles;
then take the sharp knife, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise to near the handle, and let your incision be completely straight in separating the skin of the testicles to the white fascia, and carefully peel it off as much as possible;
then pierce the watery fascia with one large hole, and drain all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the fascia; cut all or in pieces carefully on its side, because if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, replace it in its place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, in order to prevent the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if pus is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe away the blood, and place in the wound wool moistened in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe away the blood, and place in the wound wool moistened in rose oil; and place on top more wool moistened in wine and oil, and place over the two testicles, and place over it doubled cloths, and bind it all together with a bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with lint according to this likeness and let them be joined by sewing at the opening of the breeches, and one of the ends goes over the buttocks to the back, and the other to the part of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two groins, and let the whole binding be assembled in the loop of the breeches;
and sometimes this branch is treated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and it is that you take a small, knife-like cauterizer, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white surface which contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the awl, and scrape it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you have eradicated everything;
and take care that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this operation is safer; and more careful of the flow of blood, and gentler than cutting operations;
and if anything opposes you, whether an abscess, a flow of blood, or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are certain by the signs that we have mentioned that the watery humor is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water may flow out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and let the rest of the water flow out, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to escape from the opening of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsies, whose form is shown above;
and slightly enlarge the wound, and know that the water returns and is gathered after six months or thereabouts, and when it is gathered as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in many conditions, wherefore it seems to me better that one leaves it;
and I will tell you the procedure and the appearances of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses arise in the body, and especially in the testicles; and this is due to many causes.
That is to say, by an excess of sharp and acrid humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it causes no pain, and it is a serious abscess;
and perhaps some abscesses are serious, dangerous, and suppurative, and of a livid color, and sometimes come from an artery, or from a vein swelling.
When it is from an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you must not touch it.
That which is made from a vein swelling is known by its disposition to the expression of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this sort, and on the other sores; and it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then extend the egg upward, and draw the membrane from the white, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the egg.
If the egg is already adhered to its neighboring flesh, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg, and cut it;
and if it is attached to the membrane, or to that which is within the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, then it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the egg, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the cure of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you the procedure for it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are near the penis, and let the master hold them, and stretch them strongly;
then cut with a broad, sharp spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scarify on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples;
then insert a needle with double thread, and tie it at the first place where the pus has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in half straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted humors;
then treat the wound like the others where a swelling is present, so that no vessel is cut which nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to draw out the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the incision which occurs in the syfac (synovial membrane), or the distension above the abdomen in the area of the groin, because of which the intestine descends from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the syfac (synovial membrane), or of the distension of it, and these two manners come from many causes:
or from percussion, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the distension of the syfac (synovial membrane), is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscess is even until towards the depth, because the syfac (synovial membrane) presses on the intestine.
And the sign is when it is from the section of the syfac (synovial membrane), that it causes at the beginning sudden pain, and the abscess is diversely apparent, under the skin near, and this is because of the issue of the intestine and the body outside the syfac (synovial membrane).
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are retained there, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore it is necessary to avoid them.
And the manner of the work is such that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand inside into the wound, if he can return it there; then let it be supported on its neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert hooks into the edges of the wound according to what you need to open the wound, and let them be such that the egg can come out;
then flay the fascia which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the white hard fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move your right hand into the scrotum, and extend the white fascia upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and untie that which is around behind the binding;
and search with your fingers if there is any point of the intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, then put it back into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and put it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the waist, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the fascia, which we have said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter in, that no abscess may come there; and place the ligature again according to the first ligature, two fingers' breadth from it, and after these two ligatures leave of the fascia which is under the skin of the scrotum the breadth of a finger; and afterwards the rest according to the roundness that the testicle has;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood runs, and the bowel, as we have said before;
then apply wool moistened in oil, and put it on the wounds, and apply to it the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be sprinkled with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of a fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the branch which is next to the vein, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess with what works, until the vessels heal;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if any descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and yet if it remains too long at this point, the wound or sheath grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the sheath which is in the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture across its width according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the sheath which is under the skin that follows, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the sheath;
and press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the sheath over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then extract the head of the root, and do not cut the sheath nor extend the egg or anything else, as I have made known to you in the treatment of the hernia of the intestines; then treat it by the treatment of wounds.
then treat it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sheath is constricted, and there is no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is gentler in this place, and closer to salvation.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is ugly to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin on the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first cut away the superfluity of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the physician knows how to respond when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then grasp them in your hand until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut each testicle with one cut, once you have properly skinned them;
and leave some of the tunica vaginalis and the delicate membrane which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by pulling, because with pulling, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, wherefore the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the shape of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and she has above the vulva something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and cure it like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine escapes through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tetanus is an added flesh on the natural part, so that it is too ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you hold the superfluity of the tetanus in your hand or with tweezers, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, that a flow of blood does not come there, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and to another flesh that grows at the mouth of the mare, and fills it, and by chance leaps forth, and is according to the resemblance of a wart, and for that reason the ancients called it "wart disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tetanus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come upon it;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come upon it; or it is by added flesh, or by thin or thick membrane, and is formed deeply in the womb, or on the sides, or below, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps also the having of menstruation;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vagina.
If the stoppage is nearby and apparent, then search with your fingers or with a probe.
If it is of a thin membrane, and it is close to the two lips, then hasten, and break it thus:
Put your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the thin membrane is broken, and the stoppage is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it cannot close up.
And if the membrane is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the stoppage is of raw flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound cannot close up;
and thus it should remain for a long time, and administer a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other treatments until it is healed.
And when in the swelling new flesh comes, then it must be cut according to this manner, unless it is festering abscesses. For a festering abscess which is in the swelling, one should not touch with iron.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood often flows, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become swollen;
and we have already said in the division the similarities of these, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swellings, when they are deep in the swelling, and do not appear to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the swelling, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then stretch the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that restrain blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then put her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if a flow of blood occurs, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it and put it on her back.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, then make her bleed with cupping glasses on the back and breasts without wounding;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or in agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have described the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses arise in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscess and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscess, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which comes in the sea, which is not of the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce, but let it mature until the pain is calmed;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats on which he leans, and supports himself on his back and brings his feet together at the parts of the outside of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread, and put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good binding;
then give him a support towards the right side, and apply the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the form comes afterwards;
and it is necessary that when you wish to apply this instrument, that you first insert a probe to know the depth of the abscess, so that what enters of the instrument does not go in deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he put the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one feels it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, with a spatula;
and when the swelling is emptied, it is necessary that you put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dried green oil;
and place the tent deep within the wound to the bottom of the abscess, and place on the outside of the abscess and on the wound clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been cooked;
then cure it after two days with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes one raises the abscess and the wound by a clyster of water and honey, and then of water in which lily roots and birthwort have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden within the abscess, then you must avoid cautery with iron, but cure it as we have said in the section.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife that she know the appearance of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to expel air:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that that childbirth is according to the natural form, and the exit is under its head, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet first, and the body or the head and hands come out first, or it comes on its belly, or sideways, and is perhaps turned over on its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and subtle in these things, and beware of error and deceit, and I will show you all the positions how one must help her.
If the child comes head first by natural issue, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a stool, where the women hold her;
and raise her nature with oil or fenugreek that is cooked, and then let the midwife put between her fingers the little spatula of which here is the form: and split the secundine, and cut with her nail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and take the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to clysterize the woman with a mucilage of fenugreek with linseed oil;
then make her sneeze and cough with sneezing powders, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, it is necessary that you gently put them back little by little; and if they cannot enter, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet; then set the seat down on the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is set down;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife which is mentioned above, and extract the child, and reposition equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes down to the thighs, then instruct to grasp it, and make it sneeze with a sternutation; if it jumps out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to the natural form. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take a poultice of mallow, and oil of linseed, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put it on the woman's genitals and outside this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to the ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and clear her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will come out immediately.
of the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this way, the midwife should put her hands in little by little; then she should be supported by her neck, and her feet should hang down, and she should lie on a bed; and bend her hands little by little, and then take her hands above her belly, and remove the pillows from underneath, until she is properly positioned downwards; and if the child does not come out, she should take its feet and move them forcefully, then move its belly upwards, then put her hands in; and draw the child out little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child which comes from the womb, a hand hanging down It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman get up and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on a seat, then study bringing back the hand; and draw out the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes forth.
of the child's exit over its neck, and it has its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when it is even, then apply to the place a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner with all the afterbirth
in this same manner with all the afterbirth When it comes forth in this manner with all the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the buttocks, so that it is not retained, and the child dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to hold herself sometimes:
Of the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except very few;
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except very few; I know that, if they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane which divides them, which is attached to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out badly, treat them as we have said, and let the balm be subtle, and do quickly and lightly what it does; and act in such a way as is most conducive to health. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more, up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child, according to the measurement of the wise and glorious, and the balm must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; then act accordingly.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with your hands; it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the assistant hold her, where she is tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek mucilage and linseed, then anoint the hands of the one who helps with these oils and these mucilages;
then put them into the womb lightly, then find a place where she puts the ointments that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is prepared so that it descends head first;
then insert the ointments into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the groin or near the sides, and if the descent is feet first, insert them into the heel and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the ointment with his right hand, and put the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and put it in with his whole hand lightly, and insert the ointment into any of these places that we have said, until it reaches the empty thing;
then insert another ointment against it, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then spread it equally moving from one side to the other, so that the worms come out, and let the ointments be toothed to hold the worms, as this is the shape:
And if a part remains, let him anoint some of his fingers with oil, and put them in that part, and draw out the other part;
and if any remains, put this ointment on a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot bring it back because of the constriction, then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it all comes out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
And if the head of the child is large and it is narrow at the exit, or it has an assembled sharp head, then you must put the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and draw out the water; or you round it with the instrument which is called "almidach," of which the form is shown with the instruments in the chapter which follows this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is pulled with the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture which is in the worst part comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut open the belly or chest until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand deep into the womb, and draws it out to the mouth of the womb; then puts one or two fingers in, and pulls it strongly;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted by a hot abscess that has formed there, then you must not work there, but must administer moist and greasy things; and apply plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then administer what we have said for a living child;
and if one cannot, then pull it out forcefully piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if bleeding occurs, let it be placed in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was conceived over that one, and the other was also dead. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to treat it, and I thought about it for a long time, and I could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after some days another. I was very surprised, because the belly has no bones.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I cleaned the wound, and I extracted more bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little pus always came out of the place;
and I have included this chapter only because, when the master finds something strange, he should know how to provide help.
Next comes the form of the press, with which one binds the books;
and with two turns at the two ends of the two bands. However, the horns should be more slender than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the shaft should be one finger wide, and the edge of the boards one finger, and one and a half palms long; and between the two bands should be two additions of this same wood, which are fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the instrument to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar but more slender and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the instrument entirely, have the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then insert the two additions joined together into the instrument, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount that you wish to open the mouth of the instrument, until the opening does what it should.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the surgeons have prepared them, the work is so much faster, and more highly regarded by men because of their quantity.
Do not scorn the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a potion, and hold your hands to her mouth and nose; and if it comes out because of this, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in the pot in water over the fire;
then place a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and hold it there until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the afterbirth comes out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in olive oil or in mallow poultice, and then put it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently pull it out straight, so that the womb does not fall out during extraction;
but it must be moved slightly to the right and to the left, and then pulled; then it will come and detach itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is too narrow, we have described the treatment of sneezing and herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, be careful not to be hasty in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then use a clyster of tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and will come out.
However, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and hurts the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass, similar to a funnel, and one puts the thin end into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be on the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but have it stopped up by a thin membrane: then it is necessary for the midwife that she pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and guard the incision that she not touch it;
then put on wool moistened in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead canula in the opening, and leave it there for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this obstruction comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that obstruction: then it should be treated, as we have said of the lead canula.
Fistulas which come from under the fundament are knots and swellings which come near the fundament outside, or in the space between the two parts, there is one fistula or several;
and when that knot is old, it works, and then discharges white or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are perforated;
and are known by the fact that there comes from them either excretion or flatulence when the patient excretes, and by chance a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach as far as the joint of the thigh, and as far as the buttock.
And thus one recognizes the fistula that pierces the anus, and that which does not pierce: and that is that you put your index finger in the anus, and put a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then put a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or the hair on your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and neither excretion nor flatulence nor worm comes from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not pierce; then hasten to cure it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, the urine leaks out, and cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced as far as the hip joint, the tent is coming as far as the place; if there is no tortuosity and the location of the pain is around, it is that it always swells there, and neither medicine nor sudden ointment is of any use;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of the foolish physicians who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and he raises his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs bent towards his belly; then place a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent comes.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is uncovered where you feel between your finger the pus or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; if you do not work at it, it cannot be healed.
It is said however that some can be healed well, but that happens rarely;
and the help that is done there, is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as is said before; and puts it, all hot, into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that rotten flesh comes out, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is well.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is in the bottom, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula at that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward constantly, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those decayed flesh which resembles a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of those added flesh, and the stanching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place throws off pus, and the burnt flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that suppurate, toughen the flesh, and are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula comes down to the bottom of the fundament, and is distant from the body, put your finger into the fundament, and search there.
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the web or the syfac or flesh, where it is about to pierce, let there be no fear but way of trust and hope, by the administration of one of the three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the fundament, and the excrement comes out involuntarily; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, either by tent or by other pointed instrument; then cleanse that rotten flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the fundament: this will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is at the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent perforated at the end according to this form: And in it place I twisted thread in II, and place the tent with the thread in the fistula until it is at the end.
If it is penetrating in the margin of the fundament inside, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you place your finger in the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one to the other, and leave it one day or two;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and they unite;
then cure the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the laceration, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile (spatula) used to cut open the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the rectum, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the rectum and at the end of the rectum;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and sometimes a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the cure of those who have them inside the rectum, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the privy, until the rectum comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp it with tongs, or hold it with your nail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then grasp them with a cloth, or with cotton, or a piece of camlet; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on some hot powders which are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot exit, then give the patient a clyster of a biting and harsh clyster to wash that which is in the fundament, so that it may clearly exit; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with tongs, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until it is healed, and that it avoids incision by iron. Then you must administer the suture according to this manner:
Then you must administer the suture according to this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread tightly, then knot the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or cerate, and put it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the drying of the fistula or wound Many times there is drying of the fistula in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or your fingernail the crust above, which do not allow to moisten; then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping again more strongly than before, until it is very healthy, and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of the tremor Formication is a slight tingling appearance around the body, and it goes very deep;
and sometimes the cold finds it, and one feels it as if dead from trembling, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the tremor, until the circle encompasses the tremor entirely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the tremor, and put it deep, and pull out the tremor from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of brass or iron according to this form, and let it be thin below and thick above: not pierced, to better hold it with the finger, and better press it.
And if you wish, cauterize the tremor, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or pewter, or of melted or hammered brass;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wide above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there is a release where the belly is tied, as you see, and the bottom is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly in which one puts the medicines be of a beast's bladder or parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each hole, then put in these holes one strong thread of raw thread twisted in X or around, and assemble the belly as if it were a goat; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it as much as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you administer the clyster in a disease of diarrhea, and the medicine quickly exits, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the skin is stretched:
We have, I said in the division, the treatment of wounds;
now we will tell the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to the fulfillment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and what they are made with.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throw of a stone, and the cut of a sword and knife, or of a lance or of a stick or of an arrow, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remainder will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throw of a stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed at once from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not wish to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton moistened in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not exposed to the air, the powder that I will mention shortly;
and if the fire has exposed it, then apply some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by tents, then bring them together by suture, as I will say in the case of wounds of the abdomen, of the suture.
If the wound exposes the bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, then cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat solid foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, also as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it loose, then tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, then the treatment is easy: and that is that you put in this powder which heals before the flesh has moved.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it unbound, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes it with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but the burn has not moved the wound.
And if the burn has moved the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder on it;
but applies some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it casts off pus; then cure it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine forceps;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the neck nerve or artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it alone, and not to apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be lukewarm, such as warm washing in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked herbs also washed in sweet water, and other precious stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it at the lowest point;
and if the artery is cut, and a flow of blood comes from it, tie it off, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the conduit is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the bone of the throat, and do not touch the throat but replace it according to its natural form; and then bind it carefully, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search it; and if there are pieces of bone, pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave until the wound festers, and the opening is cleaned and aligned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, observe whether wind escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood be retained deep within, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and have the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; then there will come no spasm, nor tremor, nor bad heart-constriction, nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healed. Then treat it with tents and other treatments until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, always know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the chest or back, treat it as one would treat a wound on the front; if it is large, by suture;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has reached the bone, and has cut pieces, then clean the wound, and pull out the pieces if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound fester, this will ease the extraction;
and for other wounds in other members, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large and medium and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines protrude, or the nerves of the intestines, which causes their insertion;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, unless one puts them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they return more difficultly, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one more easily restores the intestine to its place than the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will describe each one and clarify.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or boil in water squinant and cyprus and spike, and moisten the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the entry is easily closed;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, so that no one should cut without great necessity;
and these are the instruments for splitting it:
cut inwards in the curve and not outwards, and here is the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestines protrude, then replace them according to their natural form in their proper place, if you have the power, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, then put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then focus on ensuring that the injured part is higher than the other;
and thus you must administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what is prepared, then have between your hands a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common method of stitching, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the size of the wound, then leave a finger's breadth from the beginning of the wound, and there insert a needle with a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the fascia, which is beneath the skin within, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two edges of the fascia and the four together;
then tie a double thread around the needle on two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound neatly, and then leave a finger's breadth, and there insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to the number of needles you need, until the whole wound is closed;
and let the needles be medium-sized, between fine and thick, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and those that are too thick cannot enter well: therefore, it is necessary that they be medium-sized;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far outside the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the healing;
and then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and put tents or small cloths on the ends of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles suffice there.
The second suture is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the underlying tissue with a needle with a strong, medium-sized thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and place between each suture the thickness of a little finger;
This suture is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and the intestines protruded well two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been twenty-four hours outside, and the wound was healed up to fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, for I was in a place where one found none, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of stitching:
Take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through the heart, leave the head of the thread where you inserted the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inner part to the outer;
and the meaning of this stitching is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread once on one side, and take it again on the other, until the stitching is entirely completed.
The second method of stitching, which Galen properly describes, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the head of the thread nearby, and make it pierce only that place, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner part, through the two ends of the thread;
then make it pierce one and the other from the outer part to the inner part, in two other places of the thread that are on the other side;
and this is the best method of stitching and the most common.
Galen says this word, and some testify to it, that one must sew the belly with two needles, where there is thread in each;
and one must put one needle on one side, and the other on the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, then replace the intestine, and sew it up;
then put on the flesh-generating powder, and if the heat has changed it, then put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and the threads are sewn, and the surfaces and the membranes are joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you have no medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in many instances when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound will affect the principal members, it is necessary that you moisten light wool in oil of temperate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the groin, and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then give him clysters of warm black wine, and especially if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine that is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the viscera protrudes from the wound, put it back in place like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become worm-eaten or black, then you must bind the black area so that no blood flow comes there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the ligature, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound to the outside to ease the extraction when the viscera falls, and the wound heals.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it festered and became a fistula, and the excrement and gases came out of it;
I applied a treatment according to my ability, and did not cease to work until he was healed, and the place closed.
And when I saw it close, I feared that the patient might have harm in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be treated in this manner: Take large-headed forceps, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the forceps has opened its mouth, place it over the two lips, so that it draws its mouth over them;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then place another forceps afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely closed; and sew the wound.
The ends are burned in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread that is cut from the intestine of a beast, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is very clean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread into the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it to the opening;
and this method of suturing with forceps is not strong except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no device or remedy, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it ages, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is haired and suppurates.
And a fistula is, in truth, a hard and white knotted swelling, where one feels no pain, and it is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it spurts clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, it is only through one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh within, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because by the property of the region, digestion is slow, and healing is slow, and it swells by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the treatments of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that occur in the large veins, and in the arteries, and in the nerves, or in the syfac, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in some joint of the hands or feet; and there is such a one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a subtle tent of lead, for the lead bends itself around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then clysterize it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleanses it;
then search it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and is it deep, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove from there the rottenness and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then cure it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight place, then it is necessary that you cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in moistened tents in sharp medicine, and push them to the head of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that remains at the bottom;
and then put on ointments that engender healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not bother you in the principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is uncovered, and there is corruption and blackness, then remove it until all the corruption is taken away, then cure it with things that engender flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the root:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other recourse than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and leave none behind;
and if the moisture opposes you, and there is no error or fear, then cut through the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then apply something to the wound that promotes putrefaction, and leave it until the area is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then close the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it must be scraped and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treated until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example from it and be helped in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the materials came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause for opening;
but the doctors, through their folly, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter ran out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many doctors treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated, and what ran through the holes in great quantity; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one came towards another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption reached to the bone within;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with boiling medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strove to heal the place; but I could not, until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and removed it entirely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and closed quickly, and it was not necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not bear it, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation, he bled often, but he was healed entirely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary in any way, neither in walking nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, then it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is exposed, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and put another thicker linen bandage over the first, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and stretch the head, so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you wish to sew, so that the sewing does not injure the flesh;
and place a hot iron or a heated blade under the bone to cut away the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to sew as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and sew again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then put a hot iron underneath, and then sew from one part to the other the corruption, and let the suture be the length of the corruption a little, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and sew the bone where it is held on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that is a very serious thing, but nevertheless it is necessary that you examine that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the lancet and the threads for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their thinness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument that you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses; so prepare the instrument that you need according to what is required.
The head rots either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or the greater harm, of the loss of the limb;
and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it seems that it is burned by fire, and rots after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from member to member, and takes over the whole body;
so hasten to cut, and if it is by the striking of some venomous beasts, such as sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not give it space to come down to the hand.
And if it comes down to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its virtue;
and do likewise when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends in the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the ties downwards, and another assistant the other tie upwards, and you sever the flesh which is between the two ties to a width of one span, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw it, and place on each side a linen cloth, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and another lesion or abscess occurs to the patient.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is completed, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first came in his toe, until it affected the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned in a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repelling things after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also doubted that if I cut his hand, that he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then it bursts and breaks, and the pus leaps out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin which is above is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called a "sain," and is not called a "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, then it is called a "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
see if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes from it is foul-smelling, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put them to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and put it in water and honey, and clysterize the swelling, and extract the pus; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then extract it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the swelling is reduced, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the swelling is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then clysterize with water and honey in which there is a little powdered litharge; or you clysterize with honey and mead, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine helps to drain the blood;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the swelling is well cleansed, then clysterize with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and it is that you take diaphinite plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you clysterize with certain medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then widen it a little with an iron, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too wide, then sew it and leave only the place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it lower where it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, then prepare in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place that is there, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there and if you cannot cut the swelling below as you wish, then prepare in this manner: that the pus flows easily down, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily down, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the swelling, and stretch over it a linen cloth that covers all the swelling; then cut forcefully at the opening of the swelling a little larger than before, then spread a soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it over the opening of the swelling to drain the pus, and do not remove the large cloth outside except after many days once;
and the one that is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take heed whether the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see the matter coming out of the opening of the swelling, know that the swelling will heal, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for healing approaches.
For there are men whose flesh grows slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus escapes from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
and if the swelling is slow to heal, and is far gone, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diaphen ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diaphen ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose water of old wine equal in substance;
then mix it and use it;
and this same thing is better cooked thickened, when diaphen ointment is not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey when it is over the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes one administers long birthwort, and roots of lily of the valley, which is also like chickpea flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard members, or on the ligaments; so treat it with the treatment of fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or by chance arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and one does not take care of it, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and throws pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it destroys the whole thing;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, until there comes a foul-smelling pain, and the end of the finger is swollen, and its color is red.
When you treat it as we have said in the section, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with iron all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, then you must place a thin blade under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply to the remainder of the flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupt, cut it at the joint as mentioned before, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is injured and swollen, and it causes great pain, then you must heal it first;
then cut the nail with a sharp spatula by cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it does happen, apply something that soothes.
The extra fingers that grow on the hands of some men by chance are entirely fleshy, and by chance there are some where there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the knuckles of the fingers.
That which grows on any knuckle of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, by chance, moves;
the treatment of that which is fleshy is light, in this manner: cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: then refrain from cutting.
For that which grows on the finger at the last knuckle, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh roundly to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable saw for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The adhesion that occurs between the fingers comes from birth, or from the closing of a wound, or from a burn by fire, or from similar things.
Then it is necessary that you cut that adhesion, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, that they may not adhere; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If adhesion occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that adhesion as is necessary.
Varicose veins are large, swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many parts of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry burdens, than in others.
Therefore, you must sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, two, or three places, with a wide incision, then raise and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair, then put him in the bath, and pour warm water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, heat it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the knee to the ankle;
then open the skin with an incision, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then put the tool underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then lightly lift it with the incision, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the tool, as you have done, and lift it with another hook, as you did before;
then make another cut, or several if you need to, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second cut;
then pull it from cut to cut, until it is completely out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a tool underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and take care that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull it or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound wool moistened in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must cut it forcefully, but not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and does not cut, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms are generated within the body, between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to come forth, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time that a point comes out on the outside, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is completely emerged; for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad illness;
because of which it is necessary that it be treated little by little to the end, and that nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter that is inside be emptied, and administer to the place medicines preventing putrefaction for some days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and there are many holes, from which roots sprout;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and one feels it well in going from member to member, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and then jumps out;
and is engendered from the corruption of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and lumbríci and ascárides come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and draw it out, then one cannot pull it out except when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong ligature very tightly, then cut above and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does, is that it runs to the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, then press down strongly on the eyebrow below it, then cut above, and pull it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily cleansing using purgative medicines for the bad, corrupt humors, and to abstain from foods causing putrefaction.
of the pain which comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and shortly afterwards, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly turned around her body, as I saw it.
I greatly wondered how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. Nevertheless, I had seen many who had felt pain move from place to place, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins uncovered, and therefore that constrained windiness appeared;
and it does not appear according to this reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and covered veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then bind it above and below quickly, and then cut above until that constrained windiness issues forth from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels windiness, such as fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are some which have large points, and small ones, and barbed ones, and smooth ones; and of those which have two angles, and of those which have barbs, and of those which are broken;
and that which strikes in a limb strikes in two ways: or in a principal member, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then strikes in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you later, appear: then you must beware of extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then I draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow strikes it and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is above the brain is injured, are:  scotoma and throbbing and dizziness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and there emerges from the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and also something like shredded flesh;
and if these signs appear, refrain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs that the arrow has reached the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and there is coldness and cold sweat, and syncope: know then without doubt that death is imminent.
And the signs that the arrow has injured the lung are that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and he breathes heavily and feels great pain and sighs; and all the limbs from the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps some undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some dung spurts out through the intestines, there is no hope of a cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the arm and the spine of the back and the ribs and the thigh and the legs, and similar members, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I shall tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it out from below the fat of the ear on the other side, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew out at one time an arrow that struck him in the fatty tissue of the eye below the eyelid; and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with barbs:
I sawed the barbs, and worked so subtly that I drew it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut on the arrow, and I grasped it, and drew it forth strongly, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man from whom an arrow fell on his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find hindrance in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow fell, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning towards the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen in three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I searched it entirely with a slender probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prickling and pain under his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I applied to the place an attractive and digestive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the place of the arrow appeared to me.
and the place of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put a corrosive, sharp medicine on the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared to me visibly;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I put in the forceps, and moved it from one side and the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise various instruments, until I grasped it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will be at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and healed the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of some arrows, so that you apply your care to what I do not say, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master considers even a small thing well, and from what is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, in the treatment of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not emerge from the limbs where they are fixed except according to two methods: either through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and leaping out sometimes immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, then leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, then leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, then pierce around it with a thin drill, until the place around is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is hidden in the body so that one cannot see it, then search for it with a tent; and if you feel it, then pull it out with some suitable instrument;
and if you cannot [do so] because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve or vein [nearby], then enlarge the wound so that the wound is large;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, then remove the flesh that is stuck in on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, for then you would pull it out more difficultly.
And if you cannot [pull it out] at once, then leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, then administer what we have said of the treatment in its chapter;
and guard yourself from cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can pull out the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient according to the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen where it is clearly seen or felt:
then cut above, so that the forceps can grasp it, and then extract it: if it jumps out now.
And if it is lodged in the bone, rotate your hand round and round until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for now, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, remove it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you want to administer a pulling action, then administer a hooked instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the hook of the instrument;
and then pull it out, and if the arrow is hooked, use an instrument with a point entering inwards, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can, then treat the wound as is necessary.
And if the arrow breaks in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is close, and you can cut to it, then cut.
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are extracted is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like the feather of a bird, to push at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
There are 31 veins from which one is bled, of which there are 16 in the head, namely: Two temples which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein which is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth, and these are the veins which are called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "fast", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "vein of the belly", and it is above the fossa, and it is that from which one bleeds, which appears manifestly on the wrist.
And the salvatiella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphena which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nessa", which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrhs and with migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then press them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and put it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand with the whole vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers across, and let out blood as much as you wish;
then restrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already spoken of incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and toothache, and habitual ophthalmia, and for a flow of watery tears from the eyes;
and the qualities of the bleeding are as I said: and it is that the patient should strain his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feels the pulse under your finger, and then bleeds from there;
then lift the skin above the vein up with your index finger, and put the lancet underneath, and lift the vein up, and cut it, as you have done in the two other veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then untie the patient, and put your finger on the vein for an hour, then put cotton on it; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the frontal vein is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the method is that the patient twists his neck, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called "fosseur", of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you wish; then untie the patient's neck, and bind the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work is done with a wide blade.
However, it is not necessary that the blade be too sharp; and cut across, because the bone is near, and perhaps the blade will break when it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins that are in the two temples helps with them, and with ringworm, and with redness, and with hordeolum in the eye, and with diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bleeding is such that the patient should constrict his neck by twisting with some cord, as before;
then bleed, and let the bleeding be across, a little along the length of the blade a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the blade is thin, perhaps it will break;
then make the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for fever, and for raging thirst, and for facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, and especially when it is old;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin blade, and insert it into the lip in the space that is between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear well outside, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for a night, for it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two temples helps in the constriction of the throat, and in the beginning of leprosy, and in many diseases, and in impetigo, and in toothache, and in herpes, and in fistulas;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck from below on both sides, as we have said;
and let the master stand above the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do likewise in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of the bleeding of the lips Bleeding from the veins of the upper lips helps with bile in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the quality of the bleeding is to make the patient sit before you, and bind his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is in the right lip and the other in the left, and they are known by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are small black veins:
cut then one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts his tongue, and looks on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the neck which are commonly bled are bled in two ways:
either by pricking with a flat, myrtle-wood lancet, or an olive-shaped, subtle one like a cutting knife, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide and narrow according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle-wood lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is needed to open hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more subtly pointed, and is for bleeding the thin veins, where there is thin, yellowish blood.
Bleeding of the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleeds wisely, and that he guards against the artery which is below. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then he must stanch it, as I have said; and the blade should not be sharp, but cutting like a knife.
And if the basilica does not appear manifestly, then it is necessary that you search for it, and choose another; or you seek some vein of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears manifestly; and cut it with a knife, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, it is necessary thus that you stretch the arm, that you touch the place until you know the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with a sharp knife; and beware that you do not strike the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: hasten yourself then, and place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if it is the arm, bind it up, and leave it thus, and let not the patient move it;
and let it be with fear, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the ends of it retract; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of bark from a fig tree, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on well until the next day;
if the blood stops, it is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of blood is not difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the ligaments of the arm.
The bloodletting of the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and the cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be careful of the nerve that is below, and if he goes too deep, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve is often visible, and if it is not visible in some men because of its thinness, then you must bleed it with a lancet; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking at the olive-shaped vein or the myrtle-shaped vein, for it is the safest of all veins, because beneath it there is neither nerve nor artery. However, one must seek the lightest place, and it matters not if one fails the first time, and one tries again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one fails the first time, but it matters not.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that bloodletting is administered only to maintain health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the arm: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed in the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting which is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but when there is need, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years, nor a woman carrying a child except from the fourth month to the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor the dropsical;
and one should beware of bleeding after colic, vomiting, and diarrhea, and after much intercourse with a woman, and after labor, wakefulness, and fasting, and anything that weakens, either in mind or body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and by medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to refine the blood, and bleed him from the vein of the arm near the third, as we have said;
and on that day guard him from work, and pain, and lust, and similar things;
and be cheerful and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one who is bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature moderately above, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the blade with a little old oil, then puts his finger of his left hand on that vein a little below the place where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one puts the blade on, it withdraws from the blade, and one cannot open the vein, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be wise in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, it is good; if not, then begin again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave him for one or two days, and do not bind the arm: by chance an abscess will form there;
nor enter a bath, then begin the bleeding again if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you doubt that as much blood will come out as you wish, pierce into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work a little quickly, before the place becomes swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not restart the bleeding, and put on a little oil of lead, for it lightens the body of the blood, and lead is milder in this place than oil;
and thus administer the oil of lead in each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and the same does theriac and ox-gall, when one puts it on the place; it thins the blood and separates it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled except at that time when the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt a little warm, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the bloodletting from the vein, and if there remains at the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does no harm; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mint, or the like.
And many times an abscess and appearance occur at the bleeding of the basilica vein:
then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft with the compression of the hand, then that appearance is bad. Avoid therefore putting on anything of what we have said, for perhaps it cuts into the artery;
but make him a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each one according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let so much out that it becomes red; and if you see it thick, let it out until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made for him, and the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding is safer from blood flow and cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or widely.
And to one whose body fails during bleeding, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bleeding bread soaked in mulled syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the exit of much blood, then he should drink broth of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the section or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to bleed from another place, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; therefore it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and widen the opening until it falls into a faint; then, when you consider all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, that death does not come in place of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you wish to untie the arm, and to let blood out a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is bent, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein flows out freely, and put on it a little salt mixed in water, and press gently upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the vein of the head because it is well-composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the area is red;
then it is moderately bound, so that the vein appears well, then bleed immediately across, not wide or long;
and let the opening be wide, and bleed very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for one puts it in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the manner:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, entirely bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is needed, put oil and wax on the vein to quickly close it, and do so for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphenous vein is good for all the illnesses that are in the lower body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and illness of the kidneys, and of the old thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs over the vein until it swells, and binds above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many veins go above the foot;
bleed then in the largest vein, or at the ankle, which is most effective.
And if you bleed it on the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed across as if cutting;
and let the blade be sharp.
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again a little higher, for the place is salty;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do so for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bleeding is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle with four fingers twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very plentiful in many men.
and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very plentiful in many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and venesection is done in two ways: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this venesection which is without cutting is done in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and venesection which is done by cutting and by extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and another is in the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping glass under the chin; and the cupping glasses on the two shoulders; and the cupping glasses on the buttocks; and the cupping glasses between the two arms; and the cupping glasses on the two legs; and the cupping glasses on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bleeding from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or by custom, then we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temple helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not suitable for those of a cold complexion, or who have catarrh, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not suitable for the elderly to use, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who is often bled, becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping glass a little lower because of the risk of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for a fissure in the bronchus, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it adheres too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
Cupping at the second rib of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to carefully feel for the artery when applying the cup, so that he does not cut it, and a sudden flow of blood does not result.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and congestion.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as bleeding from the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the phlebotomist not to go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and has nerves and arteries underneath.
The cupping glass that is on the buttock is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for lower diseases, and the cupping glass must be large, and be of bronze, that it may draw well; and perchance, if it were thin, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
Cupping of the legs heals openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the womb, and of the bladder, and restore the menses;
and are applied to the two ankles, and the two heels, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and bring on faintness in many cases.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease to do this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and reapply the cupping glasses, and take heed of the constitution of the bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the passage of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we wish to draw blood little by little, one time is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, let us begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balm oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one whom you treat has tender flesh and large pores, then it is not necessary to put any oil there, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And the one who has much moisture, let him rise with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise with old wine, or beet water, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not bleed with a cupping glass before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath, one or two hours;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be warmed, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chicken, and capon meat, and moist meats.
and eat chicken, and capon meat, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chicken and small birds and pigeons;
and the day that he is cupped, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after cupping, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not fitting that those who are hot drink it.
The cuppings which are applied without cutting are those which are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the bladder and the kidneys and the hip, for these members do not tolerate being cut, and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another, just as we apply them to the breasts when the milk flows;
to remove the viscosity which is in the member, just as we apply cuppings to the belly and to the bladder to reduce the member;
and removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, thus removing by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodging the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cuppings are applied empty to suck only; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a manner that one fills the cupping with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as if to insert a needle, and let it be of brass, smooth in front so that it does not wound the patient when applying it to the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of brass or iron, to place a burning candle, and let there be large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who receive them;
for the cuppings of children are different from those of the old, and of the thin from the fat.
And one should thus apply this cupping glass to the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and place it in the cupping glass across the bar which is in the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with acute [symptoms], there is no bar nor hole, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only;
and this is the method:
Leeches are not administered except in limbs where cupping glasses cannot be placed because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or toes, and others similar;
and the qualities of the leech are such that when you find leeches that are in clear fresh water without putrefaction, you should take them;
and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry and have nothing in their bellies; and then let it be bled with a vein incision and cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where you can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for that is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the place with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then wipe it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches are removed, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it until the bleeding stops;
and if the bleeding is excessive, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it stops;
or you may put on the place halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the place, it will stop immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood comes out, and then apply them, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they are falling off, sprinkle a little aloes and salt, ground, or ashes, on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fracture and dislocation.
Know, dear son, that foolish people scorn this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letters about it;
and for this reason the science is neglected in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the knowledge from it, and through experiment, and through the custom of my life;
and I have described in this chapter what is contained, and have shortened it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary then that we say in the prologue of this book the sum of the speech and the chapters where the wise man sets his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or contusion comes to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or infants, or old men; or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold things, that is to say cold pottage, and the flesh of birds and of kid, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no fear of a hot abscess, nor of the spreading of matter in the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that provide great nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow's paunch, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the flesh is repaired and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of old and decrepit people cannot be well repaired nor knit according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs, nor those also that are too tender, such as the bones of little children;
but in treatment, reset the broken bone with thick bandages which support and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not leave it at all from its work, and for this reason it is necessary to nourish it with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fracture. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another by sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another by sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small fissure.
And each manner has its device, and its proper instrument in the restoration, according to that which the remembrance comes into its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known by this, that the place is twisted, and it appears well by swelling, and sounds on pressing with the hand;
and when there is no twisting nor sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be twisting, or fissure, or small fracture. Then it is not necessary that you move it by hand, but apply the medicines which come next, and then restrain it subtly now.
And know that in a fracture that goes across, and the two parts are disjointed, it is necessary to set them equally, before abscesses form there;
and if hot abscesses form there, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are subsided;
then set it evenly so that you can easily and wisely, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of that in which there are pieces;
then restrain it, as is necessary hereafter.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, extend it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, restore by all means the additions to their places as much as you can, and ensure that your work does not cause injury or pain to the patient;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
then straighten it nicely, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is in place, instruct the patient well that he not move it, neither waking nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other manner; and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is set straight, so that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in greatness and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and the like: then it is necessary to wrap it with soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap it with a wide and strong linen, because the wide linen embraces the whole large limb, and constricts it equally on all sides, so that there is no slack;
then tie around light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole linen, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture may then separate the fracture a little;
and soften the linen little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy place, then take another linen, and turn again over the broken place;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten moderately, neither too strongly nor too weakly, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the linen bandages tow or cloths, until it is all even, then tie all above with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and that removes the swelling, and leave it so for some days;
then tighten your splints, and let them be half of a wisely sawn wide cane, or of wood from which clefts are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one puts on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then tighten the splints as you did in the first binding, then tie over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less;
and the threads should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth of space between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after the tightening in healthy places, place under them linen or carded wool padding, so that he is not wounded.
When the wound is accompanied by a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints until after five or seven days, or more, depending on your certainty of a hot abscess occurring;
And here is the manner of the ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with plenty of egg, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring the fracture in many situations, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take three ounces of labdanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and myrrh, of each ten ounces; myrrh and aloes, of each five ounces; chamomile nine ounces; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; if the man's complexion is hot, he should use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is of value to many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for a sprain: take mugwort and mallow, each ten ounces; myrrh and aloes, each nine ounces; acacia six ounces; Armenian bole ten ounces, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another type of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and the chipping and breaking of the bone: Take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and boiled oil, and apply it to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes the pains.
Another type of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and for reducing the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, flaxseed, balausta, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all equally one part; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put anything on a broken limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else more, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And it seems to Galen that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another kind of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and mix them equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it.
And then unbind it a little afterwards, and take care if the patient feels no pain, or if the bone has not moved from its place; if not, unbind it in a few days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, without rest or swelling, hasten, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a wet sea sponge, and dip it in water, and bathe the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it on tightly, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then begin the binding subtly, and a little plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and continue subtly until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling are completely gone, and you need a plaster and a bandage, then start again, as you did before, equally.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture heals, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then restrain it more than before, and it will thicken its flesh, as I said before;
and if you see the place drying more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and that should be every third day, and loosen the binding a little;
by this work then nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and swiftly amends what foolish leeches do, who bind the limb too tightly:
that is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing else but leaving it and working properly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and various forms, and the causes are different;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks the bone all the way down to the bone marrow which is under the bone, as an axe or club does; and for that reason this kind of fracture is called "hachure".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound from these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt impact, or a fissure from a stone blow, or from falling on a stone, or similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is a crack in the bone as fine as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives a piece of the bone inwards, and the place is dented as the caulkers do when they strike cauldrons; if the stone enters within.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, such as the heads of children;
and it happens in all these kinds of fractures that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh which is on top.
The hair-like appearance is known by this, that when the bone has been uncovered, and one rubs against it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the accidents of the patient, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and swelling, and throbbing, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar things in many conditions, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening accident, and you hope for salvation, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded man first comes to you, and it is in winter, then it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the accidents that we have mentioned come.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, then it is necessary that you split the split part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and on the surface of the wound as smoothly as you can, and if bleeding occurs upon uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are assured of the cessation of bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of work:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then put another incision there, larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and they are of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you administer incisions with a trephine, not so deeply that it pierces beyond the skull bone, and it should have a margin or a circle above the point, so that it does not let the point pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes in its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have trephines for the whole head;
and this is the form of the three types of trephines:
The method for piercing around the broken bone is that you place a trephine on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the trephine elsewhere a little afterwards, and do so all around, then cut with the incisors the space of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you remove the bone with your hand, or with one of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, it is necessary that you smooth the remaining piece of bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and he praises it highly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone, where the broken ends are seen, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And it does not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike gently with a small mallet, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is adhered to the bone, remove it gently, for it is removed well without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and the bone is cut only on top, and there are small pieces, then you must remove that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to use in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
Begin with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is smooth.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle breaks, you must apply a remedy according to its nature;
and this is something that is not unknown to one who has studied this art.
And if the dura mater is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled over two or three times, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the dura mater, then apply another bandage on top, and do not tighten it more than is necessary to hold the wound only;
and leave it like that for one or two days, until the inflammation of the abscess is subsided, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and bean flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medicines without biting [ingredients].
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment there, nor allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the covering of the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when one puts something biting on the dura mater, it withers above. Take care then, if any bad accident befalls the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes there only because of the medicine that has been put on, that has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil and glue one cloth, and put it on the dura mater; then treat it with the methods of treatment that are necessary, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose above are broken, or one by itself, for they are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the hole of the nose, and set the broken part inside with your index finger, and with the thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it with the end of a slightly thick rod.
And if the break is in two parts, do the same, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then put into the nostril tents of linen cloths, if the break is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the break is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a confection of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth around it, and holds the fracture, and the patient blows through it; or do whatever you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerote or cotton moistened in rose oil, or in a little diaquil.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, apply a plaster externally, of linseed meal, and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then apply light lint, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh, and solder, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and insert lead weights, until it is healed.
When the jaw is broken below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two, except perhaps inwardly, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently put the fracture back in place, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and set it even.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two parts, until they are even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, bind them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then place cerate on the broken jaw, and place a double cloth over it; and place on the cloth a well-made large plaster, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and apply a plaster, of the powder from the mill with egg white or wheat flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the condition of the patient does not change, leave it until it is healed; it is often healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses appear, administer what we have often said.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of the bone is removed; then carefully remove it with the appropriate instruments.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is wide, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The clavicle breaks many times in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken clavicle; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor shortening.
And if you need to extend further, then place under the patient's shoulder a round bolster of cloth or wool, and let it be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and pull the bolster with your hand, so that you set the fracture as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the clavicle outwards, because it is deeply impacted, then it is necessary that the patient lie often on his bed, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and let the assistant push the shoulder down, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must make an incision.
and pull the pieces gently apart, and if the bone cannot join because of some obstacle, then cut it with one of the scalpels that you have; but that you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the viscera:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the requirements of the operation;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you have made when you pulled the bones apart;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, then cauterize the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with lint and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses develop, soak a piece of lint in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of ground powder and egg white, and place light tampons on top, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a handspan wide, then place a double layer of cloth over the tampons and the plaster; then take a thin strip three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the strip on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and tighten it on each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the strip does not move on the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit while he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will relieve the fracture of the collarbone by easing the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is necessary, and tighten it and leave it thus, until he is healed;
and it is healed in at most twenty-eight days, and in less in some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks either at the wide part or in the middle, and it is only known by touch;
then set it according to the shape of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can;
then put on the place mill powder with abundant egg white, and light lint, and put on a double cloth; then put on a broad and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there is hair under the splint at any place on the shoulder, fill that hair with linen lint, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the bandage each day;
and every time that it loosens, bind it, and adjust the splint if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number of days is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not a bone that easily becomes dislocated.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes, and points below the heart, make an incision, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to appease a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breastbone
The breastbone is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks at the end.
And when it is broken in the middle, it inclines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and immediately, and perhaps vomits blood, and the movement in the broken bone is apparent, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and a cushion is placed between his shoulders, then press the shoulders, and bring together the ribs of the two ribs with your hands, and subtly put it equal in all ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and lint over the broken bone with fine salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage round the back, and bind it tightly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it is necessary to unbind it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster, and treat what has come there in the manner of cures;
then replace the plaster, and bind it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only occurs in the large spaces behind the back, and in the front near the chest, and they only break because they are brittle; and one feels it well upon examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is such that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is displaced inwards, the patient feels very great pain and a stabbing sensation, as with pleurisy, for the bone pierces the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and quickly vomits a great deal of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have applied great ingenuity to it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outwards.
We do not do this, so that hot abscesses do not form there, if they have not already formed. And if they have formed, then treat them.
And some of them say that one places cupping glasses on the area, to strongly suck, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might draw superfluities to the area due to its weakness.
And some of them say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in hot oil, and place tents between the ribs to equally distribute the bandage around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels such great pain that he cannot bear it, because of the bone that pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the pleura;
and then one must cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses appear, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area in the meantime as is necessary for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it is, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then take note if you see his hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortally wounded in several ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pricked and prodded, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is taken.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then take note if his feet are softened, and if the symptoms are there which are in the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary discharge;
and when he is turned on his stomach, there is involuntary discharge. And when he is turned on his back and wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortally wounded: so do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the condition is less serious.
And the cure is that you observe if there is a hot abscess; then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the cow," if you put your little finger of your left hand there, and set it even with the other hand to your ability, then apply the plaster and the splint on top, if you need it;
then pull it, and if there is a separated bone, cut above it, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a slight lessening at the head; and it cracks lengthwise, and slopes inwards, and the patient feels pain at the site, and a stabbing pain, and the broken part swells.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is of its natural form.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it slopes inwards, then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the binding is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses appear there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are calmed, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the rib and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight stick of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them upwards, and the patient sits on a seat;
then place his broken arm on the stick, until it reaches the armpit, and let there be a curve of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy thing or the attendant stretches it downwards;
then let the physician set the fracture equal with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one supports the patient on his mattress, and ties his hand to his neck, then instructs two attendants that one holds that which is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below with a cord, and each stretches at his part.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then tighten a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and let each of the attendants stretch at his part.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must put a cord in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then it is necessary to put a cord lightly, without effort, until the fracture is even on the place, and on the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and tighten it, if no abscess forms there.
And if an abscess forms there, then do not tighten it until seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess is calmed;
then tighten it, and the manner of tightening is that you put the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and put your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and put the cloth, and tighten it on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, then use splints, and place on the fracture one splint larger and stronger than the others, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it surpasses the fracture by three fingers' breadth on each side;
then tighten over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less so as it heals.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time that you restore the broken limb, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave it to heal until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If so, adjust it, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not unbind it before three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder one cushion filled with wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then adjust it by the virtue of medicine, and give him the food that we have mentioned before, in such a way that the food is at first subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be healed in forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to dress the place.
And if the stricture is serious and swollen, it takes fifty days or two months to unbind.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile", of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the little finger;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile is broken alone, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be extended slightly, and set even.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be pulled more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the thumb higher than the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no labor;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the part below his hand, or to a ligament, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each one in its place, and if there is any separated piece that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the individual chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the resetting, hot abscesses arise, then apply a cerate cloth made of rose oil and white wax, that it may be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster of the mill's powder with plenty of egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and bind more tightly over the fracture than elsewhere, and always less tightly as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident happens to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must bathe the limb in warm water until that itching is calmed;
and do not let the limb rest tightly bound.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bone separated, and similar things, then redress it.
And then take care that nourishment can reach the limb, for if it is too tight, you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands around his neck, and let his neck be straight, and guard against movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the constitutions and complexions of the humors.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending happens many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, it is necessary that the patient sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him evenly;
then he places his hand on a flat surface, and the attendant extends the broken bones, and aligns them properly, until they are well-joined;
and applies the plaster and lint, if no abscess forms, then he applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside towards the belly of the hand, make a sling of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it to his broken hand; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as needed.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place one splint on top and another underneath the hand, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight as needed; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, put a small straight splint to raise the fracture, so that it does not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight, and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together in an "I" shape, whichever is better, or you put a splint on top, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and the treatment of a hot abscess, and help what comes there, as I have said.
The thigh bone is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns front and back;
and the restoration is that one ties one linen above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his linen to his part equally;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is near the root of the thigh, let one of the linens be towards the groin, and the other linen below the fracture.
And likewise if it is near the knee, then let the linen be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone straight with his two hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses develop there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is made in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap around the fracture a hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come up above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints on the fracture, and place a splint on the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to bind firmly three or four turns above the fracture; and the further up from the fracture you go, the less you tighten it;
then take hold of the two ends of the thread that you have placed between the leg and thigh, and tie the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, until neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it occurs, then unbind it, and treat what has appeared, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that stick out, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to split open the place, and pull it out forcefully; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in L days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is little breakage, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this is well felt.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round to its place with the fingers, until it is assembled as much as one can;
then apply the plaster, and put a round splint on it, if you need it, and bind it as is necessary, then observe all the instructions that we have mentioned for other fractures, such as a hot abscess and similar things; apply to each symptom what is needed, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "tibia", and the other is called "fibula";
and the same fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and it is clearly visible; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
however, if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, the extension must be gentler and lighter; and ease it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap two bandages around them above and below, and bind it in the middle as well, and with this binding the leg will not be able to deviate to the right or left, and so it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, which is made of wood, and the leg is placed in it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then cure it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, fracture does not occur, but at the bones of the foot fracture sometimes occurs and in the toes also, and there is nothing but a bruise in most instances.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, then have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two full sides, then bind it to the foot tightly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether they were broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board that I have mentioned, and bind it tightly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then place on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be resting on the top of the board beyond the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each accident as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, make her sit upright, then incline her to the back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the patient's vagina with cotton, and put in as much as it will hold;
then stand the woman up, and lift her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump, until it comes to the entrance of the vagina, and the bone returns with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or thereabouts: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a chain to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the vagina; then blow forcefully into the chain, until the bladder is inflated inside; the fracture will return to its place;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden from someone who studies and practices them, and attends to my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right path to restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's neck and place the penis inside it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or so, and it will be healed quickly.
Of fracture with a wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, so that the healings that we have mentioned testify to it.
And if the wound heals, restrain it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same time, or that day, if hot abscesses do not appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are subsided, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad accidents.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place lightly with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not sufficient to put it in place with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight inches long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb in your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," therefore it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even on both sides. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot well grasp the bone, then it is necessary that you cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, either an incisor or a saw, as you are able;
then scrape that which remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
Then work until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and apply it cleanly if it is summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer sutures when you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have brought about death or corrosion in the patient. And let the bandages be softer and gentler than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad consequences may come, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you should not put on sutures; but wrap around, instead of sutures, stiff cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continues to produce pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore it is necessary that you search the wound with a tent, and remove all these separated pieces which cause that pain.
And if a fistula forms at the site, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what is said in the preceding chapter.
And when the bone is broken, and open on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and others similar of the large limbs, do not extract it, for many times death ensues, but leave it until it rots;
by chance it will fall out after twenty or thirty days, then cure the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many times, after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and it is an ugly thing to see the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the bone is fresh: then administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin another, until the inflammation is removed;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation is already converted into hardness like a stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it, and remove the apparent excess; or you scrape it with a razor until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is healed, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of a multitude of washes/applications; or because of too much movement, not at the proper time; or because he has little blood in his body, so is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body supple, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws to it great nourishment, and often moisten it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish surgeons have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, it is necessary that they be bathed with warm water, or softening herbs be cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and I make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and you mix it with hen grease or linseed oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take fat figs, and crush them with pigeon dung, and similar medicines that reduce the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with wet hands. And let movement be administered to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like a stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut down to the bone, with a light, fine incisor; and put skill and diligence into the treatment.
Dislocation is the departure of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reduced without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one reduces it with difficulty to its place;
therefore it is not fitting that one moves it at the time that it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are calmed;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as its cure will come into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters of the dislocations from the head to the feet.
It rarely happens that both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: or they are a little removed from their places, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and the saliva flows from the mouth that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in many positions.
And if it is entire and complete, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a manner that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts the middle finger of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the mandible inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on two sides; and the other two fingers of the hand should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the middle finger puts it even, until it returns to its place.
And if its return is difficult, especially if it is the two mandibles together, then bathe them with warm water and oil, until you soften them gently;
do not delay in the resetting, as we have said.
And when they are reset equally, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and the patient sleeps on his back, and his head should be between two cushions, so that he does not move it neither to the right nor to the left, nor does he strain to chew, but takes light food, until the pains are gone, and the mandibles are healed;
and then he eats what he wants lightly, and does not exert himself to open his mouth when eating and drinking, until the mandible is well healed and sound.
And if the two mandibles cannot be reset at once, and are not returned to their place, then fever and accustomed swelling ensue, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a loss; and many times he who it happens to dies, within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards its connection with the ribs and breast, and it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder which is towards the rib cannot be dislocated; unless a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it in its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until healed;
and in the same way is the shoulder joint reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates to the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind because of the shoulder, and it does not dislocate inwards because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it jumps out easily;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps out with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of that.
It is necessary then that you test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lower towards the armpit, and puts a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit, on touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly on touching;
and this type of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant raises the patient's hand upwards, then places his thumbs under the armpit, and forcefully raises the joint upwards into place; and the attendant raises the hand and extends it upwards, then puts it downwards; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and the attendant [should apply] softening and soothing lotions, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then let the patient be placed on his back, and let a wool pad of equal thickness be placed under the armpit, neither too soft nor too hard, then let the physician place his heel on the pad, and raise the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pull the patient's hand;
and another attendant hold the patient's head so that it does not move downward; that shoulder returns immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and that you have present a man who is larger than the patient; and let him be straight towards the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upward, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pull the patient's hand downward towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with some heavy thing, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one sticks a long firebrand in the ground, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but so that he has soft cloths above, and the patient is standing along the length of the wood;
then let his hand be strongly extended downwards on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two spans long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter easily deep under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths on the head of the wood, so that the wood does not injure the patient, then place it under the armpit of the patient;
and extend his arm along the length of the wood, and tie the shoulder to the wood, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of suitable width, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever manner that may be, it is necessary that you place under the armpit an equal ball of wool, then apply the prepared plaster of mill dust, with incense and egg white, over and around the whole shoulder, then bind it tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to his neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And he must eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal more quickly;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, it is necessary that you administer cautery to three points, as it is set forth in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm upwards, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast and the nipples, or behind, is caused by an impact and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing, stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, then let the patient use a bath many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and it returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and if it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is broken, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before hot abscesses develop there, for if hot abscesses were to come there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be reset at all, especially when it is in the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and sometimes death results.
And the restoration is, when it is such that one can reset it, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms are spread, and the hands of the doctor around the elbow, above and below, and puts the joint to its socket together, or to the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and presses on the base of the palm near the elbow which is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the physician has joined the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint strongly until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the binding, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the binding, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you put on the joint a poultice of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and make him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then put the poultice back on, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
it will return to its proper position.
The dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the same time that it is dislocated, before the place is swollen, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the attendant extends the hand, and positions it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must look to see if it is well in place; then the patient puts the back of his hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient puts the back of his hand on the table, and the attendant puts his hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is well. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters, warm poultices, and leave it so without recommencing.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it in place after some days, the joint remains crooked;
and it harms the patient nothing except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves or arteries are severed;
there is no other remedy except to restrain it with a cautery near the case, and perhaps nothing else helps.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
then extend the finger, and push the dislocation towards its place until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or of the neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions jump forth without will, nor can he hold them, and many times some limbs are softened, either the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
that which moves to the rear is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you consider if the gibbosity came from childhood: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from percussion or similar things, the ancients spoke of cures with grand words, where there is not much profit in all;
but I have shortened it according to my understanding, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast in front, there is no remedy nor healing;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which comes properly to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched on his face in a level place, and have straw beneath him, that he not be injured;
then stick one firebrand in the ground firmly, and another at the feet, and tie one rope over the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two firebrands;
and they be well secured, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician put his feet on the other end of the board, and press well, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that turns by hand. And it is that you place two firebrands at the head of the patient at a distance of one arm's length, and towards the feet two others, and let there be between each firebrand, above and below, a hand's breadth of space in length;
and let there be in each firebrand one hole where the lathe runs, and let the firebrands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands let there be one turning firebrand, on which the ropes turn, and let there be on the two turning firebrands two small firebrands of a hand's breadth in length, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the rope that is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with all the rope, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, he puts on a drying plaster with egg white, and then the lint, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the place of the gibbosity and the healthy part of the spine, then binds it with a rope, as we have said, and the patient uses subtle nourishment, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the posterior spine of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, therefore one should not be presumptuous: by chance it would bring death.
Know that at the hip joints and at the shoulder joints there comes forth only dislocations, and not as in the other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated in four ways: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward than elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the affected leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the affected knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which occurs outwardly is that these symptoms are contrary to those above.
And the signs of that which occurs in front are that he extends his leg well according to its full length; nevertheless, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make it move, it cannot go forward, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of that which occurs behind are that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place below the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you consider if the dislocation is old, and if it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure; and it is not necessary that there be presumption.
And in one in whom the dislocation is fresh, and this is of the four types of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance it will return, and needs no other treatment.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a linen cloth tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a manner that he puts his hands under his armpits, then ties him with a soft linen cloth above the thigh; and another holds the head of the linen;
and they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar [cases], and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then it is necessary to apply a treatment similar to it.
When the dislocation is inward, you must place the patient on his healthy side, then place the linen on the root of the thigh, and the place that is below the groin, then extend the linen upwards towards the groin, and towards the collarbone;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards strongly; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot set it in this manner that we have described, then you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft linen above the two heels, and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be suspended from the top of a beam, and let it be two arms-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately and swiftly.
And when the dislocation is outward, let the patient lie down, as we have said in the case of someone with gibbosity, and tighten a linen bandage on the affected leg properly, and on the foot as well;
then place two embers, one at the head and another at the feet, then place an ember between the patient's thighs in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around, so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant stretch towards him, and let the physician put the dislocation back in place with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, put it on a table, and press it as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on the healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the physician put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, or raise it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one should press on the joint against the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are even; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and bind it tightly so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are even, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and put his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg bend to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and let the patient not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and tense towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and gently put the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is good;
If not, then begin the procedure again, for it will return;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a rope, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the physician equally set the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the sound leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and lint, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves which are on the ankle behind, that the binding not be too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the binding loosens, then tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses occur there, then you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without force, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, then you must make the patient sit on a flat place or on a straight table, and place your foot on what is exposed of those joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing appears there, then place a two-legged table under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and you have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning of things soothing hot poultices, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of healing; and when you see hope, then immediately reset the limb, before the hot poultices come there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer soothing hot poultices, and treat the wound, as is necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do as we have said in simple illnesses;
and beware of entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for that is worth more to you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and your body.
