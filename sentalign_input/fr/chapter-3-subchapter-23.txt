Here begins the book of dislocations  
A dislocation occurs when a joint is out of place, causing the limb to be misshapen and the patient to experience great pain and injury.  
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced (put back in place) immediately without delay.  
If one delays, the area will swell, and then it will be difficult to put back in place; for this reason, it should not be moved when swollen: it often causes spasms and other pains.  
However, if this happens, make the patient bleed, then leave it until the hot swelling subsides; then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently put it back, and treat each limb as necessary.  
And I have organized the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
