On the Treatment of Leg Fractures.	On setting a fracture of the leg.	0.6522112
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the two bones of the arm.	The leg consists of two bones. One of them is thick and is called 'leg bone' (tibia). The other is slender and is called 'fire-stick' (fibula).	0.8651772
Therefore, its treatment is the same as the treatment of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are broken, the leg will be twisted in all directions. If the thinner bone is broken, the leg will be twisted forward.  If the thicker bone is broken and this occurs in the lower part, it will be obvious to you.	Both of these are liable to the same kinds of fracture as occur in the two bones of the forearm, therefore the repair of them will be like that of the arm, and the operation is one and the same. If both bones are broken together, the leg will turn in all directions. If the fibula is broken there will be a forward deformity of the leg. If the tibia be broken, and that low down, it will be obvious to you.	0.8358724
So use extension and alignment, and apply splints accordingly in the same manner, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and you should be very gentle in treating it.	But it will be necessary, if the fracture of the leg be a serious one with much fragmentation, for the extension to be gentler and lighter; and you must employ the utmost gentleness in setting it.	0.70309854
There is one additional procedure for the leg compared to the arm: when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, the kind used for smoothing the ceilings which are placed between the cracks in the boards, or they can be made of palm leaf ribs or similar material.	The operation on the leg involves one more process than that on the arm, namely, that when you have set the splints and have finished the task, you should take two strips of pine wood such as are used for roofing upstairs rooms, being put in the gaps of the planking, or they may be palm stalks; pick out such as are somewhat thick and not too thin; they should be as long as the leg from the knee down.	0.7666606
Choose those that have a little thickness and are not too thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap a cloth around each one twice lengthwise and place one on the inner side of the leg and the other on the outer side.	Then wrap each of them in a cloth folded into two longitudinally, and put one on each side of the leg; they should reach from the knee to the extremity of the foot.	0.70986515
Let them extend from the knee to below the foot. Then tie the two strips together in three places: at the two ends and in the middle. By this binding, the leg is prevented from tilting right or left and is well supported.  A wooden trough along the length of the leg may also be used.	Then tie the two strips in three places, namely at the two ends and in the middle; this binding prevents the leg from bending to right or left and it will be held in a good straight position.	0.8326445
The leg is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is especially necessary if the fracture is accompanied by a wound. Then check the leg every day and take great care of it regarding swelling, inflammation, or any other such issue. Whenever any of these occur, treat them appropriately until healing is complete.  The leg bone heals in thirty days or so.	This is particularly necessary in a compound fracture. Then carefully examine the leg every day and use the utmost care to guard against effusion or swelling or other like things; and when anything of this sort happens employ the means to meet the case until it heals. The bone of the leg mends in thirty days or so.	0.91266304
