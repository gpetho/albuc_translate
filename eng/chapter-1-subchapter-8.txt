 CHAPTER EIGHT.
On cauterization for lethargy due to phlegm.
 First, great electuaries should be given to the patient to drink; and pills to clear the head.
Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters.
That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there.
If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth.
Then treat as aforesaid.
If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.
Then dress till healed.
Let the cautery be an olivary as described before.
