 CHAPTER THIRTEEN.
On the repair of fractures of the palm and fingers.
 Fractures of the metacarpus and of the small bones of the fingers very rarely occur; the only frequent occurrence is contusion.
When a fracture or crushing of the palm of the hand occurs the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of the right height in front of him, on which he should put his outstretched hand.
Then an assistant is to extend the broken bones while the doctor straightens them so as to achieve a proper union.
Then a plaster and a dressing should be applied, if an effusion do not occur; then a splint over that, measured to the site and wrapped in a soft cloth.
If the fracture be lower down, near the inner part of the palm of the hand, make a ball of cloth, bid the patient grip on it with the fractured palm of his hand, and then bind it up with a long bandage.
The splint should be of leather that is somewhat soft, so as to fit into all the folds of the palm; and bandage it on suitably.
But if the fracture be on the outside you will have to put one splint above and another beneath the palm of the hand, to keep the hand opened and straight; then put on the bandage, carrying it round the hand and in and out between the fingers.
 The fracture may occur to one of the small bones of the fingers.
If it be the thumb, then set it in the proper way and bind it down to the palm of the hand; if you like you can apply a small straight splint to it to keep the fracture straight so that it does not shift.
If the break be in any of the other fingers, such as the middle or index or little finger or the ring finger, straighten it out and bind it to the sound finger next to it; or let them all be bound up one to another, which is better; or apply a small straight splint, as we said for the thumb.
While you are setting it, and afterwards, look out for an effusion and counteract it with what is required if anything of this sort occur, according to what has been repeatedly prescribed.
