The author of this book said: When I completed for you, my son, this book, which is the theoretical part of medicine in its entirety, and reached the limit in its clarity and explanation, I decided to complete it for you with this treatise, which is the practical part, because practical work and its practitioners are completely nonexistent in our country and in our time, so that its knowledge almost disappeared and its impact vanished.	AFTER finishing for you, my sons, this book which is the part of knowledge dealing with medicine in its entirety; and having made it as clear and explicit as possible, I thought it well to complete it for you by adding this treatise which concerns surgical operating. For the skilled practitioner of operative surgery is totally lacking in our land and time; so that the knowledge of it is on the point of being blotted out and its remains lost; and there is nothing left of it except a few traces in the books of the Ancients; where, however, it has been so corrupted by the hands of scribes, and subjected to error and confusion, that its meaning has become obscured and its value diminished.	0.70847714
Only minor traces of it remained in the books of the predecessors, which have been distorted by hands and affected by errors and confusion, so that its meanings became obscure and its benefit distant, so I decided to revive it and compose this treatise in the way of explanation, clarification, and brevity, and to provide images of cautery irons and other surgical instruments, as this is an addition to the explanation and among the most important things needed.	For the skilled practitioner of operative surgery is totally lacking in our land and time; so that the knowledge of it is on the point of being blotted out and its remains lost; and there is nothing left of it except a few traces in the books of the Ancients; where, however, it has been so corrupted by the hands of scribes, and subjected to error and confusion, that its meaning has become obscured and its value diminished. Therefore I decided to revive this art by expounding, elucidating, and epitomizing it in this treatise; and to present the forms of the cauterizing irons and other operative instruments, since this is an adjunct to explanation and a vital necessity.	0.8328652
The reason why there is no skilled practitioner in our time is that the study of medicine is long, and its student should be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy described by Galen, until he understands the benefits of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections, separations, knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and exits, and the pulsating and static veins, and the locations of their exits.	Now this is the reason why there is no skilful operator in our day: the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its exponent, before he exercises it, to be trained in anatomy as Galen has described it, so that he may be fully acquainted with the uses, forms, and temperament of the limbs; also how they are jointed, and how they may be separated; that he should understand fully also the bones, tendons, and muscles, their numbers and their attachments; and also the bloodvessels, both arteries and veins, with their relations.	0.86553496
Therefore, Hippocrates said that doctors are many in name but few in practice, especially in surgery.	And so Hippocrates said: 'Though many are doctors in name, few are in reality, particularly on the surgical side.'	0.86688924
We have mentioned some of this in the introduction of this book, because whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned of anatomy will inevitably fall into an error that kills people with it, as I have seen many of those who imagined themselves knowledgeable in this science and claimed it without knowledge or skill.	We have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book. For he who is not skilled in as much anatomy as we have mentioned is bound to fall into error that is destructive of life. Thus I have seen many laying claim to this knowledge and boasting of it, but having neither knowledge nor experience.	0.8170083
This is because I saw an ignorant doctor who incised a scrofulous swelling in a woman's neck, so he pierced some of the arteries of the neck, and the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.	I saw an ignorant doctor incise a scrofulous tumour in a woman's neck; and he cut certain arteries in the neck so that the woman bled until she fell dead before him.	0.8534076
And I saw another doctor who proceeded to extract a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the bladder, and the stone was large, so he rushed and extracted it with a piece of the bladder, so the man died after about three days.	And I saw another doctor presume to take out a stone from a man of advanced age. The stone was large; he rushed blindly at the task and extracted the stone and with it a piece of the bladder itself; and the man was dead in about three days.	0.894428
I was called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient what I estimated about it.	I had myself been previously called in to extract the stone but from what I saw of the size of it and the condition of the patient I judged that the outcome would be so.	0.7756498
And I saw another doctor who cauterized a cancerous tumor, so it ulcerated after days until his affliction worsened, and this is because if cancer is purely of melancholic humor, then it should not be exposed to iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can be completely amputated.	And I saw another doctor incise a malignant tumour; after some days the place broke out in open ulceration, thereby adding to the misery of the patient. For a cancer that arises from a melancholic humour should never be touched by the knife unless it should happen to be in a part of the body which may be removed thoroughly and in its entirety.	0.8166898
Galen said in some of his advice: Do not treat a bad disease, so you are called bad doctors.	For Galen once said in certain of his admonitions: 'Do not treat mischievous maladies lest you get the name of mischievous doctors.'	0.85220146
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.	I have divided this treatise into three books:	0.9002188
The first chapter is about cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, organized and arranged from head to toe, with images of instruments, cautery irons, and everything needed for surgery.	BOOK ONE. Concerning the actual cautery; and cauterization by caustics. It is divided into chapters set in order from the head to the feet. The shapes of the instruments are shown and the iron cauteries and all things necessary for operating.	0.7021238
The second chapter is about incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, removing arrows, and so on, all organized and arranged with images of instruments.	BOOK TWO. Concerning incision and perforation; blood-letting and cupping; wounds and the extraction of arrows and the like. The whole is divided into chapters in order; and illustrations of instruments are given.	0.73964244
The third chapter is about bone setting, dislocations, treatment of tendons, and so on, organized and arranged from head to toe with images of instruments.	BOOK THREE. Concerning the setting of bones; dislocations; the treatment of sprains and the like. This is similarly divided into chapters set in order from head to feet, with illustrations of instruments.	0.77436197
