O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its expositions and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is weakened in our region and is completely estranged, the science is lost and fragmented, and nothing remains of it except the brief descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and the science is alienated.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the arrangement of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will bring together the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work, with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good master of hands is found in our time, the art of medicine is elongated. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the judgment of the members, and their forms and conjunctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement of the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason, Hippocrates says that the name without the deed is much, and with the deed is little; and similarly in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things mentioned above, let him beware lest he fall into error and kill men;
as I have seen many times many of those who meddle in this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish surgeon who cut an abscess of scrofula on the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another surgeon who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he took away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew that if it were cut he would die.
And I saw another surgeon who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the surgeon, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture through the wound with a strong ligature, and left no drainage for the wound, and left it thus for some time;
and ordered him not to untie it;
and it remained thus until the leg was completely swollen and the foot, and it came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and untie the leg; and when I had untied it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But nevertheless, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another case where an abscess was opened, and then inflamed by the malice of its lord.
For a cancerous sore, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it is not necessary to touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove everything that is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, it is necessary that you know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in many situations;
and I will show in each part of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard yourselves, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your instruments carefully, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that through God's grace you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to severe suffering;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonishments: Do not take on a bad illness unless you are called a fool.
I have devised this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is of fire cauteries and of cauteries of liquid medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of the instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and of similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and subtle science and the hidden secrets;
and of this the many wise men spoke, and agreed to this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some have debated and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the opposite: that cautery is of no use for illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the opposite said that cautery greatly helps hot and dry illnesses that occur in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it so sometimes by experiment.
And yet, let no one meddle with it except he who has tested it, and who knows by long usage the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the space of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all the learned men assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not go forth except to the member which is cooked, and harms no other member except very little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and bring to the member diseases of difficult healing; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its heat and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is superfluity.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have devoted to the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I apologize for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to withhold from you the secret that is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels diseases from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on when cauterizations should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the resulting harm is overcome by the help of cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, and urgent pains that cannot wait until greater harm comes to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as foolish doctors do; for a disease that is cured by cautery does not return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they think, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than other medicines because of the speed of its action, and because of the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the disease sometimes returns according to the patient's complexion and the location of the disease and its virulence;
and superfluities are gathered there by the consumption of food and similar things, unless cautery is administered where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as dental cautery for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and this is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for a disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that a cautery instrument of gold is better than one of iron, and they did not say this without reason, but because of the quality of gold and the excellence of its substance;
and they said that the cauterized area does not become putrid, but this is not true because I have tested it, and I have found that it is true in some people;
and a gold cautery is better than one of iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools down immediately;
and if one heats it too much; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to toe, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made because of an illness that is called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and because of a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and also for all illnesses that come from coldness, such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is such that the patient should be purged with a purgative medicine purifying the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and habit of the patient can endure; and then shave the patient's head.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his thighs;
afterwards place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers will come, bleed from there then heat the cautery which is called "olive", of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move it downwards and inwards, little by little, turning your hand. Then lift your hand quickly, and observe the place to see if you see the bone, even a little; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
Afterwards, take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and apply it to the place, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards, apply cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is healed; Afterwards, treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses; and therefore it helps to move.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it is healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and apply it so strongly that one burns away from the bone as wide a hole as the whorls that women put in their spindles, so that the humors may issue out more freely;
and one should leave the wound open a long time; afterwards one should treat and dress it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be altogether good in all cases, except in some men where there is reason to fear;
and more it seems to me that I ought to leave it there;
for the head is weakened by the continuous discharges of nature, as we witness in other members;
and likewise when the patient's head is weak by nature, and the first form of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and of that I use the work then together with safety.
When chronic pain comes in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills which are called "cochie", and head purgation, and oils, and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have said before, and it is of no use. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize a little below that cautery we spoke of above. Afterwards make a cautery on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place which is called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping glasses are applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not reach to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the horns be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the head cautery When a sudden pain comes in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the other treatments that I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not help: then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it a little at the two ends, and then split the temple where the pain is located in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, tie it and bind it well and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then untie it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until pus comes out.
Afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is in this manner. Heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is made in the shape of a bell or it has a little curvature, and in the middle has a small opening;
and put it on the painful area, and hold your hand and twist the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and an abundance of blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in salt water, and put it on the area for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter there, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "cultellare," with the whole point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery that is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus on the aching area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful that you do not cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should only be considered if it moves and that a spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, especially to one who is not knowledgeable, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments which we have mentioned in the division have been tried, and the pain does not cease, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
Then prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place to be punctured; and let there be ten punctures around each ear;
afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
Of the torture of the mouth
A torture which ought to be cured by cautery is none other than that which comes from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not apply cautery to those similar things which come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this kind of torture which comes from phlegm, with purges and head washes and gargles, and this is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the part which appears healthy, and make the cautery towards the head of the ear a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the spoon we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after, cure the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place which is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be cured as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
then shave the patient's head completely, and apply to the occiput the mustard plaster which is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space between each cautery of one thumb's breadth;
and cure it as the others, and if you wish to add, and the patient is able to bear it, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and cure it until it is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of that which we have said before;
after shaving the head of the patient, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; after treat it until it is healed, and let it be the cautery which is called "olivare" that we have said before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain of humors and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is strong and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, give him gargles and mastication frequently cleansing the brain with good foods;
then raise the head in the middle, and make one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and able to endure it, make cauteries as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped in the manner that I have described.
If the patient is a child, make one small cautery in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or humors are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are leaning towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink to cleanse the brain, according to what is described earlier in the division.
Then shave the patient's head; then make a linen pad, well-made, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then present the liniment, and it is worth using old sheep butter; and heat it by fire moderately, so that the finger, if one puts it in, can endure it; then empty the circle inside on the head, and let it cool;
and do this for the patient once each week along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, making several punctures throughout the cautery.
This method of cautery moistens the brain equally;
and then apply moistened cotton in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and protect it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and cauterize him in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the whole cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself against the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood issue, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery is made or applied under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have said in the beginning of the descending water to the eyes: I cautery in the middle of the head, and II cauteries on the II temples, and II cauteries on the nape of the neck under the II bones; and if there is more need, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and he does not improve, then give the patient to drink three nightshade berries; after shave the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries of the cautery which is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the shape of the cautery which is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the shape:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave your hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair which pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inwards, and prick the eye, and cauterization is done in two ways: that is to say, by fire, or by a burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, then the patient puts [them] in your hand; Afterwards, draw on the skin with the eyes a figure like the leaf of the myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs;
then put cotton moistened in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
After that, cauterize on the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the skin is burned in that place;
And the sign of the success of the work is that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter there until the burn is removed; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after that the hairs come, and the skin is softened, then begin the cautery again on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are weak, then cauterize until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one-third, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the skin; and if the disease is in one eye only, then one should work on one, and if in both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be on your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it burns like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the area with water, and observe if you see the membrane raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, apply more medicine to the area where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are focused;
then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burnt skin falls off, afterwards treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard well your work with great care that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the scab becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick the eye, then reapply the medicine to that area which is softened by the scab properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, both large and small, and according to that should be your restraints;
and the right way should not be denied to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move, nor does he shake his head;
then place moistened cotton in egg white or parsley juice on the eye;
afterwards heat the cautery which is like this:
and is shaped at the head like the form of a vulture's feather, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
however, the one that is shaped like this is better for your work.
Afterwards, press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the corruption, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the pus;
afterwards apply the hot cautery very strongly, and hold your hand on the cautery at the part of the hip above the eye, so that your hand does not waver; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a corrosive liquid medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what is found in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients mentioned. Attend to the fistula, and incise the place; afterwards place in the incision one small cauterizing iron of which this is the form: and it is made to the quantity of a third of a lead weight; and hold your hand with the cauterizing iron firmly, and the patient should not move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, then it is necessary to administer a probe to the nose, and to return the fistula to the body of the nose according to what is necessary in its proper place.
of cracks in the lips Very often cracks in the lips occur which are called "chapped lips," and similarly in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the sections, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess forms in the root of the throat or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it forms pus and bursts and is aged and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the sections, and it does not improve: then it is necessary that you apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and the last place;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment that we have described in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it does not work, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery, whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterwards lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your will;
afterwards let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this manner the tooth which was loose is fixed, and the softened gum is restrained, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from cold, or there is cold or worm, and medical cures are ineffective, then cautery is needed in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow butter, and put the end in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and apply it to the aching tooth, and apply a hot iron until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze cane, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
then heat the cautery, of which the shape will come later, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then rinse it strongly;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whichever head you wish, and according to what you have power;
and this is the shape of the chain:
of the scrofula When the scrofula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the form follows below, and it should have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it like that for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When the humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold constitution, then it is necessary that the patient first be purged by solutive medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach the throat, and not to burn near the heart but only a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery be that which is called "clavile" of which we have the form before;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When all or a disease of the lungs are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the disease is old, apply two cauteries to the clavicle in empty places; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavile" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the entire cautery which is called "points," the form of which is given above, in the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After treating the area according to what is said above, and let the cautery have three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at once.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is inside the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, then heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for this reason a cautery is made with the cautery which has three nerves, because of which the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, because of which there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, apply the cautery with crushed parsley and salt; afterwards make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture come into the stomach so that they alter its complexion, and catarrh is multiplied in it, and the usual methods of treatment do not help, then the patient must be seated on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make three cauteries: one under the hollow of the breast the size of a finger, with the entire clavicle cautery, and two cauteries outside on the two sides so that the shape of the cauteries is triangular, and there is such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point according to the amount you wish to draw blood; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is cured by what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be bled on his arm; and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the ribs of the man come;
and let there be between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be the length of the body, and do not press your hand very much on the whole cautery;
and let only half of the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your will, cauterize these cauteries with the cauterizing iron, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach boiling point, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and know this for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment fails, the patient must be bled above his head;
and then bleed from the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which this is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it reaches down to the fascia, until the perforation is completely through;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of burns, until it is healed;
And it is not fitting that anyone use this cautery except one who has studied medicine for a long time, and through whose hands these diseases have passed.
Then he can boldly work, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
Of the cautery for pleurisy.
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of the roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a root of long aristolochia, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and grind it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize with the cautery between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the area below the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a fire cautery like a razor, and heat it and put it between the ribs until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this procedure there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops which cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse according to what we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cautery which are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three or four cauteries, in a line according to the length of the mouse, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have described before;
and do not press your hand on the whole cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two points, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is near the mouse, or the side of the patient which is towards the left, and let the elevations by which you lift the heart be along the heart, along the length of the body, and let the cauteries be along the width of the body.
Afterwards, thrust the two burning points until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then draw out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three points.
After the treatment, when it has discharged pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned above.
Cautery is of no use for a dropsical person, except in the manner which is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the sections, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one above the stomach, and one above the liver, and one above the spleen, and two on the back above the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the care of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the little nail that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is set forth above.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is dropsical, and are full of citrine water, you should cauterize on the top of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not go in too deep, lest the citrine water be burned away, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on the two legs two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without cleaning, so that the water may come out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by methods of treatment; and you see the patient is well-bearing and of strong virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of above concerning the cautery of the stomach, a circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the navel with one small claviform cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the cure of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and are cured as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those which are completely outside below the armpit little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel two fingers;
And if you think that his stomach is cooled, and the food does not cook, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the entire cautery burning-hot; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then put it, all burning, on that cut thelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards cure it with beneficial ointments until it is healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness arises that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupt moisture, you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and make sure you know the depth of the tent completely.
Afterwards, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to how far the tent entered, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need;
and beware of burning the nerves which are within, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply the fire except in fleshy areas, and intend that it is not penetrating;
afterwards treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the materials have been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the materials are not removed, know that the area is pierced, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted; and in the same way as one of those that we will describe in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and he does not desire women, then it is necessary that you apply cautery to the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery we have previously described;
and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then apply cautery to the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a thumb;
and apply one cautery to the back outside, or two if you need it;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the form previously described.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers (menses) are corrupted and their timing is delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back;
and let the cauteries be deeply burned, as we have said.
When viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient over the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is within the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of the size of an olive, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the fingers;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and wide, and have between each cautery the space of the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, wherefore there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have mentioned before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the marrow of the bone is burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not reach down to the thigh or to the leg.
And if it reaches to the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, on the left side a little;
and let the cautery be spoon-shaped, and let the thickness of the bone be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or near them, cauterize where he feels the pain, three or four points with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more for him;
and if he knows that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with a spoon-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and the large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have had cautery applied to the ankle of the foot, and it was left on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery in one and in the other, according to this manner.
And the wise men said, in the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let it be at the head as thick as a date-stone, or a little less, and let it be between the ribs and let it be from one rib to the other a space the quantity of a thumb-joint;
and let the ribs be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then put it on the hip-joint of the diseased side, and let it be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and yet it is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with notches in which the edge of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long side, and in height it should have two fingers, and between each have the thickness of a finger; and they should be open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
Then place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very hard on the box on the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles hot water which has been heated on the fire a little, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For it finds a burning there as from fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip with fresh water, and leave it so for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it three days so that the pus is drawn out;
and this would be the last aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has spread to the thigh or to the leg, make an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it; and put on top of that pot another pot well sealed, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is about two fingers depth above the powders when you have pressed it well with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is administered in many medical procedures and in cauterizations of other limbs.
For it does the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and honey of anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen recounts a cure by which a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and praises it highly, and says that no other cure was performed, and that he was healed at once when this cure was performed, and he bathed himself as he teaches hereafter.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it finely with one handful of fat, and apply it to the hip, thigh, and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, and in the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is somewhat warmed, and make him enter the bed, and all the pain will leave and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines unless it is after the evacuation of humors.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow which is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called the foscile.
Afterwards take dry goat dung, and heat it in the fire until it is coals, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in this way, and do not cease doing so until you think by feeling that it reaches the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this manner of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from a fall or from a blow or from too great an evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these cases is cautery worthwhile, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of fetid pills or similar things, that three lines are made on his back, where the pain is located, marked with ink, and in each line five cauteries or more, according to the strength and the quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be made according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries with the middle nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other.
Afterwards, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not administer cautery in a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints.
When joint pain is from moisture that is spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the learned properly call "podagra," and when it is of cold cause and cures by medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you cauterize on the face of the foot, make for it a cautery with the whole cautery which one calls "point". And if the pains reach to the knees and to the other joints, and this happens many times, make for it cauteries on each knee, three or four cauteries on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand there except until the thickness of the skin is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer to it the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist, two lines;
and if some pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the palm of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend to the testicles and it is recent, it is necessary that when you wish to cure it, he not eat that day; and that he use things that loosen the belly, so that the feces descend from his belly;
Afterwards, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are returned, and push them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and with a mark that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and emits sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return;
and open the patient's thighs well, and place under him one cushion and one assistant on the thighs, and another on the chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, repeat it again until you reach the bone; and guard subtly that the bowel does not protrude when you apply the cautery; lest you burn it; and that thereby the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small according to their size, and for adults large according to their size;
after three days, treat the site of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well sealed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that his bowels do not swell when he tries to go to the privy.
And after forty days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and let him wear it for another forty days;
and let him have good rest, that he works little and guards against too great repletion of drink and food, and too loud laughter;
and when he has followed this instruction he is completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they do not grow any more, make a cautery with the cautery iron according to its size, and let a third of the heart be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery head.
But the first cautery is lighter and better.
of old pain in any limb When pain comes in any limb, from a fall or a wound, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery that is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
If he is healed by the first cautery, it is good;
if not, begin another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it must move to the limb that is near it, wherefore it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great help, and likewise the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take heed if the disease is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you fear that the corruption will seize the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape;
and let your hand go so far that the cautery reaches to the bone, and so that the scabs come out so that the vapors of the gross humors can issue forth;
and cauterize on the spleen according to what is before.
And if the leprosy is scattered everywhere; and it appears manifestly, then you must cauterize it with those cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the bridge of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and one other nearby, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the flanks, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits;
and know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find it in the types of irons.
After, cure the place with bean flour with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When an inflammation comes in any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be a little deep into the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the inflammation is removed;
and yet no one should interfere unless he is knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the illness that is called "albaras" is chronic, and the means of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery somewhat deeply, according to the thickness of the heart, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and let it remain there until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the circumference of the cancer.
And yet the wise say that one should also cauterize the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular", as we have said in many cauterizations.
When someone has an illness that is called "adubelati", and it delays maturing either because of the superfluity it produces or because of the patient's age when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the time; and you see it hasten to mature: then cauterize it around with many small, piercing cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you see it pierce through the entire cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it externally in such a way that the course of the corruption is alleviated.
Afterwards cure it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it eats away the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can endure cautery with fire, then heat the cautery pins, small and large, according to what is necessary for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized places crushed sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Afterward, treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good;
and if not, then begin cauterization again on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this disease has sometimes been cured by liquid medicine instead of fire cautery;
but nevertheless, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with liquid medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come on the feet Very often it happens that on the feet a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, swollen thing that injures the foot.
And the cauterization of this disease is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just as if it were a goose feather, and let it be made of good iron, in such a measure that it can surround the nail on all sides, and that it have fine edges;
afterwards put it, very hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it so for three days until it begins to shed pus; then make a plaster of crushed wild mallows with oil, and leave the plaster on all night, and the nail will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are inverted on the outside of the body, and this often happens in the hands and feet, then you must apply a hot water cautery; and it is in this manner: take a chain of brass or iron, or a goose feather, and place it on the nail and the althelul, that is to say, warts; and place the chain so that it encompasses it entirely, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root;
and let the patient suffer the bite of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be uprooted completely with all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the foot, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery;
this will stop the trembling, and will hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
if it is necessary at the first appearance that one makes a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held in the fire, or of the root of long birthwort, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow any further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there are great flows of blood from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from a blow, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very serious thing to staunch.
And however when this happens to someone, quickly put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard so that the blood is stopped under your finger, and that no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after the other until the blood is stanched;
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stanch it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not drawn out, or by tight binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stanch blood; and let it be bound and constricted tightly.
He who attempts staunching by tightly binding with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will benefit little, if at all.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a remedy or medicine present, he should place his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it with cold water often, that it be very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and then do what is necessary with cautery and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all illnesses in which it is necessary to cauterize with fire, or with burning medicine, and the occasions and the causes and the instruments and the forms of cautery;
and I placed that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will go in this chapter by that same method so that one finds more easily what one wants.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there is often evacuation of blood in opening the vein, and in the incision upon an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision upon the stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you that you do not undertake folly. For many kinds of people come to treatments. so some come who are so afflicted with their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they find in their illness, and because of its great malice; and of these one must be afraid.
And among these there are some who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but place greater trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely on that of which you are certain, and from which you can have profit and praise;
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients to which health may be converted;
and this will help you to acquire good reputation, and glory, and memory of praise.
Most dear son, May Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in sections, according to what is before in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described for you from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife pulls the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen, death was swift; and for that reason it seems to me better to leave the work in such cures.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day so much that he could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone on the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you cut into the head a wide incision;
and let it be as long as two fingers, so that the moisture runs out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more abundant, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it with your hand from the inside, and this is not restored: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw all the moisture out. Afterwards, dress the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be bandaged evenly, and give the patient dry meat with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe where the size of the abscess is apparent, and the collection of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and incise it according to your ability;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the disease is old, and the treatment of medicine does not help, then the last resort is cautery, with which one will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary, then, when you want to cut them, that the patient tilts his head back; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with the cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the location of one and the other is behind the ears, and they are somewhat hidden;
then mark the locations with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula on both sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if there remains a point of the sheath on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms there, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and an old, raging headache and similar things, and it is treated by various medical methods and none of this helps, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should push back the hair from his temples, and attend to the artery which appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is scarcely hidden except in some men who are very cold;
and if it is hidden, let the patient pull his neck with some cloths, then rub the place with some rough cloth, and bathe the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then draw it upwards with the forceps, and separate it well from the tissues which are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is small, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the quantity of the two ends. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow completely.
And draw out six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that corruption does not come before the closing of the wound, and there will be continuous bleeding;
then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a cuticular cautery to the bone until the ends are cut;
and this is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up the humors: therefore it is of greater help for humors.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place well-made tents on top;
and when they are untied, let it be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize it, or you fill the place with vitriol and restrain it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and sprinkle the place with cold water until the bleeding stops, and it is extracted as it should be;
And it should have between the two knives one finger's breadth of thickness, and then when you have marked the two places, and you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two ends because it is not entirely cauterized in its entirety;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is milder and lighter in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the edges should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are above the skull of the head of fire, and no medicinal cure benefits it, and you see the face of the patient redden, and he feels an itching in the forehead like a tremor; and his eye is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and scorched by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contused cure", and it is that you should shave the hairs that he has on the forehead for the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused cure", and it is that you should shave the hairs that he has on the forehead for the patient who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers across the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three fingers across joined together;
and have prepared a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe the blood, then put the sharp spatula on the two sides of which this is the shape:
from the incision that is near the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the skin that is between the two incisions to the whole surface that is on the bone, then do likewise from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula. then put into the first incision the instrument which is called a "cultellary", and is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side towards the raw flesh, and the smooth side towards the bone, and put it in until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to that which appears of the skin, and then likewise do in the middle incision to the other outside;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against hot abscesses coming there;
and on the third day untie the ligature, and administer there a great plenty of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one cures wounds, until it is healed.
When to some comes an acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and the sight weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is a sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these matters and that catarrh do not come forth except from many veins, and the best cure that there is, is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another of the width of a finger. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move during eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the incision and put old cotton and linen tents there; then bind on top cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to make flesh grow everywhere.
Of the stopping up of the ears
Whatever falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or similar thing such as iron; or seeds, such as lentils, beans, peas; or a flowing substance such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing that does not adhere to the ear or grow in the ear falls into the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, instill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then proceed with extraction; and make him sneeze with hellebore, and stuff his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and hold the ear upward.
Often, healing comes through this treatment;
and if healing does not come, administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it comes out with forceps, that is good;
if not, administer extraction with a fine probe of small diameter;
and if it does not come out by this, make a chain of bronze and place the head of the chain in the opening of the ear strongly, and stuff that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out strongly, for very often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, take birdlime, and put on it some instrument which is sharp for doing this, and place a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, hasten to cut open the ear before a warm abscess and spasm come;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear at the fatty tissue or the dependent part; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it out hastily with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist due to the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it;
then extract it with fine tweezers and a sucker, as we have said, so that the extraction is easy.
Then, in the case of water falling into the ear, the patient should first use a sternutatory, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on the same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take many stones according to the length of your middle finger, and light ones, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet from the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out, and in this way it all jumps out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and take hold of the other end with fire until the most of the reed is burned;
then do likewise with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is of small body, such as a flea and similar things, cure it as we have said in the division;
but if it is of large body that one can feel it, then administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms engendered in the ears, when you cure it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the cure does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear there, draw them out with fine pincers, and if they do not appear, then take the candle of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the most slender end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole candle; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey and come out, then stuff around the candle with cotton as I have said in the case of the stone;
and if they do not readily come out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have tested in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and then distil your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside with a well-made bronze instrument for this purpose, and if you wish take a rasp and wrap cotton neatly around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines, into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then put in the rasp with the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be a little warmed by the fire before it is distilled into the ear; and take care that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born who have no opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through the blocking of a wound, or of flesh grown inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes comes deep into the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly blocked, and one sees it well.
That which comes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many cases, and in that which one sees it is necessary that you place the ear of the patient in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of raw flesh or body of the ear, then hold it with fine forceps, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is entirely removed.
And if the obstruction is deep in the ear, then take a thin, light rasp and heat it slightly in the fire, then put it into the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and take care that you do not injure the nerves of the ear;
then put into the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for a few days until the wound is healed, or you take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and sprinkle on crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and insert another tent moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then cure it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that stop the bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.
These styes that come on the eyelids when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them with a spatula from their roots; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin lenticular cautery, and cauterization after incision is useful;
and often they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Often, paper-like things appear in the eyes, resembling hail in form and hardness, and therefore this disease is called "hail," and is a collection of thick moisture in the paper above and below; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe whether the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision wide, then lightly scrape each part, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the membrane a little, it does no harm to the patient;
and if the fissure is large, bring it together with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, apply no force, for ointments restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the membrane, and grasp the hailstone with forceps, and cut and press it on one side and the other;
and if the membrane is separated by the incision, it does no harm;
and when the hailstone is cut, apply a drop of salt water, and treat the place with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease that is generated in the webs of the membranes above, and this happens more to children than to any people, and it greatly harms their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they always lie on their faces, and sleep on them, and their membranes under their eyebrows are moist because the swelling and the appearance have covered the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains exinach of each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and let it not be greater than the wound that one makes to bleed a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several instances exinach comes from the fissure, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extract it then in one piece with a piece of lint between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand to right and left until it is separated;
and take care that you do not insert into the fissure, that you do not bring the whole spatula right to the eye, that you do not wound it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the fissure, slightly enlarge the fissure a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt that moisture which has remained.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears in the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the testicles When hairs grow on the testicles in addition to the natural ones, and are neglected, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases such as habitual tearing and softening of the testicles and albuginea, to the point of causing their destruction;
and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by a sharp medicine, according to what is written before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cauterization, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the testicle with your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then put a needle with thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the testicle where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread over it with the testicle, and turn it to the smoother side;
then cut in the part under the testicle, under the attached hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear to the small;
then pull out the thread, and put under the testicle a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the testicle a figure of an anchor, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you want to raise the testicle which is divided in two.
And if there is someone who needs to cut a large quantity of the testicle according to how the testicle is softened;
then cut with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear down to the small; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then put the oncin in one of the two angles of the heart, then peel it all;
then join the two lips with a suture of a needle with a very fine woolen thread, and wipe away the blood, and cut off the superfluous threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting things, for the skin rises at the bottom of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients said), and this is work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you cut the skin in a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, three inches apart according to the shape which is here:
then cut what is above with small, equal forces according to the shape which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the forceps, and the thing is not equal, then take a needle with a thread, and put it in the middle of the figure; and put one other thread near the large tear, and the second thread near the small one, and bring together the threads equally between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have cut, as we have described, then bring together the two edges of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess forms at your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the scrotum are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of cankers is according to this form: and it is that you invert the scrotum and slit it inside as I have said, and then make two cankers by art, and two fine ligatures as long as the scrotum and as wide as the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then carefully join one and the other above what protrudes from the scrotum, and tightly squeeze the two cankers from the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is squeezed will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it is slow, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is sealed, and the scrotum is lifted, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two cankers that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then bring together the ends and tie them subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the cavity another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then let the patient place his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for this is a subtle and delicate procedure, then put the needle with the thread into the root of the added hair, and pierce it into the skin quickly until you pull it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the cavity, and put that hair into the cavity, whether there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the cavity into the skin along with the natural hair.
And if the cavity is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the cavity downwards with all the thread that you have placed there, until the cavity comes out of the hole above and you can see it with your eyes;
then you will pull out the cavity and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair grows back in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, then attach a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with that one or leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this illness which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes to the eye, there are two kinds:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens suddenly from a wound, or a cut or a cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that weld, and separate its lips, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do that, the illness returns worse than before;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rose water or mallow and linseed boiled, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent around it, and cure it with that.
And the treasure of your cure is that you take care that it does not heal according to the form it was before;
and these operations that we have mentioned are nothing but treatments for this illness, so that it does not return according to the form it was before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accidental [occurrence] comes from a wound and from a fissure and from a cautery and from similar things;
and the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it to a width of one finger. And if the shape of the skin returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the skin, and make two fissures on the side within the skin;
and let the ends of the two fissures be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter which is called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its sides are sharp underneath, from that which follows the skin, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then cure it with what we have said of mollifying medicines, and of tents, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a fissure or a suture or a cautery, then you must make a deep incision under the hairs of the skin, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares a remedy with all his power so that he may restore the figure to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is needed in work and instruments in various situations.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the skin above is adhered with the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the skin, and lift it up;
and extend it with forceps, until you cut what is attached with a thin spatula, which is neither too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer that the too sharp spatula injure the eye;
and let your incision, with which you remove that adhesion, be light, so that the skin returns to its natural form;
and is healed all that adhesion, and sometimes they make in the eye salted water, and wash it with fresh water, and with whey;
then place between the skin and the eye a linen tent, and put on the eye wool moistened in egg white; and after the third day use whey and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to hard tissue, and another which is not nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and thinks to pierce it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the larger tear duct, and grow little by little until it covers all the sight and all the light and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with small double forceps, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it into the eyelid, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the eyelid with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the eyelid that follows the pupil and the silk with the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the fine spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh at the tear duct, so that the flow of tears is not impeded by the incision;
and sometimes the eyelid is stretched only with the hook and the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a smooth spatula of which this is the shape:
And take care that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put in the eye a little crushed salt, and of the eyewash made from litharge, and leave it until the next day; then cure it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the curette cannot enter, many times this type of nail is cured with medicines;
and they grow as I have recounted in the division, and if you see it needs cutting, open the patient's eye, and take a light, sharp spatula in this shape: And scrape the nail from above subtly, and if you see that it diminishes little by little and the scraping is pressing it, then distil from your mouth into the eye an eyewash made from litharge and the red eyewash and crushed salt, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is hindering you in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then resume the work as before, until it is healed.
then resume the other work according to this same method, until it is all removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye by great annoyance, then suspend it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all of it, so that the tear duct is not affected;
then distil into the eye red eyewash which is made from litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and covers the pupil and extends over the eyelids and turns them inside out, and resembles a pomegranate rose;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you pull all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and support it with force;
then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be with the spatula that we have described in the incision of the nail and for small growths from which one removes a wart, as the figure after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, apply crushed sel oil or distill red copperas and similar corrosive medicines on it, and place cotton over the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overcomes you, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and do so whenever flesh is added to the eye in this way.
However, it is necessary that you alleviate the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, with iron instruments;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the limb can endure that operation.
There are red veins that are spread over the eye, and they hinder its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary, then, first that you see if the eye in which the sebel is, is sound, and there is no other illness except the sebel; then treat the eye in this manner:
instruct the patient to put his head in your lap, then cut those veins with the lancet according to your skill, and let the lancet be sharp and double according to this form:
And let there be two lancets by degrees in one body according to this form:
then one treats forcefully those veins subtly, and the blood flows out one after another, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, then instill in the eye green and red copperas to corrode what remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to remove all of it at that time, then make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is soothed and the hot abscess is certain, then begin again in this manner which is before until it is healed;
and this is the method of treatment:
The physicians call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with a sharp burning medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then the method is that you cut open the abscess where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it all away with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head", and it should be made of iron with one round head, and it should be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the spot of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that this corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew itself and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to return the fistula to the hole of the nose according to this form: and that is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of the iron be three-angled, and the shaft be tapered to the point as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; it is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no obstruction or narrowing of the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses or a leech without wounding to draw out the humor, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia and aloe and incense and sarcocol, and then bandage the eye, and plaster it with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take soft cloths, and fold each one into four, and then place one upon another according to the quantity that the eye needs;
then bind it over with a strong bandage, and repeat the cupping to draw out the humor without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night, and if the liniment softens, you must bind it very tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and a night, and if you see the eye improving, that is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the liniment and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of the uvula. When a rupture occurs in the uvula, then it opens, and there comes forth a discharge of papules like grains of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see it severed, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper part, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle in place;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the uvula around it, and pull it tightly, then remove the needle and apply wool soaked in egg white.
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvula, then treat the area with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvula on each side with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives a great appearance, pierce it with a thin spatula that goes deep into the eye, and break up the white moisture and let the eye descend, and it will enter immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling which is gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the operation is such that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top to your eyes; then let it be pierced, and let the light not descend and be obscured, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and make an incision on the corneal membrane a little, by the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the cornea, until the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, then distill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then let it be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have already the appearances of the waters in the division, and what is necessary for piercing; then work according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and bind it very tightly;
then put the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the cornea by the thickness of a ray in that white of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" vigorously, and turn your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda path be at the depth of the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal tissue, and then place the instrument to where the water is, then press it out one way after another.
If the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards, rest a little, and if the water rises the second way, place the force with the instrument, and when it is fixed inside and it does not rise, then extract the almagda lightly by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little rock salt in water, and wash the eye inside with that. Then put on the outside of the eye tampons or wool moistened in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with a sound bandage.
We, and those of our time, apply crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and on completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, where he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movement, and let him take light foods, and let him not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark room, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a warm abscess appears, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on his face a small pillow to cover for a few days, and let him always be in that dark room.
And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his affairs;
and know that no disciple should meddle in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made pierced almonds, from which one sucks the water, but however I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almonds, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and they should be properly of bronze: And let the heads of them be of this same thinness, and the ends in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various fleshy growths arise on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are some where there is deeply embedded flesh of a livid color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not deeply embedded, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not deeply embedded, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the onion on those fleshes, and draw them out; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if any part remains that cannot be cut, then open it with all the subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overwhelms you, or the abscess bursts, then treat it as is necessary;
and if it is a malignant abscess, then hasten and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour in either vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not break through as it should, know that there is dead flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must place a somewhat thick linen thread there, and it should be knotted by hand, and have between each knot the space of a finger or less; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as much as possible, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and many times children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, sawing at the knots which are on the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back into the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a cannula, and the conduit as well;
and if you wish, make a closed cannula, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle at the top to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Often a disease called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large continually, until it is a frightening thing to behold;
and for that reason it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then apply the cautery or burning medicine to the place;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, and insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, because when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not of a livid color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, then empty it and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, it is necessary that you scrape all the parts of their heart until they bleed, then bring together the two lips with a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on top powdered dragon's blood and ground incense; and place over the powders a piece of strong plaster or another consolidating plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is that you bring together the edges: or with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
In many men there occur within the lips hard abscesses, similar to vesicles, some smaller and some larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and make an incision on each side, and grasp it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the blood is stanched;
and then remove it with vinegar, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Often there grows on the gums an added piece of flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the wound or blood flow;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after cautery;
Sometimes there are gathered at the roots of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, crusts which are foul and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be on your lap, and clean the teeth where the crusts appear, until nothing remains; and so do with the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other stains, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes what is there at the first scraping, it is good; if not, then begin again the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth need various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work demonstrates, because the scrapers with which one cleans the outside of the teeth have different shapes than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very high substance until one has no excuse for extraction.
Then when the patient is forced to extraction, it is necessary that you be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have often done this to such patients;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, it is necessary that you scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly attach the forceps; and let the patient's head be firmly between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not easily come out, take one of these instruments and insert it inside on each side lightly, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated and decayed, it is necessary that you fill it with rags where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and that greater pains than the first return to the patient because of the malice of the root.
And beware that you do not do as the ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not accomplish what we have described;
but sometimes cause a great illness because of the roots that remain, or because of the tooth that they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first loosens the teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold firmly.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains during extraction, it is necessary that you apply cotton soaked in butter to the place for one or two days, until the place is softened, then apply the forceps which are called "algefri", of which the head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these forceps, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and put there the instrument which is called "althali", that is to say, a lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out by means of this, it is good;
if not, help yourself with all the instruments, of which the forms come next:
And one helps oneself with this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and of other instruments which are used in the extraction of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients taught no instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a piece of the cart-bone or other bones, or if it rots, then he seeks among the instruments that are necessary, which I have told you, and he helps himself with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, that it not escape, but that it can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it all with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body, and the shape is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and cannot be moved or filed:
then shave it; and if it is joined with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron, sharp at the top:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it appears that one can file it, then file it with such a file as here is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then smooth it at the end with some kind of razor, and if the tooth is too sharp and it wounds the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not wound the tongue nor impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot press on what he chews without pain, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this does not help;
then it is necessary to bind them with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and double it between two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you skillfully reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the wrapping again to the point where you started, and pull your hand subtly and skillfully, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and put them between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tightened as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
it will remain and serve thus its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of the arrangement of the two healthy teeth, and of the two moved ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one replaces it in its place, again and again, as we have said;
and let no one interfere who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes a form of a tooth from ox bone, and one puts it in the place where it is lacking, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this ligament comes from under the tongue, naturally, one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have his head in your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament widely, so that the tongue is released from its constraint, and if there is hardness or knot, and this is from a sudden wound, then put in the hook and cut widely that ligament;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is underneath;
and when you have done, raise the place with rosewater and vinegar, or with cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient dress it each night, so that the place may not solder.
And if a flow of blood comes, put on the place crushed vitriol; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed,
and if you see it of a livid color or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is tending towards a whitlow, and there is moisture, then pour on onion juice, and lance it with a fine spatula, and clear it from one side and the other; and if the blood overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stanched, then return to your work until you have drawn out all the matter;
then clean the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come in the throat swellings which are called "goiter," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, then take heed:
if this abscess is hard, small, and of a livid color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a round white color, and the root is thin, have the instrument ready for cutting, but first see if the hot abscess has subsided and is calmed.
Then have the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be on your lap, and he opens his mouth and the assistant takes it between his hands, and presses the tongue down with the whole instrument, of which this is the form;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some of the web with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, that resembles tongs; and the heads are curved, and one opposite the other, and are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, cut it with pincers, of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision let the patient gargle with warm water, and vinegar and water, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then cure it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them in the same way as the two almonds equally.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had arisen in her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had forced out two veins through the two openings of the nose.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a lancet in one, then drew it out, and drew out a large portion of pus;
then I did likewise in the other opening of the nose, and I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the lancet into the abscesses, and cut a part of them, and only a little blood came out; and thus was the passage of the woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut from that abscess for a long time;
and the abscesses grew again, and filled the place that I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I bandaged it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape (or uvula)
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uve".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round and gathered and not long; and it is bloody or of a dark color or black, then you should avoid the incision of it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and its length, that you make the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the hook into the uvula, and draw it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And it is necessary that you do not cut more than the superfluity which is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of cutting, then you must use a method of cauterization so that he does not feel fear.
And the manner of cautery is very sharp. And it is that the patient puts his head in your lap, and then you press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with heated, quicklime, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and apply the tip of this instrument, of which here is the form:
And it has on the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and put the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient lies on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine inside, so that it does not descend to the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the quantity of half an hour, until you see it turn black and the burning from the medicine is subsided;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the throat above, until the cotton touches the uvula;
and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then let it dry, and it falls off after four or five days.
And if you need to restart the cauterization with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton wrapped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or than cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and avena and similar herbs, and mix them all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong earth, and in the middle of the pot there should be a perforated instrument in this manner: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of the ends be inserted into the mouth of the patient so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the throat, until the uvula is cauterized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula is dry, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the onset of the hot abscess, for several things happen there; and do not do this except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and put inside the head an eggshell, so that the mouth of the patient does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and this is a good treatment and also a cure.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue to the sun with the instrument, so that you see the thing move;
and what is not visible and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the thing will come out through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it arrives at the place, it will stick, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it may more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough comes to him, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient inserts the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is lodged; then he pushes it down, or he pulls it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech from the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the sun, then press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with thin forceps that are suitable for this.
And if that does not work, take a horsehair, and put it into the patient's throat, then put a hot iron to the end of the hair, and do this often. And let the patient drink water every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and throw it in without swallowing, and move it with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I mentioned in the fumigation of the uvula;
Do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and let the pot be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole let the head of the instrument be;
then throw in your fumigation, and the patient put the head of the tube in his mouth, and close his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and sharp things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls out the leech is, when one can see it, similar to curved pincers to enter the throat easily; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a rough surface like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses exist, according to what the following remembrance shows in this book, and they differ in perforation and size;
and this is in two ways, one of which is in its very appearance, and in what it contains of moisture.
And the second way is because of the places where they are in the body.
For an abscess of the head is different from one of the fundament, and an abscess of a fleshy place is different from one that occurs in joints, and each has its own judgment in treatment.
And there are abscesses which one should not pierce, until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that it is necessary to pierce when they are grown, and do not mature according to their completion, such as abscesses which are near joints.
For when an abscess occurs near joints, and it is left until it is rotten around, by chance the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or if the abscess is near the principal member, and you delay perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not necessary that you pierce an unripe abscess without completed digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply, and become elongated inside, and a fistula develops; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for the perforation of the ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is eased, and the fever departs, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you must make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears soft;
and let the perforation be along the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no swelling. In those that swell, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you delay the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and depths of it will harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the breadth of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many slits according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and cut; when it has become like a rag, and is mortified, it is necessary to do as is done with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the angles;
and there are some where one makes a round cut, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those which have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected a great deal of pus, and you pierce it, that you do not draw all the pus at that time, but draw a part; then stuff the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small children, or old decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you are not to blame.
Therefore complete this chapter with great caution, and when you have perceived your abscess, then wipe the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, then apply tents of linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must put a tent in each so that they meet one another;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have turned it over, then you must fill it with old cotton or linen scrapings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and place it on the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and remedies, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must apply tents and cloths moistened in warm wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, then you must apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the scalp come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are in webs, like the network of a hen's egg, and there are many similar ones.
There are some that are fatty and those in which there is moisture like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the incision is that you probe with the instrument that is called "entromissoire," of which the form comes after this, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then pierce it from above lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it without leaving anything of the skin that contains that moisture, for it returns repeatedly when one leaves anything there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will drain what remains from the night.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick matter, cut it lengthwise, according to this form; and put in your ointments, and scrape it on all sides, and use all your skill to draw out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And do the same with an abscess if it is stony, and in cutting and cleansing it as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as if from a stone.
In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the pus may come out;
and treat them as is necessary.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes occur elsewhere on the body, and are many, and are interconnected with each other.
And each scrofula is properly within its own shell, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves on every side and is not close to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the conduit, and is not deep;
then you must cut it from above, and scrape it from each part, and extend the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need them, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and draw it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far forward, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and that does not allow you to work, then put in the wound crushed vitriol, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to suppurate.
And when the blood is stanched, then return to your work, until you have completed it;
then search with your index finger if there remain any small scrofulas, cut and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is not necessary that you cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the whole scrofula, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, provided that there is no excess remaining because of the size of the scrofula. then you must take care to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.
then you must take care to cut its root and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas which contain excess, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like the one previously mentioned, depending on it, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it consumes what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the writing of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that no help be given by that, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we should cut it below three or four circles a small slit across, between the two circles or by the amount of the slit in the tonsil, not in the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the section of the epiglottis that there is no flesh, and the vessels are far away.
And if the master is fearful, then he must extend the skin of the throat with the whole index finger, then cut the skin until he comes to the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the tonsil, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm of the channel which leaps out through the place which is broken, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed of which one doubts strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely swollen, and the patient is judged to be dying, and there is a lack of breath. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed, and it is passed in three days or in four. And then they commanded to sew up the wound and cure it, until it was cured;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to cure her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood which had issued from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or a duct except the throat, and the wind issued forth through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and there happened to the young lady only that she was hoarse, and afterwards returned to her usual state;
for that reason I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called "hernia of the throat", and is a large abscess the color of a yellow yolk, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or natural has no remedy.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one is similar to a boil, and the other kind is similar to an abscess which comes from an artery; and if there is fear, and it is not necessary to work with hot iron except in that which is small, and prove it and search with the whole probe: if you find it like a small boil, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it, as one cuts boils, and pull it out with its covering, if there is any; and search well around, and treat it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
There are many kinds of boils, of which I will describe all the similar ones;
And now it is necessary that I describe the entire difference which is between a boil and a fistula.
I say that a fistula is accompanied by heat and fever, until the boil has passed, and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With a boil there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains pus, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a pimple, and becomes large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy, or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the boil, that you first examine it with the instrument which is called "introducer," according to what its form will be in the chapter which is next.
And the manner of the examination of abscesses of boils is that you take the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then that it should be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the introducer, and take care of what comes out.
If running moisture flows, what color it has, then treat it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if after the introducer no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, then incise it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it on each side and guard the skin where it lies so that you may draw it healthy with the boil;
and if you cannot draw it healthy, then draw it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the boil returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and cleanse the wound, and apply things that soothe a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the boil is large, then sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which engenders flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise bothers you, hasten and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it there two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut away what remained of the boil.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for encircling the abscesses of a fistula;
and they are like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead for encircling the curves of a fistula;
and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and they are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the boils, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these intromittors, the lancets are fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them at the opening of the abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the armpits, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a fistula probe, according to this form, with which one stops blood: and it is sometimes placed in the place that bleeds from the cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble women's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must cauterize according to this form from this line b. down to g.: then scrape the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then bring the two edges of the wound together with suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops down, and is softened by its size as happens in women, then split it in two parts above, by two similar incisions; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, then incise it as we have said in the incisions of scrofula, and if the wound produces matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is closed, many times an abscess results, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
And one knows it thus when it is due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; And when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
And when it is due to the vein, it is round and apparent outside;
And it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and in the neck and in many other places, and is very large. It is necessary then to avoid the iron treatment, and the one who is chief must avoid it also, and in the one who has an arterial swelling, it opens above the skin lengthwise;
Then make an incision with the lancet, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
Then place a needle underneath, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw out the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
Then pierce the place which is between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
Then administer the treatment that heals well, until the ligatures fall off; Then treat it with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
And if the abscess is near the vein, you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can, including the skin, then place the needle under the place you are holding with your hand, and make it pierce, and have a double thread there, so that you pull it out on the other side; Then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the ligature on one of the two sides to the two ends of the thread;
And if you doubt that the threads will come out, then insert another needle with a thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and pull the threads in four places;
Then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the core and leave that which is tied;
Then put on a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in many ways without pain;
and when it is squeezed hard, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance there would be a contraction; and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its resemblance, and its root is subtle, and its head large;
and there are small ones and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had a thin root, and were split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you observe if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungus is white and moist and of subtle root; if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready.
if so, cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery ready. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie the fungus with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the fungus, and it falls off by itself without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting it, especially for the belly, but you can well cut half of it, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then cure the wound, and take care that you do not cut the fungus which is of a reddish color and of little feeling and milky appearance.
For this is an infected abscess, and I will come to the treatment of canker later.
when the swelling comes out If the appearance of the swelling comes from cauterization of a wound or fissure of the fascia, and is on the belly and some of the swellings come out, as happens in other ruptures, or of blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is by the rupture of the fascia and by the protrusion of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and shows diverse discharge. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with one's fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and increases greatly at the entrance of the bath and due to hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain.
and if it is due to blood, then the abscess appears large and hard through these signs, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or flatulence. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie completely straight, then bleed him around the anus; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have marked with the spatula, then extend half of the abscess upwards with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the tie be secure;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the tie, and put your index finger in, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the tie, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go gently around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads on them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you made pierced;
then bind the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it festers, and the dead flesh falls away by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and festered, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and festered, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as is necessary, and close the wound.
Of the cancer We have described in the division the types of cancer, and how one should treat it with medicines, and how one should avoid the iron treatment;
and we say that cancer develops in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be excised, such as cancer that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and one should remove it entirely when it is in the beginning;
nor has anyone ever healed any before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient several times of black bile;
then make him bleed if he has manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then apply your ointments to the ulcer, and shave it on all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and press well on the area with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood prevents you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the types of dropsy, and in what manner the collection of water is made, and the signs of each type, and the treatment which is done by medicines, and that which is treated by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and ascites, for it is a mortal thing;
then when you treat this type of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment does not help, see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness besides dropsy, such as fever and diarrhea and similar things; do not touch with iron there, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient is of strong constitution, and he has no other illness but dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, you should thus work: lift the patient straight up onto your hands, and by pressing the abdomen, move the water to the lowest part of the belly, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so sharp that it can reach the intestine when it is inserted, and cannot injure it;
then see if the dropsy is located near the intestines: if so, you must make an incision above the groin, three fingers directly below the hip; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be to the left of the groin, three fingers;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities flow to that weak place;
then pierce the skin completely with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the whole spatula between the skin and the fascia, as in flaying, to the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the fascia until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the place of the water, then draw it out, and insert the instrument of which this is the form: And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and is made of bronze or light iron, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on another side, and one on another;
and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the form of the incision with which scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately settles on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the resolution of his spirit from the body, or he will faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue signify, and his pulse;
then draw out the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the hole which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then restart the instrument the next day, if you see the patient enduring it, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this for a few days, and be careful not to continue until there remains only a little water.
And if you are doubtful about the patient, and you leave too much water, then treat him with a warm burial or sand, and by much sweating or bath and sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that he have it pierced with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then put into the opening a thin lead tube, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days, and when he wants to urinate, let the tube be removed, and let him urinate, and then put it back;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine which comes forth does not leave it closed.
For him whose opening is small, he is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate unless they raise their penis upward; and cannot reproduce because the matter cannot reach the testicles, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient lies often on his back, then they straighten the head of the penis and cut it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of the bleeding which often occurs there, and if it happens, staunch it with what stanches blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these albathes appear on the penis, and it is an ugly appearance of flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
then you must take them with a fine scalpel, and cut and clean them all, then apply moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the albathe is malignant, of a foul color and festering, then you must apply a cautery there.
When you have cut it, and if the albathe is on the penis, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the albathe which is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the head of the penis is not assured that it will not be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and testicle;
therefore it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from the bark of pomegranates and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery helps in two conditions together: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, it is necessary that you insert into the canal of the penis a lead tube, and the patient urinates through it;
and when the skin is tight around the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens due to a wound or an abscess, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the bonds are loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a serious matter to remove this, it is necessary that you scrape it with a spatula a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then separate gently the two, and put there a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water, so that it does not tighten again.
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we have only that which we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around I(esus)  Christ, and forcefully, and with a single scalpel;
the heart fled, for there are two membranes, and by chance one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and for the cleansing which is from the member, the tip of the member is not assured;
and in the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work fails, and often they are born thus that they do not need cleansing, and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing which is done forcefully with a linen thread, I have found the goodness of the experience, for the threads cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single moment; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in every way that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and hold the threads between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and blow on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one thread to another;
then cleanse it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one thread to another; and hold it with two fingers by the second thread at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two threads, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on it, and on the powder a cloth glued with a yolk of a cooked egg tempered with rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The method of cleansing is this:
the two ends should be sharp and cutting, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error in cleansing is when the pus escapes at the incision;
then you must spread it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, and lightly scrape it;
then cut it as you can move, and guard the area of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then cure the place of things causing a wound with powder, which we have described in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts beyond the core and it goes to the top, it will not harm.
then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from obstruction by stone, or congealed blood, or bowel, or dead flesh, or similar things, which we have discussed in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be bent over his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constricted to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and let it be of fine silver, lightly feathered, like the quill of a bird; and let the tube be a palm and a half long, and let it be thin at the end.
And the manner of the urine's exit is that you take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread into the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the end of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and penis with warm water and olive oil;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it reach the empty thing, and this is not done according to this order except because the passage where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out forcefully, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When abrasions or blood come into the bladder, or corruption gathers there, and you want to instill waters and medicines, do it with the instrument that is called a “clepsydra,” and this is its form:
It is closed, and it has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the head through which the medicine flows should be such that it fits well into the penis without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and inject when necessary;
and when you wish to inject your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the catheter in the moisture, and draw out what is inside;
then you will draw the moisture into the catheter, and then forcefully push the liquid back inside; then the moisture will enter, and will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or of pewter, and the head is higher;
and below there is a hole where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it between the two holes firmly with a good double thread, and slightly heat that liquid over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have the bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stone, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have described the difference between the stone lodged in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one should operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is lodged in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then becomes stiff; and in many of these, the buttocks jump;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in old men, and it is moderate in young men, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the excrement that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the removal of the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him around, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes protrudes from its high place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it inside;
If you feel the stone in the space, hasten now to cut into the stone.
And if it does not fall completely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is an infant, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young person; and put it in his rectum, and seek the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press on with your finger, and push it out to where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to lift the testicles with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the shape: And cut between what is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but on the left side of the scrotum;
and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and the incision should be wide on the outside and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps press with the finger that is in the rectum, so that it comes out without effort;
and know that there are stones which have angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, for which the removal is easy.
Therefore, for one with angles and edges, make a larger incision;
and if it does not come out, then you must pull it out with forceps which are like a file at the head, to move and extract the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin instrument curved at the head;
and if you cannot manage it thus, then slightly widen the opening, and if the blood flows, then staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, then first place the largest at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, then it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine continually flows because the place cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to pull it out, or break it with tongs, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place over it a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then raise the patient's head, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the place very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions come in the wound, and congelation of blood in the bladder, and the urine is retained by this, which is known in such a way that it comes out with the urine: put your finger then into the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will run to the bladder, and rot it;
then clean the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help it in every way you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the place.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the penis, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; then cure it in the way I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the cutting by this cure. I have already proven this thus.
Take an iron drill according to this form and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return into the bladder;
then put the drill into the penis lightly, until it comes to the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this because of anything that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three reasons:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will uncover herself to the doctors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-versed in this art;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is deeper than the stone in a man, wherefore it requires a deeper incision, and there is great danger. And if necessity demands it, then you must take a knowledgeable midwife, and they are scarcely to be found, and if you do not find one, seek in no way a chaste and subtle physician;
and present to her a wise woman skilled in the lives of women, or a woman who knows something of the art, and instruct her to do what you command her regarding the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should restrain it beneath her finger, and instruct her to place her finger in the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand firmly against the bladder.
If she finds it, then she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it comes to the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vagina, where the muscle is prepared, and the stone is felt in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then put the instrument into the incision, if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound so that the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and which have roots.
so know the similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put crushed vitriol in the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of the stone in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the place and restrain it with tents and bandages, and do not begin again, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient die by chance; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is calmed, and the place is dried, then return to your work, until the stone is removed.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a gathering of moisture or white humor, which is below the skin of the testicles, that contains the egg;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one thinks that it is another egg; and that is the skin of the testicle between the white humor that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this humor has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to know this collection, for if it is in the white membrane that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because it has humor all around.
And if there is humor in the proper tunic, the abscess is round with a part of the egg, and therefore it is thought to be another egg;
and if the humor is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, one feels it well;
therefore when you wish to know the color of the humor, probe it with the entirely smooth instrument, of which the form is given above. According to that then which comes after the probe, judge that which is inside.
And when we cure it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the repletion of his body;
then place him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths underneath him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart from the testicles;
then take the sharp knife, and cut the skin of the scrotum lengthwise to near the handle, and let your incision be straight, separating the skin of the scrotum to the white fascia, and scrape it subtly according to your ability;
then pierce the fascia full of water with one large hole, and draw out all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the fascia; cut all or in pieces evenly the side of it subtly, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out of place during your work, put it back in place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if pus is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put on top other wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it over the two testicles, and put on top doubled cloths, and bind it all with a bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness and let them be joined by sewing at the waist of the breeches, and one of the ends should go over the buttocks to the back, and the other to the groin area;
and the other two ends over the two groins, and let all the binding be assembled in the loop of the breeches;
and sometimes this testicle is treated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and that is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white surface which contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the tongs, and scrape it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you have scraped everything;
and take care that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this operation is safer; and less likely to cause bleeding, and less dangerous than cutting operations;
and if anything goes wrong, an abscess forms, or there is bleeding or something else, then treat what is wrong, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and does not want to undergo this operation because of its horror, then administer a perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are certain by the signs we have mentioned that watery humor is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water can flow out;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound is healed;
And if the white linen does not allow the water to escape from the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from the dropsical, whose form is shown above;
and widen the wound a little, and know that the water returns, and is collected after six months or thereabouts, and when it is collected as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in many situations, wherefore it seems to me better that it be left;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come in the body, and especially to the testicles; and that is in many cases.
That is to say, by a surplus of sour and sharp humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it finds no pain, and is a serious abscess;
and perhaps there are serious, dangerous, and suppurating abscesses, and of a livid color, and sometimes it comes from an artery rupture, or from vein inflammation.
When it is from an artery rupture, it is known by the disposition of the warm abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and it is not necessary that you touch it.
That which is made from vein inflammation is known by its disposition upon pressing with the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this and on other similar flesh; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the egg upwards, and draw the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already soldered with its neighboring flesh, then it is necessary that you draw out the testicle, and cut it;
and if it is adhering to the sheath, or to that which is within the vessels, it is necessary that you free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
And the treatment of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you its treatment, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the penis, and let the master hold them, and extend them strongly;
then cut with a wide, sharp spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the pus has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted humors;
then cure the wound like the others where you apply a poultice, so that no vessel is cut that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then it is necessary to draw out the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the incision that happens in the syfac, or the stretching on the abdomen in the groin area, because of which the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the syfac, or of the stretching of it, and these two manners come from many causes:
from percussion, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the stretching of the syfac, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are even up to the depths, because the syfac presses on the intestines.
And the sign is that when it is from the section of the syfac, it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscesses appear differently, under the skin, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine and the body outside the syfac.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are retained there, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore one must avoid them.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into the wound with his hand, if he can return it there; then let it be supported on its neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert into the lips of the wound hooks according to what you need to open the wound, and let them be such that the egg can come out;
then peel the tunic that is under the skin of the scrotum, until the white hard tunic is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white tunic which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second tunic, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second tunic;
and then move with your right hand inside the scrotum, and extend the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the tunic towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and untie that which is behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped in the hard white tunic, and if you find anything, put it back into the belly below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and put it into the back part of the tunic, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the groin, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the tunic, which we have said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter into them, that no abscess may form there; and put the ligature again according to the first ligature along two fingers of that one, and after these two ligatures leave of the tunic which is under the skin of the scrotum the breadth of a finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle bears;
then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood flows, and the bowel, as we have said above;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and put it in the wound, and apply the ligature that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white tunic that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be sprinkled with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is made like the branch that is next to the vein, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess with what works, until the vessels close;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the scrotum, and if any descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and however, if it remains too long at this point, the wound or sheath grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens by the extension of the sheath which is at the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture wide according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then draw out the sheath which is under the skin that follows it, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the sheath;
and press it into the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the sheath over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then draw out the head of the root, and do not cut the sheath nor extend the egg nor anything else, as I have made known to you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the treatment of wounds.
then cure it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sheath is constricted, and there is no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and nearer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is ugly to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin on the natural skin;
then bring together the two lips with a suture, and if you wish, first sew the superfluity of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to discuss it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon knows how to respond when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by traction or by incision.
In that which we do by traction, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by incision: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut each testicle with one cut, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave some of the tunica albuginea and the thin membrane that is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because with traction, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, wherefore the animal desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes the urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and she has above the pubis something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and treat them like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men from whom the urine spurts through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tetanus is a growth of flesh on the natural part, so that it is very ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the tetanus with your hand or with forceps, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood come, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and to another growth that arises at the mouth of the womb, and fills it, and perhaps bursts forth, and is in the likeness of a cauliflower, and for this reason the ancients called it "cauliflower disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tetanus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come there; or it is by added flesh, or by thin or thick scar tissue, and it is made deeply in the womb, or on the sides, or below, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps even having menstrual flow;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the vagina.
If the swelling is close to the surface, seek it with your fingers or a probe.
If it is of thin scar tissue, and it is close to the two lips, hasten, and break it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, her legs spread;
then spread the two lips widely, until the thin scar tissue is broken, and the swelling is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie on her stomach each day, so that it cannot close.
And if the scar tissue is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the swelling is of raw flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, mixed with egg white;
then apply a wide lead splint, so that the wound cannot close;
and so it should remain for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other treatments until it is healed.
And when in the wound, newly formed flesh appears, then it should be cut according to this method, unless it is an inflamed abscess. For an inflamed abscess which is in the wound, one should not touch with iron.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood usually flows, and when hemorrhoids are old they become swollen;
and we have already said in the division the similarities of them, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swelling, when they are deep in the wound and do not appear to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the wound, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then grasp the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then dust on medicines that restrain blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then place her in cold water;
and if bleeding occurs, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster of it for her back.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without wounding;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said of the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscesses and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscesses, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the sea, which is not of the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is eased;
and then make the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet together towards the back of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread, and place his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then suck him towards the right side, and apply the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the form comes later;
and it is necessary that when you apply this instrument, that you first insert a probe to know the depth of the abscess, so that what enters the instrument does not go in deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he place the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one feels it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, at the spatula;
and when the boil is emptied, it is necessary that you put in the wound tents soaked in rose oil, or in dry green oil;
and place the tent deep into the abscess, and place on top of the abscess and on the wound clean wool moistened in water in which mallows have been boiled;
then cure it after two days with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the abscess and the wound with an enema of water and honey, and then with water in which lily roots and birthwort have been boiled; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the abscess, then you must avoid cautery with iron, but treat it as we have said in the section.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the form of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to defecate:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that that childbirth is according to the natural form, and the exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet first, and the body or head and hands come out, or it comes on its belly, or back, and is perhaps turned over on its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and subtle in these things, and guard against error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one must help her.
If the child comes head first by natural issue, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, then make her sit on a saddle, or the women hold her;
and raise its nature with oil or fenugreek which is cooked, and then let the midwife put between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: and split the secundine, and cut with her nail until the moisture which is inside runs out;
and grasp the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with linseed oil;
then make her sneeze and cough with sneezing powder, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, it is necessary that you gently put them back little by little; and if they cannot be put back in, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet; then bring the seat down to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is lowered;
and if the hands cannot be put back in, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is mentioned above, and extract the child, and reposition equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it comes down to the thighs, then order it to be grasped, and make it sneeze with a potion; if it jumps out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to its natural form. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take mallow mucilage, and linseed oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put it on the woman's genitals and outside this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to her ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and clear her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will jump out immediately.
of the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this way, let the midwife put her hands in little by little; then let it be supported on its neck, and its feet hang down, and let it lie on a bed; and bend its hands little by little, and then take its hands above its belly, and remove the pillows from underneath, until it is positioned downwards; and if the child does not jump, take its feet and move them forcefully, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands in; and draw out the child little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child emerges.
of the emergence of the child which comes from the womb with one hand hanging down It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman stand up and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on a seat, then study how to bring back the hand; and draw out the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit over its neck, and its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when it is even, then apply to the area a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner with all the afterbirth
in this same manner with all the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with all the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the navel, so that it may not be retained, and the child die;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take hold of herself sometimes:
Of the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except rarely;
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except rarely; I know that, if they are multiplied, and are separated by the syfac which divides them, which is attached to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out badly, treat them as we have said, and let the midwife be skillful, and do quickly and easily what she does; and do as is best for their salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more, up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the wise and glorious, and the midwife must know all this, for by chance similar things happen; then she should act accordingly.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to use your hands; then you must know if the woman is of sound constitution and has no accident or fear of death;
then the woman must be placed on her back, her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised;
and the attendant hold her in two places, or she be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek and linseed mucilage, then anoint the hands of the midwife with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them into the womb lightly, then find a place where she inserts the fingers that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
then insert the fingers into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the clavicle or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, insert them into the heel and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the finger with his right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and insert it with his whole hand lightly, and insert the finger into one of these places that we have said, until he reaches the empty thing;
then insert another finger, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is even;
and then extend it equally, moving from one side to the other, for the extraction, and let the fingers be toothed to hold the extraction, as the form is here:
And if a part remains, let him lubricate some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull out the other part;
and if some remains, put this finger or another higher up, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and he cannot pull it back because of the tightness, then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it all comes out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and it is narrow at the exit, or if it has collected sharp water on the head, then you must put the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and drain the water; or you round it with the instrument which is called "almidach", the shape of which is shown with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is pulled out by the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture which is in the vagina comes out;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the turning towards the mother's mouth is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or chest, until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand into the depths of the mother, and pulls it down to the mother's mouth; then she puts in one or two fingers, and pulls it strongly;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot abscess which has formed there, then you must not work there, but you must apply moist and greasy things; and apply plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then apply what we have said for a living child;
and if one does not have the power [to do so], then pull it out forcefully piece by piece, and do not leave anything of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then apply what we have said concerning hot abscesses which occur in the womb;
and if a flow of blood comes, let it be put in astringent water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose belly a child had been dead, then another was conceived on top of that one, and the other one was also dead. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to the treatment, and I thought about it for a long time, and I could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after some days another. I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the belly.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and extracted many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little pus always came out of the place;
and I have only included this chapter because when the master finds something strange, he should know how to help.
After this comes the form of the pressor, with which one presses the books;
and with two turns at the two heads of the two ligaments. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the shaft should be one finger wide, and the edge of the horns one finger, and a palm and a half long; and between the two ligaments should be two additions of this same shaft, which are fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the instrument to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and have at the two ends two additions, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the instrument completely, have the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then insert the two additions joined together into the instrument, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the instrument, until the opening does what it should.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their forms are multiplied; and when the surgeons have prepared them, the work is so much faster, and more highly regarded by men because of their quantity.
Do not disdain the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a concoction, and hold your hands to her mouth and nose; and if she expels it by this means, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in the pot in water over the fire;
then place a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the afterbirth comes out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow poultice, and then put it into the birth canal, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently stretch it out straight, so that the womb does not fall during the extraction;
but it should be moved gently to the right and left, and then pulled; then it will come and detach itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is too constricted, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing, and of herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, be careful not to be forceful in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then you administer a clyster of tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and come out.
However, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass, similar to a funnel, and one puts the narrow end into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be on the coals, and let it burn until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the rectum pierced, but have it stopped up by a thin membrane: then it is necessary for the midwife that she pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and guard the wound that she does not touch it;
then put on wool moistened in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead cannula in the opening, and leave it there for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this obstruction comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that obstruction; then it should be cured, as we have said of the lead cannula.
Fistulas which come from under the fundament are knots and swellings that come near the inflamed fundament, or in the space between the two parts, then there is one fistula or several;
and when that knot is old, it works, and still moist, white or subtle pus oozes, and sometimes these fistulas are perforating;
and are known by the fact that there comes out with the excretion or flatulence when the patient excretes, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach to the joint of the thigh, and to the bottom of the buttock.
And thus one recognizes the perforating fistula in the anus, and the non-perforating: and that is that you put your index finger in the anus, and put a thin needle of bronze or iron in the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then put a thin lead tent or a horsehair there, until you feel the tent or the hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there is no discharge of excretion or flatulence or worm from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not perforate; hurry to cure it.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, then the urine escapes, and it cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced as far as the hip joint, the tent is placed as far as the place; if there is no tortuosity and the source of pain is nearby, then pus always flows out, and neither medicine nor healing by ointment helps;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish doctors who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and he raises his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs bent towards his belly; then put in a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent goes.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is uncovered where you feel between your finger the pus or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; then do not work at it if it cannot be healed.
It is said however that some can be well healed, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done there, is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it all hot in the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the rotten flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that rotten flesh comes out, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is in the bottom, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or of a membrane, and you see the fistula to which the covering of the heart follows; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward continuously, and then cauterize afterward, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten fleshes that resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added fleshes, and the staunching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place throws off pus, and the burned flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that cause healthy flesh to grow, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula reaches deep into the bottom, and is distant from the body, put your finger into the bottom, and search it.
If you feel the tent, and between two is the membrane or the fascia or flesh, where it is about to pierce, there should be nothing but hope and expectation, through the administration of one of the three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you put tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the bottom, and an evacuation comes through the wrong way. Then treat it, as we have said;
Then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the bottom, either with a tent or other pointed instrument; then cleanse that corrupted flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the base:
then strive to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part outside the base: that will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are like this: and it is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is at the side of the base near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this form: And put a twisted thread in two, and put the tent with the thread in the fistula until it reaches the end.
If it is penetrating into the edge of the base inside, then pull the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger in the base;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one against the other, and leave it one or two days;
and tighten it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between them, and they fall out;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut so deeply for the lacing, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the pointed spatula with which one cuts the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: or they are inside the rectum, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the rectum and at the end of the rectum;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and constantly discharge a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the flesh;
and the cure for those who have them inside the rectum is that you instruct the patient to strain to defecate, until the rectum protrudes, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp it with forceps, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then grasp them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of camel hair; and extract them with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on some hot powders that are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then give the patient a clyster of a biting and harsh clyster to wash that which is in the rectum, so that it may come out clearly; when the patient is seized, and the threads are strong from the rectum, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and the threads are strong from the rectum, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with forceps, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that he dreads the incision by iron. Then you must administer the suture in this manner:
Then you must administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread tightly, then knot the thread, and remove the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to run off the excess blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or cerate, and put it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the dryness of the wound or bottom Many times there is dryness of the wound in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or with your nail the crust above, which does not let it moisten; then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping more strongly than before, until it bleeds much, and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of the trembling Formication is a slight tingling sensation around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds the cold, and it is felt as if dead from trembling, and comes in the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the trembling, until the circle encompasses the trembling all around; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the trembling, and put it deep, and eradicate the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of bronze or iron in this manner, and let it be fine below and thick above: not pierced, to hold better in the finger, and to press better.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or pewter, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those then which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wider above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there is a release where the belly is tied, as you see, and the bottom is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly where one puts the medicines be of an animal bladder or parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth between each hole, then put into these holes a strong thread of raw thread twisted in an X or however, and gather the belly like a goat's bladder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the minister compresses it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is a greater help.
And if you clysterize him in a disease of bowel looseness, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as thin as for a child;
and this is the form of the thin clyster on which the skin is strained:
We have, I said in the division, the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures by hand and by medicine, according to the fulfillment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and what they are made of.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the cut of a sword and knife, or of a lance or stick or arrow, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure of each wound, and I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is still broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid fullness of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not exposed to the air, the powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the burning has exposed it, put on some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be joined by tents, join them by suture, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, of the suture.
If the wound exposes the bone, and hangs, and only holds by a little, cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, also such as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the putrid flesh, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, seek the artery, and if you find it loosened, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and that you put in this powder which heals before the flesh has moved.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply it to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it dries well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it untied, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but the burning must not have moved the wound.
And if the burning has moved the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder there;
but puts on some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it throws off pus; then cure it with other cures until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you later about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerves of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not to apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, such as warm washings in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked herbs also washed in fresh water, and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it in the lowest place;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding occurs, tie it off, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the conduit is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the throat's neck, and do not touch the throat but reset it according to its natural form; and then bind it carefully, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search it; and if there are pieces of bone, pull them all out if you can, and those which you cannot remove, leave until the wound festers, and the discharge is loosened and cleaned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, observe whether air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not apply powder at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood remain inside, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; then there will be no spasm, nor tremor, nor bad heart constriction, nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healed. Treat it then with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, always know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the breast or back, treat it as one would treat a wound on the front; if it is large, by suture;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is close to the bone, and has cut pieces, cleanse the wound, and pull out splinters if they are detached; and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, this will facilitate extraction;
and for other wounds in other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, causing their introduction;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, if one does not put them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they return more difficultly, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one more easily restores the intestine to its place than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or you cook in water squinant and cyprus and spike, and bathe the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and althea have been cooked, for by this the entry is easily made;
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, for no one should cut unless there is great necessity;
and these are the instruments for splitting it:
cut inwards into the curve and not outwards, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestines jump out, put them back in their proper place according to their natural form, if you are able, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, put your attention to that the injured part be higher than the other;
and thus you must manage what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, put what you have prepared, then have in your hands a compassionate assistant who holds the whole rupture with his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common method of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or more, according to the size of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one finger's breadth of space, and there stick a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the fascia, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce from that part, and bring together the two edges of the fascia, the four together;
then tie a double thread around the needle on two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound evenly, and then leave one finger's breadth of space, and there stick another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this as you need needles, until the whole wound is closed;
and let the needles be medium-sized, between fine and thick, for the fine needles cut all the flesh, and the too thick ones cannot enter well: therefore it is necessary that they be medium-sized;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far from the flesh and the skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the closure;
and then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and put tents or cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles suffice.
The second suture is common, and is that you join the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the fascia together with a needle with a strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and place between each stitch the thickness of a small finger;
This suture is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and the intestines protruded well two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been twenty-four hours outside, and the wound was healed until fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, because I was in a place where none was found, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of stitching:
Take the needle, and put it from the outside part to the inside;
when it has pierced straight through, leave the head of the thread where you inserted the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inside to the outside;
and the meaning of this stitch is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread on one side once, and take it up on the other, until the stitching is completely done.
The second method of stitching, which Galen properly described, is as some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the nearest edge of the wound, and make it pierce that place only, and leave the two ends of the thread; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
then pierce one and the other from the outside to the inside, at two other edges of the wound that are on the other side;
and this is the best method of stitching and the most common.
Galen says this, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each;
and one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, then replace the intestine and sew it;
then put on the flesh-generating powder, and if the heat has changed it, then put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and cut the threads, and let the surfaces and the muscles be joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound will affect the principal members, then you must moisten light wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the armpits and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then give him enemas of warm red wine, and especially if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is injured, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the intestine protrudes from the wound, put it back in place like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must tie off the area that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut that which is between the ligature, and hang the two ends from the part below the wound outside to facilitate the extraction when the intestine falls, and the wound heals.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it was ulcerated and became a fistula, and the excrement and gases came out of it;
I applied a treatment according to my ability, and I did not cease to refine it until he was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it closed, I feared that the patient had an internal injury in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: Take strong tweezers, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the tweezers have opened the mouth, place it over the two edges, so that it pulls the edges together;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another tweezer afterwards in the same manner as before, until the whole wound is grasped; and sew the wound.
The ends are burnt in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
take the end of this intestine thread that is very cleaned, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine, and bring it back to the opening;
and this method of sewing with tweezers is not wrong except according to the way of faith and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no skill or knowledge, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it matures, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is haired and returns pus.
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a hardened, white, faulty knot, where one feels no pain, and it is as hairy as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and sometimes thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh, is only because of one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of blood or body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh within, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property of the region is slow in digestion, and health is slow, and swollen by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the syfac, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to some joint of the hands or feet; and so there is such a one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin tent of lead, for the lead bends itself around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then clysterize it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleanse it;
then search it wisely to your power, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deeply rooted, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove from there the foul matter and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then cure it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight place, then it is necessary that you cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in moistened tents in medicated water, and push them down to the head of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the superfluity that has remained at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is uncovered, and there is corruption and blackness, then clean it until all the corruption is removed, then cure it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns bad as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom:
then uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and do not leave even one;
and if the moisture opposes you, and there is no risk or fear, then cut away the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then apply something to the wound that causes putrefaction, and leave it until the place is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come away more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then dress the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it is necessary to cauterize and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example from it and aid in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the matter came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open it;
but the physicians through their folly worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated, and what ran through the holes in a large stream; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellow color.
I placed a tent in one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one came towards another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption went as far as the bone within;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with boiling medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strove to heal the place; but I could not, so that I cut around a handbreadth of the bone, and removed it completely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to recommence the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation he bled often, but he was healed entirely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary at all, neither in going nor coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is exposed, and instruct someone to stretch it upwards; and put another linen bandage thicker than the first bandage, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and stretch the head, so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you wish to sew, that the suture may not injure the flesh;
and put a hot iron or a small board under the bone to cut the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to sew as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and sew again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not appear, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then put a hot iron underneath, and then sew from one part to the other the corruption, and let the suture be the length of the corruption a little, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and sew the bone where it is held on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, then there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, that is a very serious matter, but nevertheless it is necessary that you examine that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the incisions and the threads for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their thinness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of diseases; so prepare the instrument you need according to what is required.
The heads [joints] become rotten either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or by the greater evil, of the loss of the member;
and the sign is that the member becomes black, so that it seems as if it were burned by fire, and it rots after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from member to member, and takes over the whole body;
so hasten to cut, and if it is by the striking of some venomous beasts, such as a sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come down to the hand.
And if it comes down to the hand, cut it off at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it off at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its power;
and do likewise when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it off after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends in the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you bind it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the bindings downwards, and another assistant the other binding upwards, and you separate the flesh that is between the two bindings to a width of one span, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and another lesion and abscess is caused in the patient.
And if profuse bleeding occurs while you work, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared on his toe, until it consumed the entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterward the corrosion returned to his finger, and he came to me, and I applied repelling remedies after cleansing the body, and the corrosion would not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I would not, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, that he would die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess comes in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then it bursts and breaks open, and the pus flows out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin which is above is as thin as a fine cloth, and does not reach to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you have confidence that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
observe if the abscess is large, and the pus that comes out is foul-smelling, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and clysterize the abscess, and extract the matter; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then extract it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the abscess is cleansed, and the pus is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with lye, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over it, then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the abscess is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the lye, then clysterize with water and honey in which there is a little powdered litharge; or you clysterize with honey and mead, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine helps to dry the pus;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the abscess is well cleansed, then clysterize with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and it is that you take diachylon plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you clysterize with some medicines and ointments, of which I have spoken of the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the abscess is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron instrument, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then sew it and leave only a place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it at a lower place.
and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest place, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare it in this manner: that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidative medicines to put on the sore, and spread them on a linen cloth that covers the whole sore; then cut forcefully at the opening of the sore a little wider than before, then spread soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the sore to ease the pus, and do not remove the large outer cloth except after many days, once;
and the one that is over the opening of the sore, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take heed if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this manner and you see the nature that rises above the opening of the sore, then know that the sore will heal, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh regenerates slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus erupts from the sore after many days, know that the sore will not heal;
and if the sore is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as diafinitive ointment, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diafinitive ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose wine equal in substance;
then mix it and use it;
and this same is better cooked and thickened, when diafinitive ointments are not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and crush it, and powder it over the honey while it is over the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the sore, and sometimes one administers aristolochia longa, and roots of lily of the valley, which is like chickpea flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: crush them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; then cure it with the cure for fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or by chance arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and one does not take care of it, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and throws pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrupts the whole thing;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, until there is a foul smell and pain, and the end of the finger is swollen, and the color is dark red.
When you treat it as we have said in the section, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with an iron instrument all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and injure it, then you must place a thread under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply to the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you want to amputate the finger, cut it at the joint as previously stated, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is wounded and swollen, and it causes great pain, then you must first heal it;
then cut the nail of the whitlow sharply by cutting across from above, and beware that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, put something on it which soothes.
The supernumerary fingers which grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and by chance there are some where there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the fingers.
That which grows on any part of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, by chance moves;
the removal of that which is fleshy is easy, in this manner: cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: therefore be careful of cutting.
In that which grows on the finger at the last knuckle, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh around to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The joining together that occurs between the fingers comes from birth, or from the closing of a wound, or from a burn, or from similar things.
It is necessary that you cut that joining, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, that they may not join; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If a joining occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that joining as is necessary.
Varicose veins are large swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many members of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you must sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, two, or three places, with a wide cut, then raise and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then place him in the bath, and pour warm water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, heat it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the knee to the ankle;
then open the skin with the lancet, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then place a thread underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then pierce it lightly with the lancet, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the thread, as you have done, and pierce it with another lancet, as you did before;
then cut another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong doubled thread in it, and tie it and pull it, and put a thread underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull it or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put on the wound wool moistened in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must forcefully split it, but not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the intestine is curved, and does not cut sharply, lest it cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms are generated within the body, between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two fingers' breadth, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time that something comes out from it, wrap it around the lead and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is completely emerged; for if you cut it, it returns into the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad illness;
because of which it is necessary that it be treated little by little to the end, and that nothing of it remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the opening, and pierce it to the bottom, so that all comes out;
and let the matter that is inside be emptied, and administer to the place medicines preventing putrefaction for some days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many openings come from it, and from which many roots emerge;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms that are born between skin and flesh This disease is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and is a small worm that is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body ascending and descending, and one feels it well in going from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and jumps forth;
and is engendered from the corruption of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and ascarids come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it moving and drawing, one cannot take it out except when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong ligature very tightly, then cut above and pull it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does is that it runs to the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming near the eye, press firmly below it on the eyebrow, then cut above, and pull it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with bodily purification using purgative medicines for the putrid humors, and to warn him against foods that induce putrefaction.
Of the pain that comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and shortly afterwards, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it was constantly turning around her body, as I saw it.
I was very surprised how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never before seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had felt pain move from one place to another, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins uncovered, and because of this, that constrained windiness appeared;
and it does not appear for the same reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then bind it above and below quickly, and then cut above until that constrained windiness escapes from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels windiness, such as foul-smelling pills, and pills of seraphin, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearance and according to the places of the body where they lodge.
The diversity of them is that there are some which have large points, and small, and barbed, and smooth; and of those which have two angles, and of those which have barbs, and of those which are broken;
and that which lodges in a limb lodges in two ways: or in a principal member, such as brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then lodges in any part of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall tell you hereafter, appear: then you must avoid the extraction of this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then I draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs of injury to the brain when the arrow strikes and pierces the bone, and the dura mater which is over the brain is punctured, are:  scotoma, deafness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood flows from the nostrils, or the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and a white moisture resembling pus issues from the wound, and also something like shredded flesh;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not already out.
The signs that an arrow has struck the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were embedded in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and there is coldness and cold sweat, and fainting; know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the signs that the arrow has injured the lung are that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is near the small ribs; and he breathes heavily and feels great pain and sighs; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some dung spurts out through the ruptured intestine, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows continuously, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the face and neck and throat and shoulder and shoulder joint and spine and collarbone and thigh and legs, and similar limbs, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I grasped it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I pulled out from a man an arrow that struck him in the fat of the eye, under the eyelid. The arrow was deeply embedded, and I could only reach the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the man was healed, and no bad consequences followed.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabian arrow with barbs:
I cut the barbs, and worked so carefully that I pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, that had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut on the arrow, and I grasped it, and pulled it out forcefully, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow fell into his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow fell, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without suffering great pain;
and many others similar.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning towards the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen in three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I sought it with a very fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I applied to the place an attractive and digestive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the place of the arrow appeared to me.
and the place of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained so a long time, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put a sharp corrosive medicine on the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared to me visibly;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I put in the forceps, and moved them from one side and the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise methods of instruments, until I took it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will be at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and restored the wound.
And the surgeons judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely healed.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you apply your care to that which I do not say, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master considers even a small thing, and from that which is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, for the overcoming of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs where they are fixed except according to two manners: either through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaping out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, then leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, then leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, then pierce around it with a thin drill, until the place around it is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is hidden in the body so that one cannot see it, then search for it with a tent. and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot [remove it] because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein [in the way], then enlarge the wound;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, then remove the flesh that is attached on two sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, for you would pull it out with more difficulty.
And if you cannot [remove it] in one go, then leave it until the surrounding area is rotted, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, then use what we have said about the treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise a way how you can best pull out the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow entered, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it is visible, or the skin is swollen where it can be seen or felt clearly:
then cut above it, until the forceps can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out immediately.
And if it is lodged in the bone, turn your hand round and round until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it there for a while, and then begin the extraction again until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, remove it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer a pull, use a suitable instrument so that the point of the arrow enters the head of the instrument;
and then pull it out, and if the arrow is broken, use an instrument with a point that enters inwards to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as is necessary.
And if the arrow breaks in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is near the surface and you can cut to it, then cut.
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which one extracts arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like the feather of a bird, to push at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
There are thirty-one veins from which one is bled, of which there are sixteen in the head, namely: Two temples which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein which is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the upper lips of the mouth, and these are the veins which are called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "median", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "vein of the belly", and it is on the forearm, and it is that from which one bleeds, which clearly appears on the wrist.
And the salvatic vein is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nessa", which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with chronic catarrh and migraine;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging down from the head: then press them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and insert it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand with the whole vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers breadth across, and let blood flow as much as you wish;
then constrict and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and headache, and habitual ophthalmia, and for the flow of watery tears from the eyes;
and the qualities of bloodletting are as I said: and it is that the patient should constrain his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse beneath your finger, and then bleed from there;
then lift the skin over the vein upward with your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward, and cut it, as you have done with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your needs;
then unbind the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have spoken of their cutting and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein in the forehead is as good as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the method is that the patient twists his neck until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called a "digger", of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the amount you wish; then untie the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work is done with a wide blade.
However, the blade should not be too sharp; and cut across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the blade will break when it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins that are in the two temples helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and hordeolum in the eye, and the diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bleeding is that the patient strains his neck by twisting it with some linen, as before;
then bleed, and let the bleeding be across, a little of the length of the blade a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the blade is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for water, and for raging fever, and for facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, especially when it is old;
and the method of bleeding is that the patient should constrict his neck, then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin blade, and insert it between the lips in the space between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for one night, for it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two temples helps with shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and many diseases, and impetigo, and toothache, and herpes, and fistulas;
and the method of bleeding is that the patient should constrict his neck under one and the other ear, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do likewise in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of the bleeding of the lips Bleeding from the veins of the upper lip helps with a boil in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the quality of the bleeding is to make the patient sit before you, and bind his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left, and one knows them by this that they are black, and by this that around them are small black veins:
cut then one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do likewise with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same manner.
Of the bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts the tongue, and looks on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the throat from which one commonly bleeds are bled according to two methods:
either by pricking with a flat, myrtle-shaped blade, or an olive-shaped, fine one like cutting knives, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide and narrow according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle-shaped blade is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is necessary for opening hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and cloudy blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped blade:
and it is more subtly pointed, and is for bleeding the thin veins, where there is thin, yellow blood.
Bleeding from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the breast, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the phlebotomist that he bleeds wisely, and that he beware of the artery which is below. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it is necessary to stop it, as I have said; and the blade should not be pointed, but cutting like a chisel.
And if the basilica vein does not clearly appear, then it is necessary that you draw it out, and choose another; or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it clearly appears; and cut it with a chisel-shaped blade, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, it is necessary thus that you extend the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with the chisel-shaped blade; and beware that you do not injure the artery when you see the place swollen, for that is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is arterial blood: hasten yourself then, and place your finger on it firmly, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if it is the arm, bind it up, and leave it thus, and let not the patient move it;
and let it be with caution, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for the head of it retracts; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of bark from a fig tree, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on well until the next day;
If the blood stops, it is well; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the staunching is not difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound, and the binding power of the arm.
The bloodletting of the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be careful of the nerve that is below, and if he goes too deep and finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps cannot be healed;
and this nerve is often visible, and if it is not visible in some men because of its thinness, then you must bleed it with a blunt instrument; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, because it draws blood from the head and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by puncturing the olive-shaped vein or the myrtle-shaped vein, for this is the safest of all veins, because it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one must seek the easiest place, and it does not matter if one misses the first time, and one begins again; and perhaps the place swells in some men when one misses the first time, but it does not matter.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your intention.
The first thing you must know about bleeding is that bleeding is not administered except to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are in the neck: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding which is administered for illnesses has no set time, but when need is, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years, nor a woman carrying a child except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the old who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor dropsies;
and one should refrain from bleeding after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse for women, and work, wakefulness and fasting, and anything that weakens the strength, either of mind or body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and by medicines, if you have the power;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to refine the blood, and bleed from the vein of the breast around the third, as we have said;
and on that day guard yourself from work, and pain, and lust, and similar things;
and be cheerful and joyful, and the bleeder should be higher than the one being bled, and he should rub the arm two or three times, then tie the ligature moderately above, for when it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with the hands, until the veins swell, and one feels them;
then the bleeder moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail when it is struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when being bled, and there are some that are full of windiness, so that when one puts the lancet on, it withdraws from the lancet, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be skilled in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, it is good; if not, he begins again a little below that place or above quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave him one or two days, and do not bind the arm: by chance an abscess will form there;
nor enter the bath, then resume the bleeding if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you fear that not as much blood will come out as you wish, thrust into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work a little quickly, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not resume the bleeding, and put on a little oil of lead, for it lightens the body of blood, and lead is milder in this place than oil;
and thus administer the oil of lead in each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stanch the flow of blood;
and the same does theriac and ox-gall, when one puts it on the place; so it thins the blood and it disperses when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled except at that time when the opening of the vein is small, then hasten, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and a little warm vinegar, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the issuing of blood from the vein, and if there remains at the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mint, or the like.
And many times an abscess and appearance occur at the bleeding of the basilica:
then put your hand on, and if you find the place soft with the compression of the hand, then that appearance is bad. Avoid then that you put on anything of what we have said, for perchance it cuts off from the artery;
but make him a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw from each one blood according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full-bodied and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made, and the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should be bled little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by piercing;
and this manner of bleeding is safe from blood flow and nerve cutting, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or across.
And to one whose body fails during bleeding, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is feverish, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of cold complexion, let him eat before bleeding bread soaked in spiced syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bleeding, after the release of much blood, then he should drink broth of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the section or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of a vein.
And if he wants to bleed his arm, and bleed another time, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wants to bleed his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; therefore a large quantity must be drawn, and the opening widened until it falls into a faint; then you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, that death may not come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you wish to untie the arm, and cause blood to flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is crooked, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of a flame, until the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein flows out freely, and place upon it a little salt dissolved in water, and press lightly upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is subsided.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the vein of the head because it is composed [in a similar way/is similar].
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the lancet is red;
then it is bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed immediately across, not across the width or length;
and let the opening be wide, and bleed very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for one puts it in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the manner:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, entirely bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water if the blood is congealed in the wound and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is needed, put oil and salt on the vein to quickly close it, and do so for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphenous vein is good for all the illnesses that are below the body, such as diseases of the womb, and the retention of menses, and disease of the kidneys, and of the old thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its bloodletting is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it swells, and binds above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many veins go above the foot;
bleed then from the largest vein, or at the ankle, which is more valuable.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed across as if cutting;
and let the blade be sharp.
And if the blood cannot come out, put the foot in water, and let the vein drain well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again a little higher up, for the place is salty;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bleeding is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and presses above the ankle with four fingers twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is very responsive in many men.
and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is very responsive in many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and venesection is done according to two methods: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this venesection which is without cutting is according to two methods: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and venesection which is done by cutting and by extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is at the very top of the head; and the other is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and the cupping between the two arms; and the cupping on the two legs; and the cupping on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bleeding from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or by custom, then we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the temple helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary that one who is of cold complexion use it, or who has a catarrh, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who is bled often becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower because of the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for the constriction of the chest, and for the rupture of the windpipe, and for cough, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
Cupping at the second rib of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to press his hand on it when he places it, so that he does not cut the artery and cause a great flow of blood.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as good as the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the phlebotomist not to go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and has nerves and arteries beneath.
The cupping glass which is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for the illnesses below, and the cupping glass should be large, and be of brass, that it may draw well; and perhaps, if it were thin, it would break; and makes large wounds there.
Cupping on the legs heals openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the loins, and of the womb, and of the bladder, and restore menstruation;
and are applied to the two veins and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and bring on paralysis in many instances.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and apply it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and reapply the cupping glasses, and take heed of the constitution of the bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores: then it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the passage of thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, then it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw blood little by little, then one time is sufficient for us. And if we want a lot of blood, then we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, then strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or with sweet almond oil, or with gourd seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take wormwood oil, or balm oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one whom one heals has tender flesh and large pores, then it is not necessary to put on any oil, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or gourd water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And he who has much moisture, let him rise with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise with old wine, or beet juice, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or others similar;
and one should not use cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be warm, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chickens, and the flesh of a wether, and moist meats.
and eat chickens, and the flesh of a wether, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he is bled, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after bloodletting, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not necessary that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping glasses that are applied without cutting are those that are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the breast and the kidneys and the hip, for those members do not tolerate being cut, and it is only done to draw blood from member to member, just as we apply them to the breasts when the milk flows;
to remove the viscosity that is in the member, just as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the breast to soften the member;
and removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are applied empty to suck only; and sometimes they are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled for this.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as if to insert a needle, and let it be of bronze, smooth on the front so that it does not wound the patient when placing it on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to put a lit candle in, and let there be both large and small ones according to the illnesses and the age of those who receive them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of the elderly, and of the thin from the fat.
And one must thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and put it into the cupping glass across the bar which is in the cupping glass, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor goes in, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and recommences often, if you have need.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with acute (fever), there is no bar or hole, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only;
and this is the form:
Leech-cups are not administered except in limbs where one cannot place cupping glasses because of their smallness, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or toes, and others similar;
and the quality of the user is such that when you find leeches that are in clear fresh water without corruption, you take them;
and put them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled with a vein and cupping glass, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for that is very beneficial afterwards.
If not, raise the area with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then wipe it.
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches fall off, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it until the bleeding stops;
and if the bleeding is excessive, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it stops;
or you may put on the area halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the area, this will stop it immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches will not take hold, rub the area with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood comes out, and then apply them, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach themselves;
and when you see that they fall off, sprinkle a little alum and salt, or ashes, they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fracture and dislocation.
Know, dear son, that foolish people stray from this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letter of them;
and for this reason the science is estranged in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of the ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and by experiment, and by the custom of my life;
and I have described for you in this chapter that which is contained, and have abridged it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in the two chapters above.
It is necessary then that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture, dislocation, torsion, or bruise comes to someone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or infants, or old men; or if the time is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold things, that is to say cold meats, and the flesh of birds and of kid, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no fear of a hot abscess, or of the spreading of matter in the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that provide strong nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and paunch of cow, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the flesh is repaired and the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of the old and the decrepit cannot be well repaired nor knit according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor those also who are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but, in treatment, reset the broken bone with thick bandages which support and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not take away from its work, and for that reason it is necessary to nourish it with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another in a sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another in a sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small fissure.
And each manner has its device, and its proper instrument in restoration, according to that which the memory brings to its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known by this, that the place is twisted, and appears well by swelling, and sounds upon the pressure of the hand;
and when there is no twisting nor sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, then there is no fracture;
but there may well be a twisting, or fissure, or small fracture. Then it is not necessary that you move it with your hand, but apply the medicines which follow, and then restrain it subtly for now.
And know that for a fracture that goes spirally, and the two parts are disjointed, it is necessary to set them evenly, before abscesses form there;
and if hot abscesses form, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are calmed;
then set it evenly so that you can easily and wisely, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then restrain it, as is necessary afterwards.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, stretch it from two sides, if it is the hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, bring back by all means the additions to their places as well as you can, and take care that by your work no injury or pain comes to the patient;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
then straighten it beautifully, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause by their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is in place, instruct the patient well that he not move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, nor by turning, nor in any other manner; and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is put straight, that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in largeness and in form.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and the like: then it is necessary to wrap it in soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap it with a wide and strong bandage, for the wide bandages embrace the whole large limb, and constrict it equally on all sides, so that there is no slack;
then bind around light tow, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture then moves the fracture a little;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and turn it again over the broken area;
then return to the area below the fracture, and tighten it moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the bandages linen tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind all over with a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something warm that soothes the abscess and reduces the swelling, and leave it like that for a few days;
then tighten your splints, and let them be half of a wisely chosen broad cane, or of wood from which clefts are made, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then tighten the splints as you did in the first binding, then tie over them a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less;
and it is necessary that the threads be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too subtle, and it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth of space between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after the tightening in healthy places, put under them linen tow or carded wool, so that he does not get hurt.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints until after five or seven days, or more depending on your certainty of a hot abscess supervening;
And here is the manner of the ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with plenty of egg, and apply this confection, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring fractures in several situations, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take 3 of each of bdellium, leadwort, enula, asafoetida, gum arabic, and mugwort, 10 drams each; myrrh and aloes, 5 drams each; comfrey 9 drams; and make them into a powder, and mix them with egg white; If the man's complexion is hot, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is useful to many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for a sprain: take mugwort and mallow, each 10 drams; myrrh and aloes, each 9 drams; acacia 6 drams; Armenian bole 10 drams, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply.
Another kind of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and the chipping of the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply it to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes the pain.
Another kind of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves, and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another kind of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and for diminishing the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, bean flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and apply it.
Another kind of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take mallow roots, and flaxseed, balauste, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all one part each; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its condition.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb for restoration anything but a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else besides, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to think that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: take mugwort and human hair cut up, or bird feathers, and mallow, and mix them equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it on.
And then unbind it a little afterwards, and take care if the patient feels no pain, nor has the bone moved from its place; if not, unbind it in several days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, without rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take light linen cloth, and a moistened sea sponge, and dip it in water, and bathe the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind on a nut, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then recommence the subtle binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you need plaster and binding, then begin again, just as you did before equally.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it twenty days, depending on what one sees, until the fracture heals, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then restrain it more than before, and it will thicken its flesh, as I have said before;
and if you see the place drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it; then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and that should be every third day, and loosen the bandage a little;
by this work then nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and hastens the mending of what foolish doctors do, who bind the limb too tightly:
that is bad, and it is dangerous work, and I see nothing else but letting it be and working correctly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and various forms, and the causes are different;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks all the bone down to the periosteum which is beneath the bone, as an axe or a club does; and for that reason this kind of fracture is called "hachure".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt impact, or a fissure, or from a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or from other similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is a crack in the bone as fine as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives a piece of the bone inwards, and the place is swollen as the blacksmiths do when they strike the cauldrons; if the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft bones in the head, like the head of a child;
and it happens in all these types of fracture that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is on top.
Hair-like resemblance is known by this: when the bone has been uncovered, and one rubs against it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and convulsions, and fainting, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar symptoms in various conditions, then it cannot heal without a doubt.
And if you see no frightening symptoms, and you hope for healing, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded man first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the symptoms that we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, it is necessary that you split the split part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and over the surface of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs upon uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are sure of the cessation of bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of working:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are of tempered iron;
and work lightly, that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you administer incisions with chisels, not so deeply that it pierces beyond the skull bone, and it should have a margin or a circle above the point, so that it does not allow the point to pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes to its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have chisels for the whole skull;
and this is the form of the three types of chisels:
The method for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a chisel on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the chisel elsewhere a little afterwards, and thus do it all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you extract the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, it is necessary that you remove the remaining bone fragments with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or splinters remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen described, which is safer; and he praises it highly, and that is his word. First you must uncover a part of the bone where the broken part appears moved, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And it does not cut on one side, and the part is sharpened on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is adhered to the bone, remove it lightly, for one removes it well without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and the bone is only cut on top, and there are small pieces, then you must remove that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So begin with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle breaks, you must apply a remedy according to its condition;
and this is something that is not readily known to one who has not applied themselves to this art.
And if the syfac is uncovered, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another doubled cloth, in two or three layers, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so as not to injure the syfac, then apply another bandage on top, and do not bind it tightly except enough to hold the wound only;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and bean flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medicines without biting;
and guard that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment on it, nor allow pus to gather, for when pus gathers on the brain's membrane, it corrupts and rots it, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when one puts something biting on the syfac, it becomes numb on top. Take care then, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness comes there only because of the medicine that has been put on, that it has such a virtue, then you must take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil and glue one cloth to it, and put it on the syfac; then cure it with the appropriate methods of treatment, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one by itself alone, for they are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger in the hole of the nose, and set the fracture even with your index finger, and with the little finger on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it even with the head of a slightly thick rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, do the same, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then put into the nasal head tents of linen cloths, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you place one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a confection of egg white and mill powder; then leave the tent until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient blows through it; or do what you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or a little diachylon there.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, apply a plaster externally, of barley flour and incense powder, cooked with egg white, then put light lint on top, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract it with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead wires in it, until it is healed.
When the jawbone is broken below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two, except perhaps inwardly, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jawbone, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently push the fracture inwards, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the jawbone is separated into two, it is necessary that you apply traction from two sides, until it is even.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, bind them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then apply cerate to the broken jawbone, and place a double cloth over it; and place on the cloth a well-made large plaster, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jawbone, and bind it on as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and apply a plaster, of mill powder with egg white or chickpea flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; many times it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses appear, administer what we have often said.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of the bone is removed; if so, carefully remove it with instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew up the wound, if it is wide, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The fracture often breaks in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
or it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken fracture; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the form is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor displacement.
And if you need to extend more, then place under the patient's shoulder a round sphere of cloth, or of wool, and let it be large according to your necessity; and extend and lift the clavicle, and pull the sphere with your hand, so that you set the fracture evenly, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the clavicle outwards, because it goes in deeply, then the patient must lie often on his back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the attendant pushes the shoulder down, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must make an incision.
and pull the pieces out gently, and if the bone cannot join because of some obstacle, then cut it with one of the knives that you have; but that you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the soft parts:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the nature of the work;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cut the wound, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses appear, moisten a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of ground powder and egg white, and put light tampons on top, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a palm wide, then place a double cloth over the tampons and the plaster; then take a thin strip three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the strip on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and tighten it from each side, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the strip does not move on the broken bone, then check it each day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under the armpit while he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will lighten the fracture of the clavicle by easing the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is needed, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is healed;
and it is healed in at most twenty-eight days, and in less time for some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks either at the broad part or in the middle, and it is not known except by touch;
then set it according to the form of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can;
then put on the place powdered millstone with abundant egg white, and light tampons, and put on a double cloth; then put on a broad and thin splint, a little broader than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is hair in any place on the shoulder, fill that hair with linen tampons, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the limb each day;
and every time that it loosens, bind it, and make the splint even if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number of days is complete, unbind it, and be certain, for it is not a bone that easily dislocates.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and points below the heart, make an incision there, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breast
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and coughing, and perhaps vomits blood, and the broken bone is clearly felt, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and one puts a cushion between his shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs of the two sides with your hands, and subtly put it equally in all ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and lint over the fracture with fine salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage round the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it is necessary to untie it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and treat what has come there in the manner of treatments;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only occurs in large places behind the back, and at the chest inside, and they only bend because they are slippery; and one feels it well upon examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is such that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need it.
And if the rib fracture is inwardly displaced, the patient feels very great pain and a stabbing pain, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and quickly vomits a large amount of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have devised great remedies for it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outwards.
We do not do this, so that hot abscesses do not form, if they have not already formed. And if they have formed, then treat them.
And some say that one should apply cupping glasses to the area, to draw out strongly, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might attract superfluities to the area due to its weakness.
And some say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in warm oil, and place tents between the ribs to distribute the bandage evenly around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with poultices and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because of the bone that pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open above the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the viscera;
and then one must cut the bone, and draw it out gently, and then sew the two lips of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses occur, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area in the meantime as is necessary for an abscess, and let the patient lie often on the side where it is, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, see if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortal in many ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is taken.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, see if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are there which are in the hands, and on the back there is flatulence and involuntary evacuation;
and when he is turned on his belly, there is involuntary evacuation. And when he is turned on his back and wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortal. Therefore do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the condition is milder.
And the cure is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to the spine until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut over the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "cow's head", if you put your little finger of your left hand there, and set it even with the other hand to your ability, then apply the plaster and the compress on top, if you need it;
then pull it out, and if there are separated bones, cut into it, and remove them, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a slight reduction at the head; and it breaks lengthwise, and slopes inwards, and the patient experiences pain at the site, and throbbing, and swelling where it is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are over the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, set the fracture evenly, until it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it slopes inwards, make the patient lie on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, apply the plaster, then place a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the binding is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses appear there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are subsided, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as necessary, if there are no bad accidents;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight stick of moderate thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place his broken arm on the stick, until it reaches the armpit, and have a wooden curve in the middle, then hang some heavy thing or let the assistant stretch it downwards;
then let the physician set the fracture evenly with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one suspends the patient on his bed, and ties his hand to his neck, then instructs two assistants that one holds what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below with a cord, and each stretches to his side.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, pull a cord from below the fracture, and above the fracture, and let each of the assistants stretch to his side.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must place a cord in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then you must place a cord lightly, without effort, until the fracture is even on the place, and on the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and pull it, if no hot abscesses appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then do not pull it until seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then pull it, and the manner of pulling is that you put the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm on the shoulder, and put your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and put the cloth, and pull on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone might move, then use splints, and put on the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and let there be one inch of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it passes the fracture three inches on each side;
then pull on the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less in moving away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, at the time that you restore the broken limb, and you doubt a hot abscess, then let it alone until the seventh day, as we have said;
then look every three days at the bandage, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight. If so, adjust it, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not untie it before three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder a cushion full of wool evenly, and look every hour of the day or night, that the position of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then adjust it by the virtue of medicine, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is at first subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be healed in forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it takes fifty days or two months to unbind.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "foscile", of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the little finger;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is below, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile alone is broken, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be extended slightly, and set equal.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be pulled more strongly;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no labor;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the lower part at his hand, or at a linen cloth, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture it is broken into pieces, then put each one in its place, and if there is any separated piece that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the singular chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the resetting, hot abscesses occur, then apply a cloth of cerate made of rose oil and white wax, that it be neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster of the mill's powder with abundant egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and pull more on the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as it moves away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident befalls the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with warm water, until that itching is calmed;
and do not allow the limb to rest tightly.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bones separated, and similar things, then correct it.
And take care that nourishment can reach the limb, for if it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands on his neck, and let his neck be straight, and beware of movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-five, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and in the knuckles of the fingers, there are few fractures, and only bending often occurs there.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, then it is necessary that the patient sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him equally;
then he puts his hand on the outstretched cloth, and the assistant stretches the broken bones, and aligns them, until they are well joined;
and applies the plaster and lint, if no abscesses occur, then he applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the palm of the hand, make a sling of cloths, and instruct the patient to hold it to his broken palm; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as is necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, it is necessary that you place one splint above and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the thumb, set it straight as is necessary; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, put a small straight splint to lift the fracture, so that it does not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight and bind it with the healthy finger that is next to it; or you bind them all together in an "I" shape, whichever is better, or you put on a splint, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and in the treatment of a hot abscess, and help what comes of it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns front and back;
and the restoration is that one binds one band above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his bandage to his part equally;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the bandages be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And likewise if it is close to the knee, and then let the bandage be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone equally with his two hands, until it is according to its natural form, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses arise there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The ligature is made in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap around the fracture a doubled hard bandage in two or three layers, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then place splints on the fracture, and place a splint on the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening even, then begin to tie firmly three or four turns above the fracture; and the further you go above the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then take the two ends of the thread that you have placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie with them the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it so, until neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it occurs, untie it, and treat what appears, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, it is necessary to open the place and draw out the pus; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
however, in the restoration thus made the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in L days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is rarely a fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a crack, or a hole, and it happens with a wound, and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round to its sides, until it is assembled as much as one can;
then put the plaster, and put a round splint there, if you need it, and bind it as is necessary, then observe all the provisions that we have mentioned in other fractures, such as a hot abscess and other similar things; then apply to each accident what it requires, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "mustelz", and the other is called "foscile";
and the fracture happens just as it does in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is entirely similar. And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns in every direction.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it well; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
but however, if the fracture is bad, and there are several pieces, the extension must be less and lighter; and lighten it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on one side and the other, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap in two places one bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg cannot deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, which is of wood, and into which the leg is placed to prevent movement, and this is properly done in fractures where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; heal it until it is whole.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, fracture does not occur, but at the bones of the foot, fracture sometimes occurs and at the toes also, and nothing but crepitation occurs in several ways.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, then have the patient put his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their places;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two full inches, then bind the foot properly, after you have wrapped cloths around, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, unbind the ligature, for you will find the bones equal, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then put on the broken toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board that I have mentioned, and bind it properly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be resting on the top of the board above the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each complication as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, make her sit widely spread, then incline her to the back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the woman's genitals with cotton, and put in as much as will fit;
then stand the woman up, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton will jump, until it comes to the entrance of the genitals, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a string to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the genitals; then blow strongly into the string, until the bladder is inflated inside; in this way the fracture will be returned to its place;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden from one who applies himself and uses his skill, and attends to my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right way of restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's gullet and put the penis inside it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or until it heals, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with a wound
It is necessary for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as a bone in the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, so that the healings that we have mentioned testify to it.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if hot abscesses do not appear.
And if hot abscesses appear, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place lightly with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not sufficient for you to set it with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the surgeon to have three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb in your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," therefore it is necessary that the curved head be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even on both sides. And if the fracture is small, and the instrument cannot easily grasp the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, whether incisor or saw, as you are able;
then smooth what remains of the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
Then work until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and properly if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer a bandage when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the bandages be softer and smoother than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad complications may arise, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, then you must not put on bandages; but wrap around, instead of bandages, stiff cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove what you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but repeatedly suppurates, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore it is necessary that you cleanse the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces that cause that pain.
And if a fistula develops there, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what is said in the chapter before this.
And when the bone is broken, and open on the limb, like the bone of the thigh or shoulder, and others similar of the large limbs, do not pull it out, for many times death results, but leave it until it rots;
by chance it will fall out after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many swellings come after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and the appearance of the limb is an ugly thing to see; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take heed then if the bone is fresh: administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and apply them to the wound on lint, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin another, until the inflammation is gone;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation has already turned to hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it, and remove the excess that appears; or you shave it with a razor until it is gone, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is healed, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of a multitude of dressings; or because of too much movement, or not at the right time; or because he has little blood in his body, and is weak.
And the cure is that you make the patient eat, and make the body supple, until the blood is multiplied in him; and give him baths, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch draws great nourishment to it, and often bathe it with warm water, until nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the broken bones are exposed, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one must break the limb anew, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, they must be bathed in warm water, or softening herbs should be cooked, such as mallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and cook it with hen grease or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;
or you take fat figs, and crush them with dog dung, and similar medicines that soften the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by continuously and long rubbing with moistened hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a sharp incisor lightly; and put skill and care into the treatment.
Dislocation is the departure of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and injury.
When a dislocation occurs to someone, it must be immediately reset without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one resets it with difficulty;
therefore one must not move it at the time that it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are calmed;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it returns to its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It happens that the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: or they are a little out of place, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth which he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is slight, it returns by itself in several ways.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a manner that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts the tips of his fingers of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the mandible inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides; and the other two fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the assistant puts it even, until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if it is both mandibles together, then bathe them with warm water and oil, until they are softened slightly;
and do not delay in the reduction, as we have said.
And when they are equally reduced, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths moistened in a cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head should be supported between two cushions, so that he does not move it to the right or to the left, nor does he strain to chew, but let him take light food, until the pains are relieved, and the mandibles are healed;
and then let him eat what he wants lightly, and let him not strain to open his mouth when eating and drinking, until the mandible is well healed and sound.
And if the two mandibles cannot be repositioned at once, and are not restored to their place, then fever and accustomed swelling result, and perhaps diarrhea, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal; and many times he who suffers this dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards the ribcage and breast, and it is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder that is towards the side cannot be dislocated; except a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it in its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until healed;
and in the same way is the shoulder joint reset, when it is dislocated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate backwards by the shoulder, nor inwards by the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in these it leaps hastily;
in those who have enough flesh, it leaps scarcely, and returns scarcely.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and one thinks that it is dislocated because of that.
It is necessary then that you test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lowered towards the armpit, and it shows a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit, on touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly on touching;
and this kind of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant raises the patient's hand upwards, then places his thumbs under the armpit, and forcefully raises the joint upwards into place; and the attendant raises the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it underneath; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water; and the attendant apply a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and let it be applied;
then let the patient be placed on his back, and place under the armpit a wool pad of even thickness, neither too soft nor too hard, then let the physician place his heel on the pad, and raise the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pull the hand of the patient;
and another attendant hold the head of the patient, so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder returns immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and that you have present a man who is larger than the patient; and let him be positioned towards the side, and place his shoulder under the armpit of the patient, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pull the hand of the patient downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with some heavy thing, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one thrusts a long firebrand into the earth, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but so that it has soft cloths on top, and the patient stands along the length of the wood;
then let his hand be pulled down firmly on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two spans long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter easily deep under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths on the head of the wood, so that the wood does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the length of the wood, and tie the shoulder to the wood, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of suitable width, and let the hand hang down, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever way it may be, you must place under the armpit an equal sphere of wool, then apply the prepared plaster of mill powder, with incense and egg white, over the whole shoulder and around it, then bind it tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And he must eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must administer cautery to three points, as it is described in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast and the nipples, or behind, is caused by an impulsion and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after the healing comes stiffness in the limb, and slowness in movement, then the patient should use a bath many times, until that stiffness is alleviated, and returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one can see it well and feel it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is broken, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And it is necessary that you reset it before hot abscesses come, for if hot abscesses were to come, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reset, especially when it is in the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and perhaps death ensues.
And the restoration is, when it is such that one can reset it, that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms should be spread out, and the hands of the observer around the elbow, above and below, and put the joint to its parts together, or at the root of the palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm at the elbow which is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the physician has joined the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint forcefully, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the binding, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the binding, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you place on the joint a poultice of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and have him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then replace the poultice, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, apply warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
then it will return to its proper position.
The dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be reduced quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place swells, or a hot abscess forms.
And the reduction is that you place the afflicted hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and you place it evenly, so that he puts his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, it is necessary that you look to see if it is well in place; then let the patient place the back of his hand on a table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, let the patient place the back of his hand on the table, and let the physician place his hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is well. If not, bind it with soothing plasters for hot abscesses, and leave it thus without disturbing it.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, then the joint remains crooked;
and it harms the patient not at all except insofar as the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves or arteries are severed;
there is no other remedy except to cauterize near the affected area, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is any stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the inside.
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even on that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do likewise if it is dislocated on the inside of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
Of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or of the neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocated, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions jump out without will, nor can he hold them, and often some limb is softened, or the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
That which moves backwards is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you observe if the gibbosity came from infancy: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from blows or similar things, the ancients said cures by great words, where there is not much profit in all;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have devised instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast in front, there is no device or health;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which properly comes on the back, as I said;
and it is that the patient be laid on his face in a level place, and have straw beneath him, that he not be injured;
then stick one brand in the ground firmly, and another at the feet, and tie one rope over the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two brands;
and be firmly fixed, the brands as we have said, and the physician place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician put his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that turns by hand. And it is that you insert two brands at the head of the patient of a large arm's length, and towards the feet two others, and let there be between each brand, above and below, a palm's breadth of space in length;
and let there be in each brand one hole, where the lathe runs, and let the brands be firmly in the earth, so that they do not move;
and between each two brands let there be one turning brand, upon which the ropes turn, and let there be on the two turning brands two small brands a palm's length long, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the rope which is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with the whole rope, and the master places the splinter evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, then put on a drying plaster with plenty of egg white, and then the lint, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the place of the gibbosity and the part of the healthy vertebra, then bind it with a rope, as we have said, and let the patient use subtle nourishment, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the last vertebra of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone which appears, therefore one should not be presumptuous: by chance it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, not as with the other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward than elsewhere, and little dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the affected leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the affected knee appears more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of the one to whom it happens outwardly, is that these accidents are contrary to those above.
And the signs of the one to whom it happens in front, are that he extends his leg well according to the completion; however, he does not bend his knee without pain, and if one wants to make him go forward, he cannot, and he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of the one to whom it happens behind, are that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place below the ribs.
The treatment of this kind of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure; and it is not necessary that there be presumption.
And in him whose dislocation is fresh, and this is of the four kinds of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance it will return, and there is no need for other treatment.
And if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a linen bandage tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a manner that he puts his hands under his armpits, then binds him with a soft linen cloth above the thigh; and another holds the head of the bandage;
and they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar [cases], and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then it is necessary to apply a similar treatment.
When the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that you place the patient on his healthy side, then place the bandage on the root of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin, then extend the bandage upwards towards the groin, and towards the clavicle;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards strongly; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than others.
And if you cannot set it in the manner we have described, then you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft bandage above the two heels and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be hung from the head of a pole, and let it be two arms-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately and quickly.
And when the dislocation is reduced, let the patient lie down, as we have said for one with gibbosity, and tightly wrap a bandage around the affected leg properly, and also around the foot;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and another at the feet, then insert a firebrand between the patient's thighs in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant extend towards him, and let the physician equally with his hand set the dislocation.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said in gibbosity, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the physician put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, or to raise it from the ground, but it must be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint at the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are even; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are even, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg at his thigh, and if it does not bend at his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg at his thigh easily;
and apply the plaster, and make the leg bend at the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient should not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not straight, administer strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes twisted, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and tense towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only twisted.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and gently place the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by placing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is good;
If not, then begin the work again, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot in their hands or with a rope, which they tie above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when they are extended;
then let the physician equally set the dislocation with their hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then put the plaster and lint on, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves that are on the ankle behind, that the binding not be too tight;
then leave it two or three days, and if the binding loosens, then tighten it;
then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses arise, then you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without effort, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any knuckle of the back of the foot, then you must have the patient sit on a level place or on a completely straight table, and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing protrudes, then place a two-legged table under the sole of the foot, then bind it firmly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and make him rest until he is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times it happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning of things soothing warm applications, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of healing; and when you see hope, then immediately restore the limb to its place, before the warm applications come there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer soothing warm applications, and treat the wound, as is fitting, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then remove them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and guard yourself from entering into the path of fear, according to what I have said, for it is better for you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body.
