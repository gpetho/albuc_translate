of the fracture of the wrist bone
When the bone of a woman's hip is broken, have her sit spread-legged, then lean her back, and be held from behind;
then the practitioner fills the patient's vagina with cotton, and puts in as much as a fist;
then have the woman stand, and lift her back little by little, and then the cotton jumps out, until it comes to the opening of the vagina, and the bone returns with the wad;
and when she needs to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for seven days or thereabouts:
thus the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a tube to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the vagina;
then blow strongly into the tube, until the bladder is inflated inside:
the vagina will return to its place, the fracture; 
then it should be filled with cotton, and left like that for some days, until it is healed.
And when the wrist bone of a man, or of a woman, is broken, restore it as we have described for the hip bone;
and these fractures, close together, are not hidden from him who applies his study and practice, and understands my book.
For the fracture itself, in many arrangements, indicates the right way to restore it:
understand it then.
For the penis, when it is broken, take a goose quill and place the penis inside;
then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will be quickly healed.
