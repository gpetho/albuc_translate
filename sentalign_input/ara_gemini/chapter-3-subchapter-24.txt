Chapter Twenty-Four on the Treatment of Dislocation of the Lower Jaw
Rarely do the jaws dislocate except in rare cases.
And their dislocation occurs in one of two ways:
Either they shift from their places slightly, so they relax a little,
or they dislocate completely, so they relax towards the chest until the patient's saliva flows and he cannot hold it back, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stammers when speaking.
So if the dislocation is slight, it may return to its place on its own in most cases with minimal effort.
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all.
This is done by having an assistant hold the patient's head, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside his mouth if the jaw is dislocated on one side, or inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and with the rest of his fingers on the outside, he adjusts it and orders the patient to relax his jaw and let it go in every direction, and the physician adjusts and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, use a compress with hot water and oil until their reduction is easy, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said.
So when they have returned and straightened and the patient's mouth has closed and they do not relax, then place on them pads of cloth with cerate made from wax and rose oil, then tie them gently with a loose bandage.
And the patient should sleep on his back with his head supported between two pillows so that he does not move it right or left and does not strain to chew anything, but makes his food a soft soup.
Until the pain is gone and the jaw is firm, let him eat what he pleases.
And let him do that gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is firm and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult when they dislocate at some point and do not return to their places, fevers and persistent headaches often occur from that, and perhaps the patient's bowels loosen, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
So if you see that, know that he is damaged, and often one who experiences that dies within ten days.
