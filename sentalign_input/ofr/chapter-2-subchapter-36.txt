of abscesses of the throat
Sometimes lumps come inside the throat which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the section (or chapter), and they are not healed, then take note:
if it is a hard abscess with little feeling and a dark color, do not touch it with iron (a surgical instrument).
And if it is red and the base is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the risk of bleeding;
but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will rupture on its own;
and if it is a round white color, and the base is thin, have the instrument ready to cut, but first check if the abscess is calm and appeased.
Then have the patient sit facing the sun, with their head in your lap, have them open their mouth, and have the assistant take their head between their hands and press the tongue down with the instrument, the shape of which is shown here;
and it should be made of silver or thin brass like a knife:
When you press the tongue down with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out above as much as you can;
and pull some of the tissue with it, then cut it with the instrument, the shape of which is shown here, that looks like scissors;
and the tips are curved, and one towards the other, and are very sharp, and made of Indian steel or hardened steel:
And if you do not have this instrument available, cut it with forceps/pincers, of which the shape is shown here:
And let it be sharp on one side, and not on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same way, and after the incision, have the patient gargle with hot water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water, in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped;
then treat him until he is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, so cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that was inside her throat, that is to say, an abscess of little sensation;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and she could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained that way for a day or two.
And the abscess had risen so high that two tubes had been placed through the two nostrils.
I therefore acted quickly and inserted a hook into one of them, then pulled it out, and drew out a large amount of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and I worked her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the hook into these abscesses, and cut a part of them, and only a little blood came out;
and thus the woman's throat passage was opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not stop cutting this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess kept growing back, filling the space that I had emptied, until it was very large again;
then I tricked it and cauterized it inside the throat:
thus it stopped growing;
and I left those parts, and I don't know what God did with her after me.
