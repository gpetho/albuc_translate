 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE.
On cauterization of the axilla.
 When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrenceâ€”it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards.
Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.
Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations.
 The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns.
The prongs should be of the fineness of a probe.
This is the figure of the cautery with three prongs.
Sometimes there is added yet one more so there will be eight burns.
Put on the burns leeks well pounded with salt; then keep the patient absolutely quiet so as not to move the joint for a time till it gains strength.
If the dislocation has gone upwards, which very rarely happens, then cauterize him above the shoulder with one good claviform cautery or with multiple punctured cauterizations.
Thus the joint will gain strength and the humidity will disappear and the patient will be cured.
