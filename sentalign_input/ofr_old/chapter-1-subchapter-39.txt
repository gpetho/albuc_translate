of the uterus
When the womb is cold and moist, not preventing conception, and the menses are corrupted and their periods are delayed; and when they come, great pain is felt: then make three cauteries around the navel, as mentioned in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the back; and let the cauteries be clavile, as mentioned.
