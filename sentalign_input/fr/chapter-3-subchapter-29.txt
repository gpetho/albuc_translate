Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand  
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in all directions, sometimes on the back of the palm or the front.  
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the tip of the finger, and hang it towards the side where it is dislocated.  
And leave it for two days, then set it properly that day; and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and rebind it at night; and do this often until it is stable.  
And do the same if it is dislocated to the front of the hand, and do as you did before until it is healed; and do the same when it is dislocated elsewhere.
