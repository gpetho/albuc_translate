On wounds of the belly and the emergence of the intestines and their exit.
Chapter 87.
The rupture that happens to the belly is great, moderate, or small.
From a great rupture, sometimes the intestine or a number of intestines comes out.
Therefore, their reinsertion and suturing become more forceful and difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
It follows, then, that their reinsertion becomes more difficult if you do not immediately replace them in their place, for they swell, open, and enlarge, making reentry difficult.
Because of this, a moderate rupture is better, for with it the reinsertion of the intestine is not as difficult as in these two other types.
Know that suturing of the belly is done in four ways.
Two common sutures are suitable for suturing the belly and other wounds of the body; two other sutures specifically pertain to other wounds.
However, they are more proper for the suturing of the belly; I will describe each with explanation and clarification.
I say, therefore, that when the wound is small and something of the intestine comes out of it, making it difficult to replace, this is due to one of two reasons.
Either because of the small size of the rupture, as we have said, or because of swelling in the intestine due to the cold air.
When it is so, then it is necessary to warm it, by immersing a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone.
Or boil squinant, cyperus, and spike in water, and bathe the intestine with it until the swelling subsides.
Sometimes wine with astringency achieves this, and it is better than plain water for reducing swelling.
When you see the swelling subsiding, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
For by this, its entry is eased with little difficulty.
If, however, its return is delayed after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
And the initial treatment is better when prepared than cutting, so that there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and lack of instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the fine end should not be as fine as a needle but rather slightly blunt, resembling the cauda, as you see.
When, therefore, the wound is widened and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that it be returned to its natural form in its proper place if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then the patient must lie on their back, with their legs elevated higher than their head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if there is a rupture in one of the two sides of the belly, then always set your attention and consideration on this, that the part with the wound is higher than the other part.
And so you must handle it in this way in large wounds and in moderate wounds.
However, in small wounds, place it as it has been prepared for you.
Then make sure you have a diligent assistant present who will hold the entire rupture with his hand and bring its edges together.
Then uncover it for the one who follows with the suturing, little by little; this is the method of one common suture.
And it is to take a needle, or a number of needles, according to the size of the wound.
Then leave a space the width of a ring finger, that is, a physician’s finger, from the edge of the rupture, and place one needle by inserting the thread into the two edges of the skin, with the two edges of the tissue beneath the skin from the inside, until it penetrates from the other side, and now you have joined the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the tissue, forming four layers.
Then bind with double thread around the needle several times from both sides together, until the two edges of the wound are decently joined.
Then leave the width of a finger again, and insert another needle into them; afterward, stitch it with thread as you did with the first needle.
Do not cease doing this with the necessary needles until you complete the entire constriction of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness and fineness, for very fine needles cut the flesh quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore, they should be medium in fineness and thickness.
It should not happen that the needle is placed too close in the two edges of the skin so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound does not open before it consolidates; nor should it be too far apart, so that the wound is not hindered from consolidating.
Then cut off the ends of the needles, so they do not harm the patient while sleeping; and place small cloth pads around them to hold the ends of the needles, and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And this type of suturing with needles in this way is more suitable for small wounds.
For it is sufficient to use one or two needles in the suturing of these.
The second common suture, however, is to join with suturing the four edges: two edges of the skin and two edges of the tissue at once, with a needle that has an even thread in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have penetrated with the needle through these four edges, return the needle to the side where you began so that the thread lies across the top part of the wound, so that the suture resembles the stitch of a garment that binds fabric, and place between each suture the width of a little finger.
And men know this suture.
And with this suture, I closed a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was larger than a palm, and about two palms of his intestine had come out from the middle intestine, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.
I therefore returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for 24 hours.
The wound thus healed in a span of about 15 days; I treated him, and he was healed, and he lived many years afterward, going about his daily affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not recover.
And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
For I was in a place where no ointment or any medicines were available.
Therefore, I placed old cotton over the wound twice a day and regularly washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will describe two types of specific sutures according to the narrative.
And it is that you begin with a sharp suture and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
When the needle penetrates the skin and goes into the muscle along the length and width of the whole body, leave the end of the tissue on the side where you inserted the needle and make it penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside on the opposite side of the muscle.
Then, once you have made it penetrate, make it penetrate again in the same way, in the same end of the muscle from the outside to the inside; leave the tissue end on this side, and insert the needle into the other end from the inside to the outside, making it penetrate as you pass it through the tissue at the muscle end on that side until it penetrates it fully.
Then start again from this same side and stitch it with the tissue end that is on the other side, and pull the needle out of the skin it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin and sew the tissue end on the other side with this end of the muscle, and pull it out of the skin on that side, and do this turn by turn, one after another, until you have stitched the entire external part according to that pattern.
And the essence of this suture is that it resembles the stitch of leatherworkers when they stitch hides, so that you stitch the tissue in one turn on one edge of the skin and leave it on the other side in the next turn until complete.
The second type of specific suture, which Galen described.
This instruction was narrated as stitching it in the way some physicians do, joining each part to its naturally fitting counterpart, applying each tissue end to its corresponding end and each muscle end to its opposite end.
And that is done as I am telling you.
You should insert the needle into the closest muscle end from the outside and make it penetrate inward in that area alone, leaving both tissue ends.
Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside through both tissue ends on both sides.
Then turn both again, making both ends penetrate from the inside to the outside in the two other muscle ends on the opposite side.
And this method of suturing is better than the common simple suture, and it is the one previously mentioned.
This is thus also Galen’s instruction.
And some have said.
The belly suture is done with two needles.
This means inserting a single thread into both needles, beginning by inserting the needle from the side closest to you and making it penetrate to the other side, as in the suture of those who sew leather evenly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
And the judgment of treating the wound is the same as for other wounds.
This is because, when you reach a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you return the intestine, sew it, and position it, then apply a healing powder over it.
But if the air has already altered the wound, then place some ointments over it, those available to you, until they produce pus, the threads fall off, and the tissue and muscle consolidate.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds, until it is healed.
If you do not have medicines available, then immediately place old cotton over it once it starts emitting pus, and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
For you do not need other medication in many situations when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound might spread to the principal members with injury, then it is necessary to soak soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil, and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If he feels pain, pricks, or rotting in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema with astringent, dark, warm wine, especially if the rot has already reached the intestine, and an exit wound has formed penetrating to its cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine heals more easily, while one in the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
The intestine called the jejunum does not heal at all from a wound that happens to it; this is because of its numerous veins, their size, the thinness of its structure, and its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if what emerges from the wound is the omentum, and you encounter it fresh, return it in the same manner by which you return intestines evenly.
But if time has passed and it has turned green or black, then you must tie it with thread above the area that has darkened, to prevent blood flow.
For in the omentum there are veins and arteries.
Then cut off what is beyond that ligature, and leave two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the drawing and extraction of it at the point of the omentum can be eased for you, along with the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Recollection of a wound that happened in the intestine.
When a rupture happens in the intestine and is small, it is possible for it to be restored in some people; I saw a man who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of his stomach, and the wound became chronic and formed a fistula, from which waste and air escaped.
I therefore applied treatment, though I was not confident in his healing; I did not stop attending to him until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place was consolidated, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen in his belly, but no bad event befell him.
And he remained in good condition, eating, drinking, engaging in intercourse, entering the bath, and exercising in his diet.
And some practitioners have said that when there is a wound in the intestine, and it is small, it should be tied in this way.
And it is to take ants with large heads.
Then bring the two edges of the wound together, and place one of these ants, which has its jaws open, over the two edges of the wound.
When it bites down and closes its jaws, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not release.
Then place another ant close to the first, and continue doing this ant after ant according to the length of the entire wound.
Then return it and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine nourishes itself and heals, and no harm whatsoever comes to the patient.
And it is possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread, which is derived from an animal intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into a needle.
And it is to take the end of this thread from the intestine and thoroughly remove the flesh.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Then insert that thread into the needle and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it to the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only a matter of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, has no solution except attentive care, nor can it be healed at all.
