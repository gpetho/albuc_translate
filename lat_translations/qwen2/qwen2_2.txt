Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After completing this book for you, my children, which is the final part of the science in medicine with its supplement, and having reached the end of it from his explanations and own declarations, I consider it necessary to complete it for you together with this Treatise which is a part of operations, that is, surgery with practice.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the operation with practice is located in our region and time, entirely separated from us: until perhaps knowledge of it disappears and its investigation ceases. There remained nothing from that except small descriptions in ancient books which were changed by hands: they are thus prone to error and hesitation until their intentions are closed and their strength elongated. I consider it necessary to revive this by organizing this Treatise according to the path of position, declaration, and abbreviation: And to provide it with forms of Cauter's tools and other surgical instruments. As an addition from declarations and as a clarification of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why it is not found a good craftsman of this skill with his own hand in our times is: because the art of medicine requires one to be proficient beforehand in the science of anatomy as described by Galen, so that he may understand the functions of organs, their forms, and connections, and know about bones, nerves, blood vessels, their numbers, and exit locations. And also pulsating veins and quiet ones, and the places from where they exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this, said Hippocrates, the name with its name is much and the work with its work is little, particularly in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about this in the introduction to this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For someone who does not understand what we said about anatomy will fall into error, which kills people: as I have seen many of them being formed in this knowledge and boasting about it without understanding, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What happened was that I saw a foolish physician remove a scrophularia boil from a woman's neck, and he cut into some arteries in the neck. Thus, the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor who supposed he would extract a stone from the urine of an old person, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he approached him and extracted the bladder with the stone intact.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed, I had already been summoned to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick person, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another doctor who was receiving a dowry from one of our land's Dukes due to his medical skills: and an affair occurred involving a black eunuch who was with him, suffering from a fracture near the heel: and the doctor acted without knowledge, tightening the fracture over the wound with tongs and nails, using a strong constriction, without allowing the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he completed what was desired by him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he released him after a few days and commanded him not to untie the bandage. And he stood like that until the boil burst on his leg and foot, and he thus came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore summoned to him: and I approached to untie the bandage: and there followed calmness, and he was relieved of his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	But the corruption had already been confirmed in the member: and I could not cure it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption then began to roam around within the member until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who had perforated a cancerous pustule: and it became inflamed for days until the malignancy of him towards his lord was magnified.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This means, that when there is a pure cancer caused by black bile, then it should not be punctured with iron at all, unless it is located on a limb that can tolerate it, in which case the entire thing must be removed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, dear children, you must know that an operation with the hand is divided into two parts. Namely, an operation associated with health and one involving danger in various dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already highlighted throughout this book wherever an operation occurs that involves fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, you must guard against this and dismiss it: so that fools do not find a way to speak and disgrace themselves.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take care with your diligence and protection, and treat your patients with ease and strength, using the better path to heal them through God's grace for health and a commendable succession. And dismiss terrible illnesses that are hard to cure. And remove your souls from what makes you fear, so that hesitation in faith and convenience does not come upon you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is indeed more lasting for your glory and more elevated in this world, and finally for your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen had indeed said this in some of his own instructions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat the bad illness: do not call yourself the doctor of evil.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now we have divided this Treatise into three parts.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On the cautery with fire, and on the cautery with sharp medicine, a chapter organized from head to feet, and about the forms of instruments, and tools of the cautery: and everything that is necessary for an operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On division and puncturing, phlebotomy and ventosis, and wounds: and the removal of arrows, and similar objects: and everything else organized under this heading in terms of the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration and dislocation, and treatment of twists, and similar conditions: organized from head to feet in terms of the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory be to God alone.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the Healing and Harmfulness of the Cautery: which types it is appropriate for, and at what time, and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Head I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we recall the operation with it, it is necessary to say about the quality of its healing and harmful effects, and how they are exhibited in what type.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say then that the discussion about the quality of healing by the cautery and its harm is a lengthy and subtle topic, requiring knowledge and hidden secrets.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise people have spoken on this topic and they have had differing views. As for me, I am content with little from their discussions to avoid unnecessary lengthening of the text.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say that the cautery applies universally to all compositions, whether with material or without material substance, except for two compositions. These are a hot composition without material substance and a dry composition without material substance.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In terms of composition, when hot and dry substances opposed matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that the cauterizing tool is beneficial in such cases.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	Others have said the opposite, namely that the cauterizing tool is not suitable in dryness which results from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is heat, and it would be counterproductive to heal from a condition caused by heat and dryness with heat and dryness itself.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that one said: that the application of the cauterizing tool provides relief in every dryness caused by heat which happens within human bodies. For when you compare a human body and its humidity to the composition of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And indeed, I would say through his speech: because I have often discovered that by experience.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not necessary for someone to apply the cauterizing tool on this unless they have already been proven and trained in the last chapter of the Cauterization procedure. They should be aware of the diversity of human compositions, the nature of illnesses within themselves, their causes, occurrences, duration times, etc.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	As for the other compositions, there is no fear towards you and especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	Indeed, all the doctors have agreed on these matters and there is no disagreement about their benefit when using the cauterizing tool with them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know my children that from the secret of healing through the cauterizing tool with fire and its goodness compared to a burning medicine is: for fire is simple, whose action reaches only to the member being cauterized, and it does not harm another member connected to it, unless in a minor injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The effect of medicine that heals by burning arrives at what extends from the limbs: and perhaps it causes an illness of difficulty in healing to occur within the member, and perhaps it can be fatal.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, because of the subtlety and goodness of its nature, fire does not do this unless there is excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now we have learned this through experience, due to the length of service and study with art, and position above truth in matters, and due to that excuse from the length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if there were not, since it is not allowed to this book of mine, I would reveal to you a secret and hidden thing in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodily expulsions, which he uses to get rid of illnesses using philosophical demonstrative speech that could awaken your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And children, know that they disagree during the time when it is appropriate for a cauterization to happen and put off to better times of truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that a cauterization is appropriate at all times: therefore, harm caused by time is submerged in healing which is drawn towards the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if a cauterization is for pains due to necessary, strong, urgent ones which do not tolerate delay: therefore because of fear that something worse, which is more harmful than the small harm caused by time, might happen from them.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let this thought take root in your minds, children, that they do not consider unless the common and foolish doctors say so: namely, that sicknesses which are being healed by cauterization always return. And they put forth this following consequence, making things seem as if they were not what people think: for a cauterization is only used when medicine fails, which alters complexion and dries out the moisture that causes pains.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the cautery is useful over medicine due to the swiftness of his health and the effectiveness of his treatment, and the intensity of his control: it may happen that a period of weakness returns for some time according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and its effectiveness; and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of excesses within him: and whatever arrives at him in acquisition through food, and similar things through causes, unless sickness occurs where the cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	Subtle sickness in a part of few excesses and moisture, like the cautery for teeth due to pain, and similar things for him, it is possible that this pain does not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the discussion goes further, stating that cautery is the last of medicines, which is a correct statement: not about what they aim for in it; because they believe that there is no cure that comes with medicine, nor after the opportunity of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, this is contrary to that and the intention; that cautery is the last of medicines is not true, unless when we administered methods of treatment in any illness, and those medicines did not bring relief. Then, we administer the cautery at the end of things, and it does bring relief: then it follows that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	Ancient people said that the cautery with gold is better than the one made of iron. And they did not say this just because of the equality of gold and the quality of its substance but also because it doesn't create pus at the site of the cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, this is not absolutely true: because I have already tried it and found that it doesn't do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cautery with it is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat the cautery in fire made from gold, it is not revealed to you how much heat according to your wish it needs due to the color of the gold: and as it approaches the coldness, and if you add heat above it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls into employment from this: and because of this, we use a cautery with iron rather than gold, it is faster and closer to accuracy in operations.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed, I have arranged this Chapter on the cautery according to its sections, and organized it from head to foot so that anyone seeking something can find what they want.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Chapter 1: On the method of applying a cautery to the forehead.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This application of the cautery involves balancing moisture and coldness on the brain: these are the two causes that lead to excessive discharge of bodily fluids from the head to the eye and ear areas, as well as many other symptoms like dreams, tooth pain, throat pain, and all sorts of illnesses resulting from coldness such as paralysis, sodae (a type of epilepsy), epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cautery application is to treat the sick: initially, cleanse their head with a purifying solution for three nights or four, according to what the strength of the patient requires, and their age, and their habits.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to wash his head with new water.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands in a square position, so that his hands are already on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Therefore, whenever your middle finger goes into it, mark that place with an unburned brand.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply oil to the cauterizer: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with an unburned brand, applying pressure, gradually tighten your hand and then rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand and you will see the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already exposed from the bone, a quantity of alkali's head, or a quantity of zew herb, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, apply your hand with the iron itself, or use another that has been cooled down until you see the bones as I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, then apply it to the affected area, and place it over the spot: and remove it after three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked buttered substance over it, and remove it when the scab is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat that with the fourfold ointment until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more of the wound remains open, pus is emitted from it; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and hold the cautery until some thickness of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is sutured after that which has been prepared from the bone, and then treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it should be done with the cautery until one reaches the end, until an imprint of a tooth is made in the mouth, so that the mouth falls as if it were a form of a kirate: or an instrument that women place infused in miniature alphabet: and they think that vapors from the head escape from this point, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is cured until it has hardened.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, these two kinds of cautery are not entirely distinguishable except in some people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to let it heal itself, for me it is better with the health of oneself.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	Indeed, the head weakens from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified with other body parts, and especially when the head is naturally weak: and indeed the first kind of cautery seems to be more beneficial and better for me, and I rely on that method, therefore acting upon it with regard to health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Section 1: On the manner of applying cautery to the head when suffering from pain throughout the head.
Caput III.	Head Chapter III
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic headache occurs throughout the head: and if this lasts in an afflicted individual, they make use of herbs, baths, purgatives, oils, and enemas.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been treated with one cautery, as we have described, and nothing from that applies to him; then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is of strong natural creation and is not weak, and finds a sudden coldness: then apply cautery with another cautery underneath to that point slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then apply cautery over all the horns of their head with a cautery, so that it does not pass through the skin, and uncover the quantity from the bone as we described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And he cauterizes himself with a single cautery at the top of his head, at the place called the peak. This is the spot where suction is placed and your hand should be raised above it; you will not touch the mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	Indeed, he found relief from severe pain and a different kind of more intense head pain among all other types.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I shall speak of this as a cautery at its place: it must be a cautery used for cauterizing the horns of the head and the back of his head with a finer cautery that cauterizes the middle part of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	¶ On the method of cauterization for one-sided headaches, both with heated medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur on the head or the pain extends to the eye, and relief is sought with purging medicines for the head, and other treatments are administered as previously described in the divisions of complaints, without encompassing it entirely; then cauterization occurs in this way according to two methods: either by applying a cautery with a burning hot medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	And the cautery with a burning hot medicine is as follows: you take one tooth or similar object, remove its outer layer, and cut off its extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then divide the pain area while using a large bloodletting tool until you create a spot under the skin where the tooth is extracted.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore, insert it into him beneath the skin until it disappears: then tighten it over it with a constriction fitting enough, and let it remain for fifteen hours. Then release it, apply butter to it until pus forms at the spot: afterwards treat it with ointment until it is fully healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to perform this with some physicians who burn like I wrote in the twelfth treatise on those who are medicated with medieval remedies.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	However, the cauterization with iron is according to this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Igneous Cauterization, whose form is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the Claw: because its head's shape resembles that of a claw, where there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the site and hold your hand. And you should move the iron gradually with speed: and the amount to be burned from the thickness of the skin should be like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery below is not burned and there is no flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the wick in salt water and place it over the area, then remove it for three days. Then place the wick with butter; after that take care with ointment until fully healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, perform this partial head cauterization with the second surgical instrument of the cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And be careful not to make an old mistake near the cut area on this partial head.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	### On the method of cauterization for the old partial head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a partial head, follow the treatment that we have discussed from the previous healing process, and consider what was said about divisions of illnesses. Do not compare this treatment to others. Observe the illness itself; if it is insufficient according to the first cauterization with medicine or with cauterization by fire, then you must use the second surgical instrument of cautery until the area turns white after the signs of pain appear as a line whose length is half of a finger, or somewhat like this. Hold your hand in one place, and press it until you touch the artery, and continue until you reach the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you must beware of the continuity of the jaw bone which moves during chewing, lest it scorch the side or the nerve that moves it, thus causing a cramp.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be mindful of the safeguard and precaution against blood flow in the artery which has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	Indeed, there is a fear when it comes to its removal, especially for the one who does not understand what he is doing and lacks diligence as well as experience: and he performs the operation with him initially.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will be lenient with the recall of the regulation of blood flow occurrences from the artery according to its manner, and within the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see the discomfort that does not suffice him with this cautery treatment, and if you see an infirm body enduring the cautery in the middle of its head, as we have told, take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see fit, administer the cautery, as we said in chapter on extracting an artery while holding the cautery with two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	Indeed, this form of cauterization is better and more effective.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	¶ The method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When ear pain occurs due to cold and it is treated with the use of hot substances, and all other treatments as we have mentioned in division, and if the pain does not cease, then use fire for cauterization: this thing that is called 'Punctum' has this form.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then after the ignition of it with him, make punctures around the entire circumference of the ear as it is described: or around both sides if pain occurs in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen thee with the cautery from the root of the ear to some extent after you have marked the places with a heated stick: and let the amount of the cautery be ten points in every ear, and somewhat more.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then take care of those places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	¶ On the method of cauterization during torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture that heals with cauterization is nothing other than the cases which occur from inflammation, as we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the appropriate cauterization for the case that occurs from drying out and muscle spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this kind of torture with bleeding and purges and gargling and if your treatment does not yield results, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the patient three times with the cautery: one at the root of the ear, and the second slightly below its usual position, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the patient's weakness.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For healing does not occur, unless in the part which appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of the cauterization is, to cauterize that part with the cautery directly under the upper end of the external ear up to a bit below the skull bone: and another one at this time; whose length should be according to the length of a thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And keep your hand with the cautery until the area of medium thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it's a type from the knife-like tool, as described before: but it should not be much thinner than what you see. And it needs to have a knife within it that has slightly more thickness than necessary.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the area, until it is healed, following what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	¶ On the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Title VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy hardens, and you treat it with the methods we have discussed, and your treatment does not coincide with it, and the patient does not have a fever, then perform four cauterizations on his entire scalp, and a cauterization in the middle of the head as we said, and a cauterization at the back of the head, according to what has preceded. And the degree of cauterization should be according to what has preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	And also, the stomach is cauterized with a cauterizing agent over its mouth: and this is more toward the end.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it is cured in accordance with what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	¶ On the method of cauterization in Omission.
Caput IX.	Title IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that for the person who drinks in the mouth at first, they give him large doses of laudanum and brain purifying pills.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the patient, and place the described plaster of saffron on his forehead: and apply it periodically.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	Indeed, that is the method of cauterization: and do this according to the same order I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then it is healed through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then do three cauterizations on the posterior part of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between each cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then attention to the cautery, together with what precedes it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you're adding [something] and the sick person is able to endure that: then do the cautery for him in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you're adding [something]: then apply the cautery over both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for him until he is healed: and apply the cautery with oil according to the manner that was previously stated.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Next, shave the sick person's head: afterwards apply the cautery on the middle of the head, and apply it over all the horns of the head, and apply it over the back part of his head, and three times over the cervical vertebrae.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you're lacking in bodily softening for many of these [conditions], and the sick person is able to endure it, and the illness is strong: then apply the cautery four times over the cervical vertebrae, and the last one with a cautery until much of his skin burns, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him until he is healed: and apply the cautery with oil in this manner.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, you must cleanse his brain first when you have an itch, and with the rest of the treatments we mentioned in the division: when the sick person is great, or is able to endure the intake of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If it is a child who cannot bear medicines, then gargling and brain-enlivening mastications are administered, prior to many days with the improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then cut his head, afterwards cauterize him with a cautery at the center of the head, according to what has been stated beforehand. And use another cautery on the back of his neck and apply a cauterization over all parts of his skull.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	And if he is sick yet strong, and tolerates treatments well, then cauterize him with the cauterizing instruments I described for paralysis, and apply softening to his cervical vertebrae and vertebral column. And use an olive oil-coated cautery as was instructed beforehand.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	If it is instead the case that he is sick and it is a child, then place a fine cautery according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	### Method for Cauterization in Melancholy.
Caput XII.	Head Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then use cauterizing instruments as we have described for someone with paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is excess descending towards melancholy and makes the body overly moist, then give him a drink that enlivens his brain as was described previously in division. Then cut the head of the sick person, and make a centrally formed tourniquet from linen like a circle afterwards.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place her in the middle of the head, and let the sick person sit with his back straight from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is preferable to be made from old bee wax.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat him with the warmth of the fire that can be tolerated by his finger when it is being introduced into him.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate him in the middle of his head in a circle, and release him until he cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this for the sick person once every week, while maintaining their good routine, until they recover.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if it's an eye, cauterize him by making many small punctures, and when you hold the cautery you should smell its scent.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this reason, the appearance of the cautery moistens the brain with quality.

Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When you are told the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I mentioned in division, then begin to treat the sick person with whatever will purify his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all humidity, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize himself in the middle of his own head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then, if the beginning of water is simultaneous in both eyes, cauterize him twice on each eye with two cauterizations: or from one side if it's only one eye. Remove all veins and arteries under the skin, making sure the cauterization spans long width across the areas, taking care to avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, remove it immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I perform the incisions with wisdom, which is in the extraction of veins and removal of them, and caution against bleeding.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, between two bones, with two final applications of the cautery.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are old and constant: they are on the veins and arteries which are manifestly situated outside the head. It is understood that this comes from excesses of coldness and phlegm. Then, cauterize with a cauterizing method as I described in the beginning of the descent of water, i.e., cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations at two intervals, and two cauterizations in the neck below two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you lack additional treatment, then cauterize it completely around the edge of the eye with a small cautery on the end of the eyebrow.

When you are treating this, according to what we have said about its division, and if the treatment does not match: then hasten, and give him three nights of an infusion made from a decoction of bitter onions. Then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cauterizer, using an oily one as well.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a pinch-bone cauterizer twice, above two eyebrows under the hair slightly.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And watch out for the artery, do not hit it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	This is the form of the Clavli cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Regarding the method of cauterization for softening of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye softens due to illness or moisture, then use one cauterizing iron with this lunar cauterizing iron.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if it's a case of an eye, apply ironing over the two upper eyebrows with slightly more than two ironings in every part: and let these last for two periods: and make the length of all the ironings according to the lengths of the eyebrows: do not use your hands directly with the ironing tool, but instead follow the quantity that burns the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	This is the form of the cauterizing iron according to this lunar cauterization method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when the hair is turned and stings the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterizing iron is according to two methods: either the cauterizing iron with fire: or the cauterizing iron with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cauterizing iron with fire, you should instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if there are any among them that cleanse him, until they extend and align.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they sting him near his dawn (referring to the time when the cauterization is performed): then bind his eyes with a towel so that they don't move until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and have aligned themselves, then place the patient's head on your bosom: next mark his eyelids with an iron, a mark that should resemble the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the start of the mark be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place the wick soaked in egg white: or on the eye with psyllium mucus.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Next apply the fire from the cauterizing iron, which is as follows in shape.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then apply cautery to the figure, which you marked gradually on many subjects until the surface of the skin is burned, which appears like the shape of a leaf of myrtle.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of health for your work is: if you notice that the eyelid has already contracted and the hairs lifted above the eye incision.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So raise your hand then: and let it go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place butter with Cotum over it until the scab is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	And if any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid softens: then reapply cautery to that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	And if the hairs are in the lower part: then apply cautery to it until they rise to their natural place; and adjust them so that they do not irritate the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	¶ Concerning the method of applying cautery with burning medicine in this situation.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	Just as you would instruct the sick person to remove hairs until they extend and align.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from a piece of linen the shape of a leaf of myrtle.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap and from the ash of unsoaked dung one ounce each or roughly this much. Next grind these together finely with a good mortar, making sure not to cool them.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread some of it over the piece of paper you made like the shape of a leaf of myrtle, and place this over one or both eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye butter that has been soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick person lie on your chest.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger upon the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you move your finger as often as you feel the medicine bite: for he has found its bite, like a fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	So when he persists with that bite which he himself has found, then you release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	And when the bite stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then observe, if you see the eyelid lift up, as it does with contraction from heat or incision, this is well: and if not, then apply again over it with medicine to the place where the medicine does not adhere, until your operation is equalized and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put on it Cuth (a type of wool or cloth) with butter until the burned skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then attend to it with the clarifying balm or another suitable substance, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And for your operation, you must observe the final care to ensure nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after a day and some hair fights within the eye, then apply medicine to that place which is softening from the eyelid itself, as you did initially.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then attend to it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the leaf of the myrtle.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you will know that men's eyes vary in size and clarity.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, there should be this consideration for you: and do not hide the way of the straight path to him who has a desire to learn this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterization in a weeping fistula.
Caput XIX.	Title XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you are treating a Fistula, if your treatment according to what we have discussed about alleviating ailments does not yield the desired results, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in accordance with this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the patient to place his head on your chest, and have him hold his head with his attendant's hands like this: so that it does not move or shift with his own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the infused Catu (a type of paste) onto his eyelid or over the mucus of eggs: then take the cautering instrument with this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Sit in a bowl like the shape of a goose feather quill from one end to another, as is done for the cautering instrument: and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other end, or if you wish it to go upwards, try this.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this bowl is better suited for your task.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the Fistula, if it is open, and extract its pus, then cleanse it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract its contents (pus).
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautering instrument on it, which is made to burn greatly.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand close to the cautering instrument at the eye, up to the nostril area, so that your hand does not stray or disturb the patient, and place the cautering instrument into the fatty part of the eye, and burn it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If you reach at the beginning to the tip of your cautering instrument up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then use the cautering instrument once, or twice if you need it, and let that pass for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place Catgut with butter, and take care of it with drying ointment until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply over it a sharp corrosive medicine until the mouth is revealed. And cut it according to how it has grown in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another mode of cautery for a fistula, which some have said was first mentioned.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Proceed to the site of the fistula and close it. Then place a fine camel's wool (or tube) into the opening, that is, a thin cannula whose form is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the weight of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with the good retaining cannula, so that the patient does not move at all, lest it flow or the melted lead come to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you must place catgut that has been immersed in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, along with what we have described from cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a hole in the nose and bring the fistula back to the course of the nose according to how it will be suitable for itself in its own place.

Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times there occur wounds in the lips called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	So when you care for these wounds, with what we have said about the division of ailments, and if there is no treatment, then use a small surgical knife to cauterize with fire according to this shape.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its curvature be according to the fineness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it, while it is alight, quickly within the cracks, until the cauterizing agent reaches the depth of the cracks.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Next, take care of it with the ointment until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Section on the method of cauterization for a fistula in the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Title XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of a gum or on the palate or roots of teeth: pus is formed and bursts out; afterwards it becomes inflamed and pus runs, forming a fistula. Then take care of that area without imposing too much treatment there. At this point, use fire to cauterize according to what quantity it fills in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Next, insert the burning object into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches the depth and end of it. Do this either once or in two stages.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then take care of it afterward, according to what we said about care until it heals.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If it is removed when it's healthy and it heals, that will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it will be necessary to uncover the place and remove the infected bone according to what comes out at its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Section on the method of cauterization for softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	Title XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum becomes softened due to moisture and teeth become loose, take care of it with medicines without imposing too much treatment. Then place the head of the sick person in your armpit.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the fire cauterization, whose form will emerge after this, so that you place a cannula on the tooth: and insert the ignited cauterizing instrument into it quickly; and hold your hand for a moment until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand: then apply the cautery several times, according to what you like.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the sick person should fill their mouth with salty water and hold it for an hour: and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth becomes stronger due to motion, and the gums become softened and tightened, and dried up any dampness that has gone bad.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Regarding the method of applying cautery in dental pain.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness within it, or a worm, and medical treatment does not alleviate the condition: then apply the cautery inside according to two methods: either with butter and cautery: or with oil and cautery.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The method of applying the cautery with butter is such that you take the solidified butter and apply it to the bulla, within a ferric earthenware pot or within a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a thread and wrap it around the tip of the tongue.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in heated butter and place it gently over the painful tooth, hold it until the heat of the flame reaches the root of the tooth; then repeat this several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the teeth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you like, immerse wool or a thread into cold butter and place it over the painful tooth. And put an ignited iron over it until the heat reaches deep within the tooth cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	The cautery method with fire is to aim for an air tube or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And there should be some thickness within the body of the instrument so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the fire cautery, which takes the form of a tool. Place it upon that tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for pain is relieved, either on the same day or on another.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it should be that the patient fills their mouth with the good substance of the application of this cautery, holds it for an hour and then spits it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	This is how the cautery should be applied.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Apply the cautery with any extremity as is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.

Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Strophuli are affected by phlegm and cold moisture and do not respond to medication or speed up their digestion with remedies; then apply a concave fire cautery of this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that the smoke leaves at one end of the cautery from the other end: place it ignited over a blister once and if you need to do it again twice, until it reaches the depth of the blister.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the blister is small: then apply the cautery according to the size of the blisters.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then release it for three days, and place over it an infusion mixed with butter until what was burned by the fire is relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with the salve of teeth until the form of the cannula is healed.

Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moist substances lie over the pulmonary canal, especially when it concerns a constitution characterized by coldness, then the sick person should be relieved of medicines first.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then apply cautery to him at no time near the root of the throat at a depressed location: and be careful not to extend with the cauterizer to the throat or skin, except for some part of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then apply the cauterizer to him at another location on the neck, at the end of his cervical vertebrae while finishing it. And let the cauterizer be like a second one that preceded this method.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then continue to care for him with what has preceded until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	¶ Concerning the method of applying cautery in pulmonary disorders and coughing.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When coughing and lung discomfort are due to cold moisture, and the patient does not have fever or tuberculosis, nor is this discomfort new: then apply two applications of cautery above the gullet at depressed areas, gently, and thoroughly.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And apply another cauterizer in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cauterizer be like the one that has preceded in shape.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish for a cautery puncturing with the cauterizer which is called Punctum, whose shape has preceded in ear pain puncture: and let there be punctures from thirty points up to almost as far as others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then continue to care for him with what has preceded until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let there be a cauterizer having three branches: according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Where the cautery is applied with it, when you do it instead of one threefold cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Regarding the method of applying the cautery for setting the elbow in dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Head 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to dampness and does not settle at the time of his return from its dislocation until that becomes a habit for him, then when it gets dislocated by a slight movement, as we have already testified to you, such as this, then it is necessary that you should reduce the dislocation in the first place.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is made to lie down on his back, or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Next, lift the skin which is inside the elbow on top of your left hand with fingers touching the upper part: and if the dislocation concerns the inner side.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, holding the cautery lit for two truly.
Cuius forma est haec.	The form of which is as follows.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Next, apply the cautery to the skin until it penetrates through to the other side, and you will obtain the figure of the cautery with four applications.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cautery is applied with a tool having three parts, for which reason then the figure of the cautery results into six more. And there are parts according to the subtlety of the probe.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	This is the form of the tool that has three parts for applying the cautery.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one adds this method above this manner, which makes eight cauterizations in total.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place over the cautery bits of ground herbs mixed with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then ensure the patient remains at rest, so that they do not move any part of their body while this continues, until they are comforted.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, and it rarely occurs like this, then you should burn him above the shoulder with an incising blade or by burning him multiple times in various spots.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	And the joint becomes stable and the moisture is removed; and the sick person gets healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	¶ On the method of burning the Stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and multiple dampness occur in the Stomach until it is removed from its composition, and continuous coughs are directed to it, and intensive methods of treatment do not yield results: then it becomes necessary for the sick person to be laid on his back, and extend his legs, and raise his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then apply the treatment with three burnings; using one unit digit-sized incising blade for the cauterization under the earlobe of the chest, and using an incising blade like a key for the central area. And perform two more burnings below from both sides of the single-blade incision until the figure of the deeper burn appears in a triangular shape.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch it between the two so that they do not join together when pus is being produced.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the burn be as thick as two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the deeper burn be as follows without addition: and if you wish to apply a large incising blade in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let this incision be made by a cauterizing tool according to the figure of a circle according to this shape.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is burned by making a mark with this burning tool: and it should be like marks on the stomach that match the size you desire when using a hot tool: then burn him with a puncturing tool: then treat him with the treatment that preceded until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the method of applying cautery To an icy cold subject.
Caput XXIX.	Head 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When a pain occurs in the neck due to coldness and moisture, or from dense winds, until he leaves his natural composition of excess discharge, and the patient is treated as we said, but does not benefit in that case: then it should be applied to the sick person over his neck, and three applications of cauterization according to this figure, and the same quantity below the abdomen where a man's arm arrives: and there should be space between each application of cauterization according to the thickness of your finger: and let there be a straight cauterization according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cauterizer for too long.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let there be the quantity that burns from the thickness of the skin, the medium quantity not added: and let the patient stand on his own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however he is not standing, then lie down, who now extends his legs and has raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible for you to apply these cauterizations with a surgical instrument when you have skill and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And protect yourself so that you do not proceed too far in cauterization and burn the thickness of the skin throughout, causing the entire body to be burned, and it reaches the intestines: for there is thinness there, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of applying cautery to the neck region.
Caput XXX.	Head 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When there is an eruption, and you need to know if that pustule is within the skin of the neck or on its clothes: then, if it is in the skin of the neck, the patient experiences pain and heaviness without sharpness. And if it's on the clothes of the neck, there is a sudden sharp pain with the pain. You will now see that their treatment has already tired out their doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary that the patient should support themselves on their neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then draw the position for applying the hot needle: then use the cautery, which is likened to a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is how it should be done.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And while doing this, apply one cautery until the whole skin is burned out, and go up to the siphon, until all pus comes out. Then care for the healing of the exits, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary for me to use this type of cautery, except for someone whose study in the art of medicine has been prolonged: and for whom illnesses come with experience often enough. Then he may dare upon such operations.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But rather to dispense with it, as far as I am concerned, is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Section: On the method of cauterization for pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Title XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that for cold pleurisy, the cautery should be used with the roots of the plant Aristolochia in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is such that you take a long root from the dry roots of Aristolochia, one longer root which can be found there, and it should be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and then ignite it with fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then apply a single cautery where there is the connection between the breastbone and the neck, and with two smaller cauterizations somewhat declining to the lower part, towards the area under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauterizations in the area between the fifth and sixth ribs, downwards slightly: and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three incisions for the burners: one where there are between two spoons: and two incisions for both sides of the chest, lower burner which is between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the burner, rather there should be a clear smell of skin when it is burning.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some of the old ones have said that there are people who use a burner made from iron similar to a compass. They ignite it and then insert it inside where is between the ribs, until they reach with it to the pustule, and come out healed: just as we explained in the case of the Epa's pustules.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But with this incision using the burner there is a concern that either the patient will die immediately, or a窦 opens up at the site, which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	¶ On the method of burning the spleen Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat spleen illness, as we discussed from the treatment of illnesses divided by time, and if your cure does not succeed, then for burning there are three methods for it, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is to make three or four burns, laid out in a row according to the length of the spleen, like the figure of Epa's burners that preceded it.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each burn the width of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the intensity of the burn, as we said about the burn at Epa's place, be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the burner: and let the patient be in a raised position on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method for burning is: having two actual burners as we explained in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder blade. And lift the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches to. And make your lifting action for lifting skin according to the width of the body, so that the burns fall longitudinally according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two heated needles until you penetrate the skin from the other side; then remove the cautery: thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three needles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then after you let the cautery out for it to emit pus for many days, as it is more purifying than all that went before from the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Section: On the method of cauterization in Hydrocele.
Caput XXXIII.	Title XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall into hydrocele unless it is properly asclitic.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydrocele with the methods of treatment we have discussed in division, and if the treatment does not sufficiently heal, then it is necessary to apply four cauterizations around the umbilicus, a single cautery over the stomach, another over the epar, one over the spleen, and two cauterizations behind along the vertebras, and one directly on the breast, and another directly on the stomach. And let the depth of the cauterization be about as thick as the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then let the open cautery emit pus over a prolonged period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not discharge the invalid from treatment after cauterization with him: it is necessary that two intentions should unite in this: and he will hasten towards his own healing with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be a crescent: according to its previous shape. And the one used for cauterizing the back should be an oval, according to its previous shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Section: On the method of cauterization for Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Title XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When blisters appear due to dropsy and they become filled with yellowish water: you must cauterize on the top of the foot at the point known as 'nocrati', which is situated between the auricular part and the annular part. Then raise your hand with the cauterizer, do not twist it. Next, raise your hand again, don't go too far with it entirely.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	Indeed, the yellow water will reappear, and perform the cauterization according to this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then, make two cauterizations on each of the two legs across the entire leg, and perform a cauterization at the tip of the knife-shaped cauterizer. Perform a cauterization according to the length of the leg, one under the knee and the other somewhat lower, roughly midway down the leg. Then do two cauterizations over every hip joint: and allow the open cauterizer to heal without prolonged care until some water is able to resurface from it: then take care of it along with what we have said previously.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Regarding the method of cauterization in the solution of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Title XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the belly becomes dissolved due to cold and moisture until it weakens the retained and digesting strengths which are in the stomach and intestines: then heal this according to the methods of healing, and do not cure. You will see a weakened being able to tolerate the cauterization of excessive strength, then cauterize him with a large cauterizer on his stomach as he did when cauterizing the stomach with a circular cauterizer, and four small cauterizations around the navel with a narrow triangular cauterizer: then perform a large cauterization over the inguinal region above the pubis, or use two cauterizers.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and a weakened person tolerating this, then cauterize him with a cauterizer on the ribcage, and another on every part of his body. And perhaps you might add two small cauterizations near the large stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For indeed, the treatment is successful, which help does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	¶ On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Head 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are caused by thick, cold, or damp humors that persist even after treatment as described in division [referring to a previous section], and if the usual cure does not work: then cauterize with three applications of cautery over the lower part of the vertebral spine beneath the navel, in an area roughly shaped like a triangle. Apply the cautery under the navel as if it were two fingers wide.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you consider that their stomach is cooled down and their food does not digest properly, and if you see their face reddening due to this condition, then cauterize them with a large cautery over the stomach according to what precedes: and apply it on its Epar [a term possibly referring to a specific organ or region], and use another application on its Splen (possibly referring to a type of organ) using an iron-shaped cautery. Allow the open cautery to rest at some point in time, then continue tending to them until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	¶ On the method of cauterizing adenoids after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Head 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove the adenoids, then use a cautery that resembles a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited one into the removed adenoids: and hold your hand until the cautery reaches the vein's opening from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the adenoids are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them as you apply the means that are agreeable to the ointments until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cauterizer on bone wax, it is more beneficial for healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not respond to the section and operation that we have described in its appropriate place, and is frightened by it, perhaps healing occurs with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	And when an Anal Fistula occurs and sets in, pus flows from it, and corrupted moisture escapes.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, what is more suitable is to probe it with a delicate instrument.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then, determine the depth of its depth using a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cauterizer that resembles a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then, insert yourself, lit up, into the Anal Fistula and determine the depth to which the probe has gone.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And apply the cauterizer repeatedly to that area until all corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need's amount.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And protect yourself from the irritation of the nerve, if there is one there or in a large vein. Or if the Fistula drains to the Bladder Body, or to the Intestine Body, then protect yourself from all these areas.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform that, unless when the Fistula is in a fleshy area: and you think, because it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then attend to the area until it has been healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If the area is sealed and materials are removed from it, and there remains such a long time: then you will know that he has been healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not remove from it any substance, then you will know that there is a penetrating thing, or the mouth of him is corrupted deeply within, or as one of these comes from among them: and this reminiscence will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	How to perform cautery on the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Title Thirty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys due to coldness or from thick winds and it is diminished by this, then you must apply cautery over the umbilicus on their own kidneys, with a cylindrical cautery on the entire kidney, following which there will be a reminiscence.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we apply cautery again within its abdominal cavity.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore, three lines will be present.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they are more effective in healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	How to perform cautery on the bladder.
Caput XL.	Title Forty.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and dullness occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture until the patient no longer retains urine, then you should apply cautery on the lower part of the suminis over the bladder where hair begins. Start from the right side of suminis and from the left side of this: let the length of that cautery be equal to the width of a finger's breadth. And apply cautery in the inferior part of the back, or with two applications of cautery if you need it: and let its width be as described by the previous cautery using the thumb. And apply cautery again at the inferior edge or with two applications if necessary: and make it as described by a cylindrical cautery beforehand.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	How to perform cautery on the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Title Forty-One.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When there is coldness and moisture in the womb, which prevents pregnancy from occurring and corrupts her periods, causing delay in their occurrence, and when she experiences pain during their arrival, then it is necessary to apply three cauterizations around the umbilicus, as we have said about cauterization of the bladder, and a cylindrical cautery on the lower abdomen. Let this be a cylindrical cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the thumb in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Title XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the moist substances spread towards the base of the thumb and cause its departure from its place: and the sign of this is that when they are compared against each other, the crus extends over the other one. And the location of the dislocation is found to be in it as a vacuum.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, you must cauterize the tender spot above the base of the thumb with a similar circular cautery. After marking it with an iron around the area of the base, as it rotates; and let the tip of the base fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the shape of the cautery precede in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, using a large oil-filled cautery. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterization for Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Title XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the base of the thumb and it is caused by cold and moisture; and if the sick person remains with this as we said in division, and there is no cure, and it persists: then you must relieve the sick from the thick fluids with stinking pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization for this is according to two methods: either a cautery with aromatic medicines or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cautery with fire, according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One method is, to cauterize over the point of the hook using three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them have a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space that exists between each and every cautery, equal to the thickness of a finger's width: make it an oil-coated cautery.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	However, sometimes the cautery is made in the middle over the tip of the hook itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes the cauterization of the dislocation of the hook, do it once: so that there be a circle containing the entire hook.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn through the thickness of all the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization for Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hook itself and does not extend down to the thigh and calf.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends down to the thigh and calf, then cauterize him with two cauteries over the thigh, over the place where the patient is bent there, wherever pain exists, and your cautery on the nodule of four fingers slightly downwards: let it be a surgical knife cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	And if the patient bends that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize him there where he bent with a point cautery, three times, or four times, or as many times as it needs for him.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he bends the pain to be below the knee towards the calf, then cauterize him there with a single surgical knife cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And remember in all your applications of cautery that you do not burn with the cautery to the point of damaging nerves or great arteries, and thereby inflict harm upon the sickly either through scarring or constriction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have seen one and another from those who burned above the stone, and ended in their application of cautery. The leg swelled until a tumor formed below it, and the entire foot was punctured and then rotted away. Afterwards there is a rupture of the abdomen, and death follows that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain occurs in both parts simultaneously, apply cautery to both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said about the application of cautery to the ankle, regarding this method of cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar one from iron, whose diameter is half of a palm: and have it at its opening according to the thickness of the core of a finger, or slightly less precisely. And within this iron piece, place a third piece of iron inside.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space between each piece of iron be by the size of a joint of a thumb: and have all pieces of iron open from both parts. And let their height be like a knot, or two knots. And make handles for them out of iron that are centrally fitting in relation to the pieces of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then heat it over the fire until it turns red and expels sparks. Then place it on a poultice over the ankle of the sick person lying down on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	So apply three round applications of cautery to it once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him rest for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then dress the wound with butter, and leave the open wound to heal over many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care it together with the ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis said, regarding this form of cauterization or its offspring, we have not used it much due to the fear of its appearance: therefore, because we find few who wait for it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is from among the good cauterizations that he who endures it, and finds its place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterization with those who endure medicines is such that you make two samia (a type of reed used for medical purposes) with a perforated bracelet through which the hinge of his door descends from the air or iron, having the same length as the walls: their heights have two knots, or rather they themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between the two be as much as the width of a finger, and let them be open at the bottom and top: and they should contain themselves to each other according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it over the sand bath, with the sick person lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand onto the sand bath of the anchor many times.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles made from hot water, which has been heated with a fire for a while, and keep it for the amount of time that makes up an hour: and the sick person will endure his biting and the heating of it himself, as he finds out the biting like a flame, until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the tool and wipe off the hot water from the anchor entirely with sweet water: then let that be done for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on it until the heated blackness is removed: and let that be for several days, and pus comes out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the last thing in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make him lie on that which contains water as you did before when the wound was of equal length.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method for using warm water: and I have already written about it in my treatise on correcting medical practices.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alum and ashes that have not been completely burnt together, split one part of them. Rub both parts thoroughly, put them into a new jar whose bottom is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity it can contain, its radius: and place another treated jar under the base of the jar; let the water mix with the alum and ashes come out on top of them that submerges each by an inch: after which you compress them with your hand in good compression: and pour off the jar until the sharper water comes out from the bottom part of the treated jar.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over another ashes: and heat it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	Indeed, it will then be very sharp and corrosive, which is administered in many medical operations, and for cauterizing other body parts.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medical preparations used for cauterization of ointments, just like with resins and cardon fruit, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And indeed, Galen recounted in his writings about a man from the old times who was treated for pain and vein inflammation of the sciatic nerve, and he praised the effect greatly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because no other treatment is necessary, and because he was cured by the use of one thing, until he returned, because perhaps he went into the bath that had been prepared, and came out from it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it must be taken from the root of the green herb: and if green is not found, take the dry, fresh one: and much should be ground with a little fat, and put over where there is pain, or on the leg, or in the thigh: and it should be tied up, and removed after three hours, or to whatever degree the patient feels the heat of the application.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then immerse him in the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	And when his body becomes moist, immerse him in the stool.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain goes away and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that no one should use any cautery with these remedies unless after the body's evacuation.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And as Dioscorides said, that the dung of goats, when used with cautery on a sciatic vein, cools it down: and the cautery is done according to this manner.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Wool is taken and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep spot which is between the big toe and the instep, being closer to the instep.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry dung of goats and ignite him in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	And then put the charred dung over the wool, and remove it when it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this procedure.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not stop doing that until the sensation reaches up to the ankle through the application, and then let the pain rest.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	This method of cauterization is named the Vaccinal Cauterizm.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On the treatment of back pain through cautery.
Caput XLIIII.	Title 42.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back for various reasons, either due to chance, impact, over-excretion, or similar conditions, resulting from the infusion of cold and moist substances. Indeed, cautery does not fall except in this single species alone, which results from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuating the patient with stinking pills and similar remedies, they should be applied where there is pain on the back. Three lines are made according to the width of half a finger in that place. After that, the marks are made with an iron stick in every line for five times, or more depending on the quantity that comes out from the patient's tolerance, and this action is performed while applying cautery points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if it is necessary, apply the cautery three times, or four, using a median claw-like cautery according to this shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of applying cautery for an early gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Title 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This affliction occurs frequently among young, full-term infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: a constriction that occurs during his intake and movement when he is breathing heavily on him. You find at the last cervical vertebra and nodes of it, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	And when you see this and wish to do it, then apply the cautery with a circular cautery according to this shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery be applied evenly over all parts to the spondylus. If you intend to cauterize around the spondylus with a point of the cautery, then two or three lines, and make points close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the wound until it heals together with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, do not apply the cautery to the hump that forms due to nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	In regards to the manner of cauterization for gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When joint pains are caused by cold moisture spreading to any part of the body, and when pains occur in the feet, according to the customs of physicians, they would name this condition properly as gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	So when the treatment for cold-caused gout does not alleviate the pains despite following cure methods, then they apply the cautery to remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you should apply the cautery around the area of the foot after bowel evacuation, using multiple applications of the cautery: and use oil-based cautery.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is how it is done.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the face of the foot, then do so with a point from the cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains rise to the knees or other joints and often happen like this, then apply the cautery evenly over all parts of each knee with three or four applications, using the same method as for treatment with a knife (Clauili).
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If however you need more of this cautery, then apply it again.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand in the cautery, rather let its application be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If pains then rise up to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in his own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If pains are only in the hands, then make incisions around the wrist area, as they say two lines should be drawn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, there remains from the pains in the fingers, then prick them, over every joint point, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If pains rise up after days to the elbows or shoulders, then apply the cautery to each from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not let the sick person be relieved by good management, by the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good treatment is done, and phlegm is expelled, it will be cured with the help of God using this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	¶ On the method of applying the cautery in Wounds.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines or spermatic cord descends to the testicle, and this starts close by: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to relieve themselves on their usual day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And use those remedies which cause the feces to come down from their own belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and command him to hold his breath until he exhales, or until the spermatic cord or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then guide him back with your fingers, and apply the mark with the cautery under the rupture on the palm of his hand, using a mark that resembles half the diameter of a circle at the top part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the cautery fire, which has this form, until white comes out and urine flows.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then return the intestine or the sponge to its own concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand on the spot so that the intestine does not escape: and you have now opened between the thighs of the sick person, and placed a pillow underneath, and someone else is serving above his thighs, and another one above his chest who holds the hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on him at the mark, with your hand holding the cautery straight above it.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you follow his mouth with it: or turn him alternately on other sides if you have not followed him from the first up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cautery, so as not to burn it, and may it not escape over the sick person causing death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not follow with your cautery during the operation, your action is incomplete.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it must be that the children's cautery is subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the remaining ointments until they have healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to provide for his sustenance during the time of his healing in a way that soothes his stomach: so as not to allow the intestine to escape at the point and after eating.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a ligature made centrally and let him be held by others for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should be eased from labor, overeating of food and drink, and loud cries or exclamations.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is used, then complete healing occurs.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will say that the treatment of wounds with cutting in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however wounds happen in the rest of the body, and are beginning, and one wishes not to allow them to add, then burn the wound with a round cauterizing tool according to its quantity: and let that which is burned be from then on like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it, with what we said: and do not let it increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some of the first said: that the wound should be burned with a triangular cauterizing tool, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with a hot iron, and a line is made which is across the width at the upper side of the wound, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the triangular cauterizing tool.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cauterizing is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	§ On the method of cauterization for pains due to case or impact.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens in certain limbs due to an accident or impact, and that pain persists for a long time without receiving treatment from the physicians: then it must be burned with a punctum cauterizing tool.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cauterizing for any limb should be according to its size, shape, weakness and strength of that limb, as well as the position of twisting, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cauterizing, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then apply another cauterization on top of it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because regarding these pains, they tend to shift from one part of the body to that which is close to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, you must continue with the application of the cautery until the patient has healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Regarding the method of applying cauterization for Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Title 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	However, leprosy sometimes benefits from a more intense application of the cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And particularly the species of leprosy which arises from phlegm and melancholy putrefaction: therefore, consider how vigorously to apply the cautery against it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then leprosy is spreading, and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not descend, nor remain stationary: and you judge that corruption has spread over his entire body. Then cauterize him over the head with five applications of the cautery: one in the middle of the head which is known, and the second below this towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, and two above two horns, and one after on the cervical bones.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And with the last touch of your cautery, gently continue until it prints a small impression in the mouth and the layers start to separate from this: so that the heavy fumes' expiration is relieved from there, and cauterize also with the cautery on the spleen itself according to what precedes.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	And if leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly visible then you should apply these treatments as we said in the head and use cautery on the end of the nose, and two applications of the cautery on the cheeks, and two applications of the cautery on the cervical vertebrae, and six applications of the large cautery on the tailbone and one above it on the belly: and two on each hip; namely one over the entire hip bone, and two over the knees: one over every knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the biceps, and two over the pectoral tendernesses: and cauterize him across all the joints, from the joints of his fingers' hands and feet: and cauterize also over the entire heel of each foot and the knuckles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And take care of the nerves that are above the very last part of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes the cautery is applied over the gum, and with another one over the mouth of the stomach, and with yet another over the anus.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial it is, and the more it heals.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick do not find pain in cautery as the healthy do; for their body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it must be that the cautery is of size and quality according to limbs and joints: as they precede from types of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care that the cautery is made from herb flour mixed with honey and other treatments, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Section on the method of applying the cautery in Shock.
Caput L.	Head L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain member becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but does not heal, then apply the cautery to that numb member according to the size or quality of its parts.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And make your cautery shallow enough to go only through the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with a balm until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes the person is made numb by a cautery applied to certain parts where numbness occurs, such as hands and feet. This happens at the spine's exit points of nerves that move this part of the body: and this removes the numbness.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	However, do not apply it blindly unless one is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the egress of moving nerves.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Head 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is old, and there is nothing from the inventions of medicine: then cauterize on it with a deep cauterization moderately, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the herb flour, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon blood, and rabbit's blood: take a portion of each. Mix all these together and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the affected area until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Head 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer begins, and you stand it: then cauterize it with a circular cauterization around its circumference, as if it was being revolved.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise ones said that it should be cauterized with the last cauterization in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But to me, that doesn't seem right: because I fear it will become infected; and I have seen that happen many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And the right way is to cauterize it with a circle around it, as we said, or with multiple cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Head 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati, and its maturation is delayed, or due to overabundance causing it, or due to the age being weak with little blood, or due to the time pressing for the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small-pointed multiple cauterizations.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then remove it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	And it will hasten with ripening.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you pierce its bladder with a cautery, then apply the cautery, which is thus shaped.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubei, until the skin penetrates: and let the cautery be from what follows diseased, so that the flow of pure things may be assisted.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	And then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Section on the method of applying cautery to a corroding sore.
Caput LIIII.	Title 44.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding sore is nothing other than corruption traveling within the limb, and it eats away at it: just as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corroding sore in a place that can bear the cautery with fire, then apply many small and large cauterizing tools according to the need of the place where the corroding is present.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	And then apply the cautery to every part until you eradicate all the corruption, and let nothing of it remain completely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	And then let it heal for three days, and place on the areas that have been cauterized powdered sulfur mixed with oil, until all the scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	And then care for it using ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	And if after three days you see that new healthy flesh has been born, which contains no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply the cautery again over what has remained from diseased areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And sometimes, when there is a corroding sore, it is treated with an acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For indeed, it rises from the site of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, however, the cauterizing with fire is faster in assistance: and I have already said that its cauterization with acute medicine was divided into sections. Therefore, take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing in Clauis and Verucis.
Caput LV.	Title LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This illness happens many times in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, filtered substance that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed, there is cauterization in them according to two methods: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for the cauterization with fire, it should be like a conical firebrand similar to a goose's bill made of iron, according to its capacity to contain a clavus from all sides: and let there be fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the ignited one upon the clavus.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then move the hand with the cauterizer around the clavus, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the clavus. Let it be for three days, until pus begins to discharge.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply the plaster with rue plants, crushed with salt, and let the plaster be applied over it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the site with a regenerating ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they do not heal and it happens frequently on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet, then administer cauterization with hot water. And it is such that you take a tube made from air, or iron, or from a goose's bill: and place it over the clavus, or elsewhere affected by the issue.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then place a small quantity of warm water in the tube. Keep your hand while you move it with pressure, gently turning it to mark the margin of the tube at the base of the knife-like object. Let the warm water find its way deep down, reaching the base of the knife-like object: and let the patient lie for an hour slightly above the site treated by warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release him, for the knife-like object is removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this to them one by one until you have treated all that belongs to them in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they are removed, with what grows from the substance of the ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	¶ On the method of cauterization in Tremonia.
Caput LVI.	Head 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremor happens to someone due to cold on the nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary that you burn them with four burns, or five over the spinous processes of the spine, and between every spinous process by a burn, and in their chest by a burn, and over their stomach by a burn.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor stops with an olive oil burn, and hastens the recovery from cold illness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	¶ On the method of cauterization for Albaithir.
Caput LVII.	Head 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	At times, there are expelled from the body Albaithir's impurities, that is, pus sores which occur due to rotten materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it should be done initially when they first appear, by burning over every head of a pus sore with a fine burn using the end of a piece of myrtle wood that has been lit with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	And when the long root of the Aristolochia plant.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	And with a lens-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes the small penises are burned at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase; and excess is broken off making them, and they are healed from there.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must happen this after the bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of burning during the flow of blood from an artery at the wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at the wound; it occurs externally or at the incision made by animal teeth or a member's cautery and similar things. And it becomes difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So when such a thing happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger on it: and squeeze it much until the blood is confined under your finger and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place a small olive oil cautery in the fire and many of them: and blow over it until they burn strongly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one from them, or a little, or much, according to the wound and place where the artery was cut, and place the cautery over the vein after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is removed.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	And if the blood is expelled when you raise your finger from the artery's opening and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, among those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Do not cease to do that until one thing follows another and blood is discharged.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, do not burn the nerve which is there, lest some other mischief happen to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to cut it; especially if the artery is large, except with one or four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with cautery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or by extraction when it cannot be extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract and blood is discharged.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it can be tied with thread using strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or apply medicinal substances of which the property is to discharge blood, and bind them with a suitable constrictive bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Those who administer the removal of its action with a bandage and constriction with cloth, or by the positioning of things that are being burned or similar, do not completely cut it off, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If it happens to someone else and there is no present physician nor medicine: then begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of that vein as we told you before, and with its constriction greatly until blood is forced from the upper part of the wound and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed, instead it is applied with cold water from above always in a burst of coldness until the blood congeals and thickens, then it can be cut.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he should consider what needs to be done from cautery or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	¶ The Conclusion of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Piercing, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and similar conditions.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have discussed in the first chapter, every illness where it is appropriate to combine fire for cauterization and medicine that burns, and its occasions, causes of its occurrence, and its instruments, as well as forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed the headings from the head down to the feet there.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter with that same method: to provide the sought-after information for those who are seeking it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, you must learn, O sons, what is found in this chapter from the fear that was present in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, there needs to be a greater caution in it, as the operation which is performed in this chapter often leads to blood loss, and the maintenance of life stands at an opening of a vein, or a incision over a boil, or an opening of urine flow, or healing of wounds, or extraction of arrows, or incisions over stones, and similar issues; from all these there comes trembling and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I advise you not to fall into the trap of what causes hesitation, for sometimes people with various illnesses will come to you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For there are those who become angry with their illness, and death is gentle to him: due to the severity of what he finds from his sickness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when illness is from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is he who gives his doctor to you and grows with him in hope of health, but his sickness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it does not mean you should agree with him who comes to you from them, whose measure is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be more intense than your greed and your self-interest.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which confirms that which leads to a commendable succession at your place.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use it in the care of all your patients, for prediction and indication towards what is beneficially suitable for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	Therein indeed serves as an aid to you in the attainment of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, my children, to understand His will, and not take away your guidance and inspiration from Him, for that is within His control.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed, I have arranged this chapter by sections, following the order that came before in the chapter on cautery, from neck to feet: so that you can find what you wish from it and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ On the treatment of water which is combined in children's heads.
Caput I.	Head I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this sickness happens many times to children around birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of a child without lifting it.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed, I did not observe this sickness in others but only in children; and death threatened every one of them from it: therefore, it seemed to me fitting for me to abandon the operation on such matters.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw among them a boy, whose head was filled with water, and the size of his head increased every day until he could not sit upon himself due to the size of his own head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed, either accumulates between the skin and mouth; or accumulates under the bone above the sinuses.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in such a case, if moisture is between the skin and mouth, and there is little abscess, then it must have a groove in the middle of the head one in width: and let the length of the groove be as long as two knuckles until the moisture has drained.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the spatillum.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two grooves according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the openings of the skull from all sides: and water is compressed when you press it with your hand to the interior, and what happens does not hide from you: then it must have three grooves in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the cut, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the grooves with cloths and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then, wash that over it with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then remove the bandage, and take care of the wound with wadding and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let the head be bound with equal tightness.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person with all dry food with little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method for the incision is, that you observe where the size of the abscess becomes visible, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes there is more in the back of the head, or at the forehead part, or on the right side, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So ascend with your incision where you see the abscess and the filling of water: and divide that according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, do not cut into the artery and let a flow of blood happen, and the sick person may die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ Concerning incisions in arteries which occur behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When someone experiences a cough reaching their eyes or chest, and the usual medical treatments do not improve the condition; then, at this point, the last resort treatment is through an incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	So when you wish to incise them, the sick person must shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then scrape the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then, let the sick person tighten their neck with any of their own cloth.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then observe, where the pulse beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of each one are those that are below the ears and depressed: they rarely remain hidden, except in some individuals.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark both places with a hot wax or burnish: and make the cuts on both sides with sharp blades so that they reach up to the opening of each artery; and do this horizontally across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the blades under the artery and make the cut upwards with your incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the cut be about two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	And when the vein is incised, blood flows out in a pulsatile discharge, which jumps within the internals with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	And if the artery is not perceived by touch, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the length of space corresponding to three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a hot iron and extend until you reach the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what must be released from the blood is six uncia (an old unit of measurement) and perhaps you might release more or less than that.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	Do the whole thing according to the quantity which appears to you from the patient's illness and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then direct your attention to the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	And then, if there remains near the mouth anything from the nostril, then cut that way, so as not to create a hot abscess: then bind the wound with linens sown together.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	And afterwards care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	¶ Concerning the removal of arteries which are located near joints.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man with an old hemicrania, or acute congestion due to acrimonious moisture and heat at the joints of his limbs, or with age-old soda and similar conditions: when he is treated according to methods of medical treatment, and does not bring about this result; then we are accustomed to these illnesses involving the removal of arteries from the joints, or cauterization of them, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of action in removing them is, that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the joints, and reaches to the visible artery in the joint.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	Indeed, it is shown to you by its own pulse, and it is rarely hidden unless in few people, or in the confusion of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the sick person should hold their head with any of their cloth: afterwards rub the area with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or soak the place with hot water, until you see a clear manifestation of it.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I formed earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Next, scrape off the skin with it until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it and pull it up to the higher areas until you remove it from the skin, making sure that it comes out from all sides of the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is thin, then encircle it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut out from that part according to the amount by which its ends extend and are pulled together, and do not allow any blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if you do not cut and if you do not remove it completely, the blood does not rise fully.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Next, drain out of the blood up to 6 ounces, until you reach 3 ounces.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong, doubled thread of silk or from animal gut so that it does not reach the place before healing has occurred and blood flow happens.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the surplus which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if need be, cauterize it with a cauterizing tool until the ends of it are reached and it remains in place.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better if the patient has a fever, or if their complexion has been made hot.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Since cautery consists of those things which help to terminate moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better for the aid.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after removing the arteries, it is necessary to fill the cavity with an old cloth: and they should place over it small bundles of centrally made reeds.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the discharge is treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to be born and with licains, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If during the operation a blood flow occurs from an artery, then quickly cut it off with cautery or fill the place with wax: and hold your hand until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of these is present for you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And immerse the area with water of extreme coldness until the pain subsides, and tie it according to what is needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because that which is lighter and easier for the removal of an artery exists, it is to be done by applying this cautery with two knives: let the sharpness of both knives be similar to amalgam.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they have much less sharpness than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are as sharp as two knives, each of them tends to cause coldness: and flesh does not come into contact with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	And since there is a small amount of thickness in them, heat from the fire remains within them, and flesh is cut quickly: for this reason it is better with all operations, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with the hot iron: and leave both burning strongly, until they reach the mouth, and penetrate the vein in both places: so that what is between its ends may extend.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	And they do not become entirely hardened with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Section on the care of frequent and persistent weeping from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Title IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are frequent tears, and a flow of them from the eyes, which are on the scalp outside the head: and nothing of medical treatment is applied with medicines when they do this, you see the face of the sick already turning red, and feels a movement in his forehead, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that his hairs are corroded by moisture: and his eyelids are heated by the sharpness of tears: then the old relied on this treatment for them, and called it 'curing with Ense'.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is to shave off the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three cuts across the forehead, spaced evenly according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of each cut be roughly two fingers, with one cut equidistant from the nose's length in the middle of the forehead, the second cut according to the length slightly to either side of where tears would flow, and the third cut on the other side. Make sure not to touch the incisions made for arteries located at both sides: extend your hand away from the continuation of the two mandibles, so that all cuts span an area equivalent to three connected fingers: prepare a sponge or multiple dried cloths for you, with which you can soak up blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the spatula of the two sharp ends, whose following form is described.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is on the part of the temporal region, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin which lies between the two incisions, together with what is above the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this with the spatula, and reinsert another tool, which is named the surgical sharp one, into the first incision. Insert it gently from one part, not sharply from the other part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh added with the skin, and its flat side gently towards the mouth: and push it until it reaches the central fissure: and remove everything that descends from the head to the eyes: but this continues incision until what is visible from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this up to the other fissure from the central fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after blood flows out to an equal amount, press the places from the clots of blood on the wads.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure lint made from old cloth, and place on them wads soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that an abscess does not form due to heat.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, release the bandage, and administer large amounts of water-based infusion.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then use that which heals from the balsam ointment, and other things used for healing wounds, until it is fully healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the care of acute tears and catarrhs that occur in the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When such a thing happens to someone with an acute catarrh, care should be continuous and diligent. Their eyes are exhausted, reddened, and their appearance has become weakened. The eyelids are inflamed, and hair falls out of them, and there is an intense pain deep within the head that hurts and causes sneezing as a consequence: then take these occurrences into account; for unless it comes from many veins, no such material or catarrh will arise.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it consists of using a hot iron to shave the sick person's forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in the forehead in the middle or near one of the temples, approximately half way across, and begin with the incision from the left side to the right: and extend the cut until you reach the mouth. Keep your hand away from the moving temporal muscles during this process, until you expose the mouth. Then dry all the blood off using a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two incision flaps with moistened fingers or linen threads.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then, above the incision, tie with powders: and soak the powders in wine and oil so that no hot abscess forms.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you release that, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing: then it must be necessary to rub against the mouth until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with an astringent regimen that promotes the growth of flesh: like if you take two parts of ground barley and four parts of colophony; prepare this as a paste, and apply it at the time when flesh is born in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On how to care for what falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Title VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Every object that falls into the ear is of one of four kinds: it may be a mineral stone, like iron or tin; it could be similar to a stone from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; it might be a malleable substance, like water, vinegar, and others like them; or it could be some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	So when a stone or any of those things that are not added and do not grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if you then see the stone, then distill something from balsam oil or flaxseed into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the removal of it and have him sneeze while you're preparing, and pinch his nostrils at the onset of the sneeze; after that, place small pieces of cloth or wool in the vicinity of the ear, and then stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this reason, it is performed many times.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not come out, then administer its removal with the use of gestures, that is, with small needles called pizzigarioli. The shape of this tool is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	So if it comes out with the use of gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its removal with an eyeless small and few-folded hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	So if it does not come out through that tool, then make a tube of air, and insert the tip of the tube into the ear opening very much, and apply what is in the surrounding area of the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that nothing goes except the tube by wind: then remove it with your strong suction force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Indeed, it is performed many times in this manner as what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If this method does not work: then take from the snail's shell or from a fish, that is, a small amount of prepared glue with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of the radius after you have placed it centrally on the cheek: then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you remove the wax from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If it fails with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incision before a hot pustule occurs or a cramp happens.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the measure of the incision is that the bloodletting tool should be applied primarily on the head: and remove it from its blood according to the strength of the individual.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn their ear upwards, and create a small incision at the base of the ear at the depressed spot for them: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent until you reach the stone; then remove it along with what is possible for you from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then continue to heal that incision according to your time, speed, and care until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the substance falling into the ear is like one grain that grows and inflates: then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not yield to you for an outcome, then take the spatula thin, subtle, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer it along with this from those grains of the same species that fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that that grain has already been moistened by the steam of the ear until you place a large amount of it: then remove them with hooks, or with a delicate tool, or with suction as we said, for its extraction is facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In water that enters the ear, the sick person should use a sneeze while being in the position first: and now fills his ear with a little warm water. And he is lying on that ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it then goes out through that (method), it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, soft ones, and heat them with fire slightly, and let the sick person insert one of these into his ear opening. And he washes underfoot one from that part, and strikes with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So do not stop doing this with stones and stones until all the water has gone out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And the water then comes out like this, that you take one from a papyrus or an reed and insert one of its ends into the ear. And you heat the other end with fire until it burns for quite some time.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then use another reed, and do this several times until all the water has gone out. And then remove it with a cannula as was instructed with the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the removal of an animal entering into it, if it is a small body, like a louse and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears by sense: then administer its removal with hands and tongs. And his thing is easier than all which are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the removal of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the treatise on distillations, and your care does not apply: then you should look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If it appears there that something is from the worms, then remove that with the hand or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing is apparent there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and insert its subtle end into the ear according to the capacity that the patient can tolerate. Then suck with that forceful suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all the worms have come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you for an exit, then fill around the end of the cannula with caeru (a substance), as I said about the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we said: then administer the distillations that were known to the ancients for worm infections, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring be when you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this tool, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Just as you see, make it out of silver or tin, with the bottom being narrow and having several small holes, while the top is wide.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So it should be that which pushes inside and is within the hollow of the cannula, it should be made evenly from tin.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you like, take a reed and wrap its end neatly according to the size of your ear canal. Then pour oil or juice or whatever medicine you prefer into the cannula and let it be inside the ear. Wait until the oil is pushed in by listening for it and feeling it internally within yourself. The substance being poured into the ear should have been gently warmed over a fire beforehand, and do not use anything that has been excessively cold during distillation as medicines cannot tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the care of complications arising from ear operations.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes, some infants emerge from their mothers' wombs without being punctured.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And similarly, it happens to some people where an operation on the ear through a wound or from tissue that has formed there, occurs.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this operation sometimes happens deep within the ear canal, where it doesn't follow the use of force: and sometimes it affects only slightly outside the canal and follows that direction due to force.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, what happens deep within the ear, and which cannot be comprehended by appearance, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And for the one that follows force, you must place the diseased ear in sunlight and observe it. Then, if you see a visible lump, open it with a fine probe whose shape is as follows: its tip has some small width, and part of it is sharp; and the rest of the probe consists of two soft sides so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	Therefore, if the operation is from tissue that has formed within the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it with strong force until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	And if the operation is deep within the ear: then take a soft, fine rod and heat it slightly with fire. Then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	And if you feel the lump with what the patient feels as a heaviness in hearing, try to open it with ease: and beware not to pierce the ear's nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a piece of lead according to the size of the canal you have enclosed with the Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wounds.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Take the licorice, and steep it in rose water, then grind over it ground cumin, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the pustule starting to dry: then you must extract the licorice, and mix it with another licorice that you will immerse in fat made from rose oil until the pustule becomes warm. Then take care of it until it is fully healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If a blood flow occurs: then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place the pustule over it: and use the remaining treatment which stops blood flow as described in the book on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	¶ On the care of Althea's eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althelil that happen to the eyelids of the eye, sometimes they become wet, and then they dry out.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you should hold them with your fingers: or with a tool, and insert them with tweezers from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place ground cumin on the affected area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood does flow from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And the cauterization of them is better after cutting (incision).
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Indeed, they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	¶ On the treatment of Eyeball granulomas.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often, something occurs on the eyelids that resembles Crandini in terms of its strength and firmness, and because of this, it is called a granuloma. It is an aggregation of coarse moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, an operation exists in them, you should then consider if there is a process of growth going within it, which appears from the eyelid, and they move to all parts, and its result is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, find above that crack across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every side with ease until it opens.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Next, suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however you do not prepare for its removal, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then it will harm the patient in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the crack is large: then stitch that up with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it's small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it and makes it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the growth is descending towards the inner ear surface, then turn the eyelid down, and hang the lump with a hook: beyond that you need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if the eyelid is stretched by an incision, it will not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision with a saline solution: and care for the area with what promotes flesh formation until the patient heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ On the care of eyelashes.
Caput X.	Head X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a grease that is produced in the upper eyelid covering: and it happens quite often to children: and this greases their eyes, and they suffer from morning discharges (possibly meant by 'catarri'), and they cannot see the sun's light, because tears tend towards them, and because of this you see them lying down on their faces always, and on them do they sleep, and their eyelids are wet under their eyebrows, as if inflated already: and Axirnath seems to stick out in your eye when you press that area with your fingers.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method of performing it is such that the patient places his head on your breast.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare it with licorice. Make a circular piece of licorice according to the amount that Axhr Nath contains from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over her, and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath aggregates in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find the center of that moisture and with the tip of a spatula make incisions across its width, and let it not be an opening larger than the one made in bloodletting at depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it may be necessary to remove the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, for Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a piece of white grease in various configurations.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it together with the cloth you had soaked between your fingers towards the outside. And move your hand to the right and left until everything is spread out: and beware not to add anything in the incision so that you do not reach the spatula near the eye and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little with ease into the incision until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, then bind it with powders.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And among people there are those who heat salt and put it into the hollow of the incision, so that what remains from that moisture will melt.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If a pus pocket occurs in a warm area, then care should be taken with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	关于减少眼睛疲劳的方法，即当眼皮变得柔软时，会发生类似于不应有的声音的情况。
Caput XI.	Title XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hair growth occurs in the eyelids beyond the natural cycle, and prematurely, they then harm the eye and cause discomfort phenomena such as excessive tearing, eyelid softening, puffiness, until this becomes the reason for eye damage.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir indeed treats the eye according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by using a cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with an acute medicine, as stated in the preceding chapter on the subject of the cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or, Ataxmir treats it through incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through canals, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your embrace.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is then turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if it doesn't, introduce the tip of a tool into that area, where there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid. Have the tool go through with the thread above, and make sure this area is near to the hairs, in other words, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow out: pull the thread towards the upper part together with the eyelid, and turn it over using your finger.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find within the part of the eyelid under the additional hairs, from the larger lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread and place a small amount of moistened cloth or cotton under the eyelid. Then mark the area above the eyelid with an iron tool to form a shape like that of a laurel leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	But it must happen that the figure is made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because this already varies among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who need it that the part of the eyelid where it is applied should be large in quantity, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, when you have filled the gap above the two lines you marked, start from the larger lacrimal point to the smaller one and make a single slit near the natural hairs, just like the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the whole thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then stitch the two lips together with needle and fine thread using suturing techniques: clean off any excess blood, and ensure that whatever extends beyond the ends of the two eyebrows is adhered to them; if you want to incorporate certain substances for this purpose, do so. If not, there's no need to worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let the suture and thread remain for three days or four: afterwards attend to that matter.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, remove the wound without the suture, and take care of it as it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised through the puncturing of wounds and their coagulation: but the future will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment was taught by the ancients for Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is concern for the sick person within it, and this comes from a good operation, and not from fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is applicable even to Ataxmir: and it consists in the creation of signs above the eyelid which would resemble the shape of a myrtle leaf as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate or combined claws, according to this following shape. Then cut away what is surplus together with the stubs of scissors, according to this shape, having equality in the incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the claw and they do not match; then take an edge with a string in which there is thread and introduce it into the middle of the shape. And introduce another thread near the lacrimal larger, and the other thread near the smaller lacrimal: and combine threads between your fingers having equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand with equal elevation: and elevate the skin over which is marked the fold, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then combine the two lips with stitches to the wound: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if an abscess should occur at your incision or crack, then drain that abscess along with the pus and use remedies of this kind, from ointments that heal.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And it sometimes happens to eyelashes as well, that they turn and become horizontal.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, when using it for what we said about the cut: but the stitches on both sides are more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ On caring for Ataxmir with canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is to convert the eyelid and divide the crack which I described, as narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then, by skill, make two canes or two fine pieces of wood; their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of the hair. And you have already cut in both ends at each side where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both with subtlety on that which is superfluous from the eyelid, and tie two threads from each side tightly, and let it go a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin when tightened will die, become discolored, and decay until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore the process is slow, then cut it with forceps.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it hardens, lift the eyelid: and no hairs will prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two threads which you should make according to this figure, and the amount in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	¶ Concerning the removal of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation is as follows: you should take a fine needle and gently insert a thin silk thread into it.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather the ends together and tie each end with a knot made from thin string; and let the length of the threads be as long as one hand.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then, take another thin thread and weave it under the first one in a short space, and tie knots at its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient lay his head on your chest, and place it close to the sun so that you can see the operation clearly; because this is a delicate surgery, possibly minute in nature.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with Alinxotatis inside the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate into the eyelid as quickly as possible until you remove the natural hair above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up above Alinxotatis: and insert that hair into Alinxotatis: if there is one, or two, or three hairs, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until a hair comes out with an eyelash together with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however the eyelash is pulled and does not allow a hair to come out with it: pull the eyelash downwards until it comes out through the upper hole. You will see it by the eye: then you are pulling down the eyelash along with the thread that you have made in it, until the eyelash exits through the upper opening; then close your eye: for you are pulling down both at once, and the thread as well. Take them out together and close the eye; and let him keep his eye closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it with flesh.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from the natural ones, and pull it out with it: or let him go until he extends by space, and then pull it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	¶ On the care of Alxatrati which happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this happens to the eye with Alxatrati, it is called the Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati can either be natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, the accidental Alxatrati arises from the concretion of wounds, or sections, or cauterizations, and similar actions.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of performing an action on it is to find that concretion and to separate its edges, and to place into it a piece of linen which is located between them, and you bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it should not be that you use things which dry and constrict in its treatment; for if you do this, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was. Instead, use soothing substances such as Greek fennel: mix it with water that has been boiled down with aloe and flaxseed: and apply a balm of some oil that is melted together: and wrap linen around it, and take care of it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your collection of remedies is, that you strive with all your ingenuity, so that it does not harden, according to the shape which was at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And indeed, the operation that we have mentioned is nothing else but a correction of Alzargari's technique, such that it does not revert to its original form.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	The care according to Alzargari for the lower eyelid, which results in a groove or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This is what Alzargari does below, which is truly called Alzargari's technique.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it can also happen by accident.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And an accidental one occurs due to a wound, or a crack, or cautery, and similar conditions.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation for this is to take a needle with two strands of thread, and insert it into the flesh, so that it penetrates from the left lacrimal point to the right lacrimal point, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the skin upwards with the needle, and cut it using a wide scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, then it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if it doesn't return to the proper shape, take a needle and place it in the crack, and turn the eyelid with it. And make two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of both cracks be from the two corners of the incision until they meet, forming an angle; until they are joined together will form this shape of them, and is the letter praise in Greek.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that part of flesh for the length which is at its sharp lower edge, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then unite the separated parts: hold it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them using what we have said about softening medicines and remedies until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Alxatrati happens to occur from a crack, suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make the incision flat under the eyelashes hairline, even according to how much has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a remedy, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the main point about caring for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that one should treat it in that operation according to how it is prepared from the shape of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, it is the diversity of forms that she is: and the careful artisan prepares his skill with whatever mode is possible to him, until he restores the figure to its natural form or close enough, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from operation and tools in many positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	¶ Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people in such a way that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should insert the end of the rod under the eyelid and lift it up. Or extend it with a hook. Then cut through the adhesion with a thin spatula so that it is not at the edge of the incision sharpness, but obtuse slightly. So the patient will not be disturbed during surgery, remove the spatula and damage his eye with its sharpness; and make your cut as if you were removing that adhesion smoothly until when returns the eyelid according to its natural shape, and heals completely the whole adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Apply then salt water into the eye, when washing it with water: or distil it upon itself from a sieve made, from zinc dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and eye with linseed: and place over the eye wool dipped in urine: and use the sieve on the third day, and with the residues, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	¶ On cutting the hoof and elevation of flesh tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Title XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the hoof is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to a hard sieve, fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to the consistency of frozen egg white: which when touched by a metal tool, or you try to grasp it with an awl, it gets detached and the awl does not get stuck in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	Neither of these types start unless from the larger tear duct, until they gradually reach it, until they cover vision and prevent eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation for cutting it is: let the sick place his head on your breast.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Next, collect the hoof using an awl of a few doublings, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Next, take the tip of a needle from horse hairs, cow's hair or rabbit hair. And let it be strong thread and double the end of the needle near by, then fix that in the middle of hoof and penetrate with its point and tie it to the thread and extend it upwards. And scrape off the side of the hoof following the pupil as if you were squeezing it together with the hair up to his hind foot.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then make a cut in the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with a sharp blade or with blunt forceps: and remove the natural lacrimal tissue, so that there is no risk of excessive flow of tears from it.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the claw is extended with only an awl: or with a wire, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it should be scraped using a soft spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware not to let the spatula touch the cornea membrane, and cause a rupture in it, leading to perforation of the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the cut, some powdered salt or something sifted from zinc should be poured into the eye, and it should be removed up to another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the claw is not nerve-rich, and you cannot insert an edge into it, nor can a hook be inserted into it, then this type of claw needs to be treated repeatedly with medicine. It heals as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to cut it, then open the eye of the patient and take a soft, mild-edged, finely sharp spatula according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the claw from above with reason and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming thinner and breaking down, and the reason imprints itself into it, then distill from your own hour into the eye from a sifted product of zinc, or from a red sifted product, or powdered salt: and saturate the eye up to another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation over it until everything of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a contrary condition in your eye for pus to be hot: then you should remove it yourself, and care for the pus until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then, continue the operation upon it with reason until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the eyelid tissue, if it causes great damage to the eye, should be suspended with a hook and the affected part is cut from it: do not make the final incision in order to prevent the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then, after a while, apply red drops from a tear duct sieve or made from zinc until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ On the incision of the Alguardo and the natural flesh in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	A red flesh sometimes occurs in some people's eyes, either composed or overlaid until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the lids outward: and it is likened to the balsamic rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And there is an operation for this as well, so that the sick person can place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open their eyes and gather that whole flesh with the corresponding hooks to this: and hold it with one forceps or in your hand.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut into the flesh until you finish the entire thing with a saw.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be cautious not to harm the eye during surgery: and make your cut at the point where you are cutting it, or with a small spatula as we described in the section on the incision of the hoof nail: or with large pincers which collect the alsebel, according to how its form will appear after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	Once your incision is complete and the entire Alguardo has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or a red powder from medicinal corrosives. Place over the eye a piece of wool soaked in urine to protect it against hot pus.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there is any remainder of the alquadarini and if your blood is warm, and you feel a warm pus formation: then remove the eye and take care of it along with whatever stops the pus.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then continue to treat it together with the operation until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do likewise for flesh that comes into the eye from this kind of case.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that the treatment of any weak eye from its natural disease or from an accidental cause be done with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you find out what part of the body can bear this operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Section 1: The removal of Sclera from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Title Eighteen.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sclera are the reddened membranes that cover the eye and prevent its own action: and weaken the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary for you to first determine if the eye with Sclera is strong and there is no other ailment in it apart from Sclera. If so, then remove Sclera from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And you should advise the sick person to place their head on your chest.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your judgment: and let the hook be thin from doubling, following this shape, or have two hooks graduated in one body, following this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine forks and in terms of fineness, and cleanse the blood hour by hour until you find those veins being removed from the eye, and they resolve. And beware not to harm the eye with the ends of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in midday before the sun, and be firm in your operation very much: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have completed it, then distill into the eye something green or red: so that its sharpness may season what remains from itself.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	And if however you are not able to collect all of this in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which relieves eye pain: and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides: and protect it from hot drafts. Then apply it again according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	¶ Concerning the reduction to the nose of Arissatus.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XVII.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Medicians name the Fistula of Arissatus which is treated with cautery or with an acutely burning medicine, as was described previously.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed, then there is no skill in that: unless you find above the pustule at its birth and extract all of the moisture which is within it and pus, until the mouth is revealed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	And when the mouth is revealed, and you see corruption or darkness within it, then shave it with an instrument whose form is like this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Roughness of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of hot iron, and let its head be round like an azir, which should have a puncture by the file, or a fine puncture from the aliskilfer. Place it above the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand moderately until you know that that corruption is now smooth. And do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicinal dried astringent substances.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the site is stabilized, and flesh begins to grow there, and treatment administration is discontinued: and forty days pass, and there is no renewal, and it does not heal, and no incidents occur there: then you will know that it has been fully healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no natural talent present other than to reduce the sinus back to the nasal opening, according to this method.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is as follows: when you remove the bone secondly with iron or with sharp medicine; and upon detecting the opening of the bone, then take a drill according to this method, let its end be made of iron in a triangular shape. And make that piece of wood pyramidal, tapering down until reaching the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place that over the bone itself: and let it be close to the tear ducts: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it. Through this, when the patient finds the wind to come out of him/her when holding his/her hand over their own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the site with medicinal dried astringent substances, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	And when flesh begins to grow and the site hardens, then the substance that was flowing outward returns to the nose. Therefore, it becomes lighter for the patient above the affected area.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	### On reducing the prominence of the eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye bulges completely and there is no harm or diminution in vision, then it's necessary to relax the patient. Afterwards, perform bloodletting on him/her: subsequently place suction devices at the neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a lotion made from acacia, aloe, nard, and gall.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then, above the ointment with many powders, bind the eye again.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the quantity of powders is as follows: take soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be doubled up four times. Cut them into multiple pieces. Then place one piece on top of another according to the amount that the eye requires. Next, bind them firmly with a hard cloth using a strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat in ventilations with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the ventilation tubes, and let the eye be bound tightly day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If the bandage again becomes soft, then it should be tightened much: afterwards remove the bandage each day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see the eye already return to its usual condition, it is good: and if not, then repeat the ointment, powders, binding, and ventilation tubes until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	¶ On making an incision in the tunica (or membrane).
Caput XXI.	Title XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there is a break in the tunica Vuea, then it rises and extends outside the eyelid like a grain ofVuea, because of this shape and to allow the vision to occur. In that case, an operation should be performed as I describe, and you should insert the tip of a needle from below to above in the base of theVuea.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle that has a double thread at the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut twice into the site, and bind together with it a portion of the vagina by the edge of the needle; and pull it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then pull out the needle, and place over the eye a band dipped in almond juice: and let him go until the string with the vagina falls.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which strengthens itself, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the vagina is tightened with a band around a circle of cloth, until the eye attains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then a fine needle is passed through with a slender forceps, so that it reaches the depth of the eye, and maintains the humidity of almond juice, causing the eye to descend and enter immediately; then tighten it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ Instructions for the Care of Albinet.
Caput XXII.	Title XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This condition known as Alcomnati is not really a disease that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And for how to proceed with this, you should make the patient sit on a prepared seat or directly if necessary.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head with your hands from both sides and move it until you can feel the disease reaching down to the inner parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then apply (the treatment), and make sure it doesn't go down, and the passage is cleared up: and the patient will see as they did before. And if it didn't go down below, know that there's water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If however, the preparation for the descent of the disease as we have said is not made, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine forceps and apply it above the cornual membrane slightly near its continuous part with the cornea up to the rim, until the disease emerges.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore it exits, then drip in the eye warm water that you mixed with honey: or the water in which you already boiled the Greek fennel and honey: afterwards treat with the rest of the treatment until healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Regarding the care for water that descends into the eye or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Title XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	Now we have discussed the nature of water and what is suitable for perforation through a spoken explanation and demonstration. Then take this same thing according to health afterwards.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	So then you must make the patient sit between your hands as a square, facing away from the light, close to the sun: and tie the healthy eye, and tightly hold it. Then with your right hand, if the eye that has water is the left eye, or with your left hand if the eye is on the right side, press down the eyelid of the patient's eye with your hand.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand if the eye is on the left side, or with your left hand if the eye is on the right side.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the needle near the corona along the width of the radius in the apparent white of the eye on the side of the lesser tear duct. Then push the needle with force and move your hand together with it, until it penetrates into the whiteness of the eye, and you feel that the needle has already reached the hollow place.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it must be that the measurement of the needle's journey to depth is equal to the distance from the pupil to the end of the darkened area, which is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	Indeed, you will see those things inside the pupil with the vision of the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle until it reaches the spot where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards, one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If the water therefore descends immediately, then the patient perceives that which he opens with his hand immediately, and the powder is in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If the water therefore descends, then place it down secondly, excepting where the powder will come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it cures, and does not rise: then remove the powder with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some of clear gemstone salt in water, and wash your eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place the whole lump of fat or rose oil-soaked wool, or garlic, on the eye, and bind the healthy eye to it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	And we, as well as those of our time, place on it ground coriander with egg whites.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	And if the powder does not obey you at entering the eye because of its hardness, as it comes from humans whose eye is very hard, then you must take a spatula which is called Alberid, having this shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Pierce it with it only the jointed part, and do not insert your hand into the hole: and there should be nothing but to make a subtle passage where the powder can go.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the powder as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient an appropriately arranged bed on which to lie facing down in a dark room. Let him sleep on his back and be prevented from all movements and coughing. Provide food as nature finds fit for him. Do not move his head with either hand at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the band be according to its place until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Next, release that in that dark house and test its purpose; and make him see this.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to do that during the healing time or immediately after cutting: indeed, he should avoid doing so; because water rises quickly through strong exposure.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if an abscess becomes hot: then you should release the eye before the seventh day: and correct that which is done with it to eliminate the abscess, until the process stops. Then fully test its purpose, and place over his face a mouth opening through which his use can be regulated for several days while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	And then gradually leave the house and converse as usual.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	Know that in zalle (a state of health), the disciple should not be prevented from seeing occasionally; for then he dares to take part in operations.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, some of those who were from Alayrach have reached us, who said that an operation was performed on a hole in Alayrach through which water is sucked.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But indeed, I have not seen anyone on your land who performs this: nor did I read of it in any ancient books: and it's possible that this is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from the hole, so they can stand above those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made from the air properly: and let their ends with this have the same subtlety of triangular shape, and an acute end.
Formae magda.	Forms of Magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of the newly born flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Title XXIV
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes in the nose various added flesh is born, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from this is the cancerous flesh, stone-like, of yellowish color. And from this is what it is soft flesh, not of yellowish color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In the part that from these flesh elements is soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should place an afflicted individual to sit between your hands opposing the sun, and open their nostrils, and remove a hook into those flesh parts. Then draw them out towards the exterior, and with a sharp, fine probing tool from one side, until you know that all of the flesh has been completely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	And if there remains something from that of which removal is not possible: then shave off that with one of delicate instruments with ease, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	And if blood is dominating you, or a hot boil occurs: then place it against what is required: or if it is from malignant boils, then approach by cauterizing it, until the blood has been removed and all flesh has been taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then after cutting into the nose, expel with vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	And if the nose opens up, and moisture proceeds from it until to the palate, then you will know that he is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	And if moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that flesh has been born inside of him in the upper bones of the nose, to which penetration did not come with an incision tool.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary to introduce a piece of linen string which has some thickness, and within the string many knots. Place between each knot an amount equal to or less than that of a finger. The skilled person should then guide one end of the thread into his nose with a tool or as much as he can manage after doing so himself with another similar object: and they pull out their scent until it reaches the nostrils, and comes out over their throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	Indeed, many times they do something similar to this with young boys at school, and it's an easy thing for the one who wants to do so.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the string, one end that extends over the nose and the other end which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Next, perform the incision into the flesh with knots located along the string.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh and knots on the string have now been affected.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the string: and after bleeding out, place in the nose a lint that you have soaked with Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more until the ointment has treated all that remains from the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place a lead pipe at the end of the procedure in the nose for several days until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however there needs to be a kind of treatment that dries out, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the procedure of washing the head with distilled oils and other medicines for use up the nose, make this like a lamp of pyxide shape, with its opening like that of a shell: and let its aperture be made similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed pipe, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a nose-purge, when found complete, should have its handle at the end, with which you hold it. When you warm it in oil or wish to extract from its residues and other liquid contents.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Section: On the care of Thelul's nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	It often occurs at the tip of Thelul's nose, and grows bigger and increases with days, until it forms a characteristic appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for that reason, it is necessary to act upon this when it first appears and remove the whole of it from the beginning.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over that spot, or apply a cautery, or a burning medicine which occupies the place where it was.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the cutting of it does not occur until it grows large, then observe if it is stony, hard, yellowish in color, with few senses: at that point do not touch it with iron because it is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Indeed, I have often seen that if someone incites an enemy to create a boil against the one who possesses it, great harm befalls him.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the boil has a soft touch, is not yellow in color, and you see that it can be cut all over, then treat the sick person, and cut into it fearlessly, without fear: and care for the place with what dries and tightens it until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Section: On sewing of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when the continuity fails in one of these cartilages, there is little to be done about it, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when such an event happens to someone from that, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then bind the wounds together with stitches; afterwards take care of them until they heal.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of continuity of the solution have already been separated and each part is now healthy, then it must be that all parts are scraped off from the apparent skin until bleeding occurs.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bind the two lips together with stitches and tighten them, and sprinkle over him dragon's blood and ground myrrh. Place above these scraps of powder on a piece of plaster of galen, and another piece made by mixing various plasters. And release him from bandages for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then release the person and change the medicine, and let him go until the stitches fall out on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the individual with ointment until they are healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	As for the method of suturing, you bind the continuity of the solution together, or with needles, as we explained in abdominal sutures. Or you bind the solution with a thread, as I have shown you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	¶ On the removal of lumps from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	To many people, it happens that small and quite hard lumps similar to seeds of herbs occur within their lips. And some are smaller, others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and strike over every lump of it, and hang it with a hook, and pierce it from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the cut with a powder until bleeding occurs.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it is rubbed with vinegar and the area where there is an application is treated with it until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	¶ Concerning the incision of birth scars on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Title XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Birth scars often appear on the gum, which the ancients called 'abuluss'.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should hang it with a hook: or hold it with forceps and make an incision at its root, allowing pus to drain out or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place over the area some dried powder, or other止血powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh recurs after healing, as it often does, then make a second incision and cauterize it: for it will not recur after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	¶ Concerning the reason for using iron with teeth.
Caput XXIX.	Title XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes, aggregations form on the surfaces of teeth both from inside and outside, extending to the gums, with rough, unpleasant layers that sometimes degrade further, turning yellowish-green until corruption reaches the gum, resulting in foul-smelling teeth due to this.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should have the sick person sit between your hands, and place their head in your bosom, then scrape the gum and tooth where you see layers, or a resemblance to sand: until nothing remains from them. Do similarly for blackness, greenness, yellowing, and other discolorations, until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore the reason that exists within them from the beginning is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeatedly apply this reason on them each day, secondly, thirdly, until diligent study reaches what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you will know that the tooth requires razors of various shapes, figures of many forms: according to how your operation is prepared. This is because the razor used for extracting a tooth from its lower part is different from the one used for teeth between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors have been prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Section: On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Caput XXX.	Head 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth with all your skill for its own pain, and do not hesitate in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	Indeed, there is nothing that can substitute for it when it is removed: because it is a high substance; until then, when there is no excuse for removing it, then it must be forced by the sick to remove itself, so that it stabilizes and confirms with you the painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Indeed, the sick person often deceives himself with pain and thinks there is a problem inside the tooth and removes it. Then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have indeed observed that before in procedures related to bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	And when the painful tooth has been confirmed to you by itself, then you should incise around the tooth with a small instrument where there is some virtue until the gum releases from every part: then move it with your fingers, or with thin forceps first gradually, until you dislodge it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps on the area of that tooth and have the sick person's head between your knees: you should hold this well enough so that it does not move. Then pull out the tooth according to its straightness, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not protrude, then take one of those instruments and insert it under him from every part with ease, and try the movement of it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is pierced or corroded, then you must fill that hole with a cloth: and tie it with the end of a thin rod so that it does not break when you bind it with your forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you must carefully perform the incision around the gum from every part much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so you do not break it and let part of him remain, which will heal over the vulnerable from that illness with greater pain initially.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And be cautious not to do what the ignorant ones do among phlebotomists during their practice and with boldness over his extraction, beyond which they administer what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Indeed, many times they result in causing great illnesses upon men which are more difficult to break, and let his roots remain all, or some of them; or they extract him with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have testified several times this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then he is rinsed after his extraction with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a bleeding occurs from the places (this happens many times), then rub something with ash and fill it in that place: and if not, cauterize it if ash does not provide you relief.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forceps of fine size by which a tooth is moved at first, let them have long ends, short handles, thick so that they do not fold when pressed upon the tooth with them: let them be as you see of thick handles, until when you tighten them against it, neither do they bite themselves, nor do they fold. Let them have short ends and let them be made out of steel or out of hardened metal, with straight ends: and in their ends let there be teeth, some entering into each other and being held by the appropriate tightening, strongly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes, ends are made like the shape of a bird's mouth which is called the stork, and there is a strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Title XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains during the process of removing a fractured tooth, then you must place tallow over the site for one or two days until the area softens. Then insert an instrument, either by the gnat or forceps: their ends are similar to the mouth of a bird which is called the stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This form is that of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their ends are made in the shape of an engraving chisel: or like the tool called aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not comply with you for extraction using these forceps, then you should cut over the root and remove all the flesh, and insert a tool called a small lever whose shape is as follows.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let its end be short and thick for some distance, and do not let it become wet so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If the root comes out through that, it is good; and if not, one should try with other tools whose shapes are like these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first triangular end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The shape of the triangular end is fine.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	And even with this tool having two branches, which has this shape.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other tools and instruments that precede them in the proportion of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	And even with this tool that is similar to a large hook, of which the shape has a triangular end twisted together, where there is some thickness so that it does not break: and let it not be wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you will know that dental instruments are many: and similarly other tools are not counted, and the skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument according to which he indicates the operation and discomforts themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	And because there are instruments from varieties on which the ancients did not provide tools, due to the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	And if the mouth is fractured from the jawbone or any other bones of the mouth, or it decays: then examine him at his own place with what fits into the situation among the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in extraction procedures, and assist him with gestures, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let some hardness grow gradually in it, so that it may bind or hold the mouth with it, and does not escape and bleed, until the mouth comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if there is a small decay in the bone, then shave it off from its own decay and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the prominent closure of teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	Title XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth grow out of their natural course, it becomes foul due to this form: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, during menstruation.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you should consider it.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	Therefore, if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not situated, or there is a possibility for its closure without needing to grind it, but it cannot be done with that tool: then extract the tooth. And if it is attached to another tooth, then use this instrument on it, whose form is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a thin needle and is made of hard iron, with its tip extremely sharp.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be such that you are cutting into it for many days, and because of the hardness of teeth, and so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	And if there is an exposed ridge from the file: then the file itself with the file of the first kind, whose shape is like this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let it be entirely of the first kind, and make its handle with many small prongs, like a file when making needles. Then the tooth will be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls off: then soften it at the end, and sharpen it further using some razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth from which part breaks and injures the tongue, then one must use a burr on it until all roughness of that break has been removed and it's even: and it should be flattened so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	¶ On the treatment of teeth with golden wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Title 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is shaking and disturbance of the front teeth due to impact or accident, and it's not possible for them to be tightened around what he eats so that they don't fall off: then treat them with astringent medicines, and if treatment doesn't help; in such cases, one must use golden wires on them. This is because silver turns green and decays after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of moderate thickness and size according to what it can fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	The form of treatment is as follows: you would take the wire and introduce its two parts between two healthy teeth. Then weave it with the two ends of the thread through the moving teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the weaving up to a healthy tooth from the other part.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the incision until you reach the place where you started: and hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it doesn't move completely: and let your constriction when you tie the thread be at the roots of teeth, so that it won't grow.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess threads with forceps: and gather them together, then turn them as you do gestures, and hide them between a healthy tooth and a moving tooth so that they don't hurt the tongue: then let this tightness be released when it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If they should break or require further cuts, tie them with another thread and it will stand firm in this manner for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the shape of teeth and the form of securing two healthy teeth and two moving teeth as you can see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after the event of the eruption and are held just as we have described, remaining unchanged. And this is done only by a skilled and experienced artisan.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes it is adapted from the bones of the alveoli: and it becomes like the form of a tooth and placed in its place, thus securing the tooth and tying it as we said, remaining and serving with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Section on incision of ligaments that occur under the tongue, which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Title: 34
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this particular ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, present since birth in humans, or accidental, resulting from an injury that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the procedure involves opening the mouth of the patient at the tip to your chin, and lifting their tongue. Then cut this nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is released from constriction.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there be any hardness or nodule within it and that arises from the healing of wounds, then insert a hook into it, and divide it across its width until you reach the ligament, and resolve the nodule.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be cautious, so that there is no deep cut into the flesh and you do not hit an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then clean the area around the cut with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen strip under the tongue of the sick person, which they should keep in their mouth every night: so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however there is a flow of blood, then place on the site salted meal.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If the blood has dried on you, then cauterize the site with a small and suitable cauterizer: then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	¶ On removing the Ranula, which forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess forms under the tongue that resembles a toad, hindering the tongue's natural operation: and it may grow so much as to fill the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the procedure is, that you open the mouth of the sick person facing the sun: and inspect the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If however you see it is of yellow or black color, or hard, and the sick person does not feel anything from it: then do not touch it, because it is a tumor.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines to a whiteness with moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it down with a thin lancet, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you during your time of operation, then place onto it ground zeger until the blood is drained off: afterwards return to your operation until you have taken him/her out with its completion.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is mixed with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest of its treatment until it fits to that, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	¶ On the treatment of two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat and gland (which resemble cotton), those that occur near the tonsils; and they are called two Tonsils: when you treat them as we said in division, and if they do not heal, then consider this.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is an indurated lump, of yellow color, with few sensations: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color, and the root of it is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing blood flow, indeed release it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it: or it will be ruptured by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and the root of it is subtle: then you must pierce it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation within it is what you should consider before her own operation, if it has completed a warm quiet fullness of the lump, or if it has diminished to some reduction: then therefore let him/her sit for the sick person in front of the sun, and their head be in your chest: and open her/his mouth, and she/he receives by serving herself/himself between his/her hands, and presses her/his tongue below with an instrument, which this is its form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or copper, which should be subtle like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press upon it with your tongue, and show to you the pustule, and let it fall over him by your use: then take a hook, and fasten it in the tonsil, and pull it out as far as you can from within, leaving some of it in the membrane.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the tool whose shape follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is made to be adapted by forking: however, let the ends of it be rounded, so that each ear's hole is acutely in line with another. Therefore, make sure it is made of hard iron or dipped in ale for oiling.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this tool is not present, then cut it with a spatula whose form follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or leaves of myrtle and similar substances from astringents, until the bleeding stops. Then attend to it until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	Sometimes, other pustules appear in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	So cut these (other pustules) according to what I said about cutting the two tonsils evenly.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed, I have treated a woman for a pustule that was born in her throat, which was turning black, with few sensations, which had almost completely narrowed her throat: and the woman breathed from the constrained passage, and she could no longer drink water or eat; and she would already have succumbed to death if she had survived one more day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess rose to the point where it sent out two branches until they reached over two nasal apertures.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I proceeded with great haste and attached one of them to a hook of one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it off where you can grasp it by the nasal aperture.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did to it what had proceeded from the nasal aperture on the other side.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; then I attached a hook to it. Afterwards, I cut off part of him where he had proceeded from the nasal aperture on the other side, and it did not spread except for a little blood. Therefore, the throat of the woman was freed, and she immediately started drinking water, and then she took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	So I did not stop piercing that abscess repeatedly over a long period of time. And an abscess would occur in the place where I had pierced it until it was prolonged excessively and with that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	So I worked on it and burned the abscess between her throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	She stood after her operation: then I walked away from the part, and I did not know what God had done to her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	### Section on Incisions of Wombs
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends into the womb and becomes inflamed, and is long: then it is called a perpendicular womb. And if there is a large, round part at the lower part, then it is called an upside-down womb.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in division, and the treatment does not take effect: then you will see that the abscess has calmed down from her, and it is subtle: at that point, you must pierce her.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is derived from that which is round and does not have length, and is blood-colored or of a yellowish-brown shade, or black, and lacks sensation: then it must be the appropriate excision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	And there is fear upon the sick.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the method I described - white and with length - you should have the sick person sit facing the sun. And press their tongue with a tool as instructed beforehand. Then fix a hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of two tools that were mentioned in the operation for removing both tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it must be that you do not cut from her unless what is added above the natural termination without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut more than necessary from her, you harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	And after the cutting, use what we instructed for the removal of both tonsils. And take care of her until she has healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	And if the sick person is frightened by the cutting: then it must be that you use skill in the operation of cauterization without fear and anxiety.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization on her is not proper unless with sharp water: and it involves placing the sick person's head in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	And then press their tongue with the tool that we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	And then take the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterization and apply it to a non-extinct heel using this tool, making sure not to use too thick or too thin water, filling its conformation with this tool's shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the end where you place the medicine be conformed, just like the conformation of the cochlear radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon one of them: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva from his mouth due to the internal medicine does not descend into his throat, and harms himself.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	And then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should apply the first part of it on one quarter of the hourly dose, until you notice that it has become discolored and stopped the action of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you need to drink it, cover the end of the radius and pour the compound with medicine into the tube. Then insert the rod and knife into the tube from above until the tip of the rod adheres to some part.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Perform this many times until you achieve what you desire for the application of heat.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then release it: because after three or four days, it will detach itself and fall off.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to reapply the medicine, apply it again: and after cauterization cleanse the area around the wound with a mixture of the fat and medicine that is in its surroundings, then wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it is cured externally with ointments, and rinsed internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore, this method of treatment is more beneficial than an incision and lasts longer in terms of concern or worry.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes it heals even with something finer than heat or an incision; it is treated by means of a fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a reed, hyssop, sage, rue, sweet marjoram, chamomile and spinach, and similar plants from herbs. Gather all of these together or some of them in a pot, and immerse it with vinegar, then boil it. The pot should be well scraped inside to remove excess. Place an opening in the middle of the pot, over which place a concave instrument according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver or copper: and insert the end, on which is the pearl, into the mouth of the patient until the steam ascends to somewhere above the tube, until much of the steam obscures it.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then iterate over it many times, until healing occurs.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the onset of leprosy.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	However, it is added in leprosy: and this should not be done unless at the decline of its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this tool is not present for you, then take a reed and prepare its peel at the end of it, so that the mouth of the patient does not burn: because the peel of the date prevents the steam from burning the mouth; and this is part of good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	¶ For the removal of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often it adheres in the throat, either to fish bone or to some other thing.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you should extract what is protruding above what falls when you press the tongue with a tool against the sun. Then it will be shown to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if you cannot see what is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient eat before food is broken down in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps then, something attached might come out through the vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the patient might swallow a fragment of snail, or a lettuce stem, or swallow a crumb of dry bread. Or they might take a fragment of desiccated marine sponge that is soft; then tie it up in thread and swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore he arrives at the place where the needles are, or the mouth, and extracts it, then he exits.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore you do not extract with what we said: then use this tool of lead according to this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius somewhat, and at its end let there be a curvature, which insert into its mouth with ease: and let it have its head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of contact with his epiglottis, so as not to cause him hiccoughs, and push it along with the mouth, or needle, or let the doctor himself thrust it in with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But what the sick person inserts is better; because of his knowledge about the place for the insertion. And he should push from below, or while raising his hand with the tool, all of this according to the amount which has been prepared for him, until it exits.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	¶ On the removal of the Sanguinea.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When treating a sanguinea with what I have said about the division of treatment compared to the treatment by doctors, and if it does not congeal, then consider in the patient's throat in front of the sun or after being under the sun, when you press their tongue with the tool that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your instrument falls onto the sanguinea, extract it with a small hook, or with tongs that are slightly curved.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a bulbous cannula, and insert it into the throat of the patient up to near the throat: then insert the heated iron of the cannula with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times, and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let the treated take in cold water, and open his mouth with it. And let him drink his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water with his hand one hour after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	Indeed, when the leech senses water, it falls off.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not occur with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs, or with a wing using the tool we described for fumigating a fly.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it falls by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation during fumigation is to take a pot containing live coals with it: and the pot should be covered with a cover, having a hole in its middle: and the end of the tool should be composed within that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then release the fumigation, and let the patient place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If however it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the patient will endure thirst, and eat salty things, and herbs, and does not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	So it is necessary that it (the treatment) should take effect with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the tool used to extract a leech from the throat when it falls upon itself.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to tongs, as you see: but because there is this curvature in it that enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is named ciconia, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release itself entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Chapter on the incision of boils, and their sectioning, and care generally.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of boils are many, according to the memory of various ways, namely one and one in this book: and they differ in their puncturing and sectioning from two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	The first method is of the boil itself species, and that which it contains due to humidity.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second manner is due to the places where it occurs from within the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For since boils can occur on the head, it is a different thing from a boil occurring near the anus: and a boil that occurs in fatty areas is different from a boil occurring between joints. Each one of them has its own judgment based on their actions.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among boils are those that should not be pierced until after the healing substance has matured in them and completed its process. And from these are those that need to be pierced while they are raw and have not yet matured according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as boils that are close to joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when a boil occurs near the joint and extends until it decays whatever is around it, perhaps it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint. This is why it becomes a cause for closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is the boil near the main member: for if you delay its incision until it matures, it will either harm him or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	It is near the anus, therefore puncture it in the immature: and there should not be need to puncture until it becomes a pus pocket that has not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus so as not for it to become deeply putrefied and extend into the interior of the anus, and thereby create a fistula, or it happens in the end part thereof which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary for you to know the time of puncturing a pus pocket which has reached maturation according to the full term: and this occurs at the reduction of pain, decrease in fever, diminishment of redness, and reduction of pulse, and acuteness of the pus pocket headache: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary for you to make the same puncturing at the lower part of the pus pocket and at more pronounced elevation: and the puncture should run longitudinally through the body if the pus pockets are in hand parts, foot parts, places of cuts, strings, nerves, arteries, and up until the last uniform places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, puncture with the hole according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when the pus pocket is in fatty areas: then it is better to let the puncturing of it continue until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the full term.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you puncture it before that, the course of the poison from it is prolonged, and there are much pus and inflammation, and perhaps the lips become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some pus pockets are punctured longitudinally across the body according to necessity: or according to where that member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	It is necessary for you to administer a small puncture in small pus pockets and a large puncture in large pus pockets: or multiple sections in similarity to the size of the pus pockets.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And they are from the apscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin should be hollowed out. And it penetrates when already formed like a patch, and reaches to the point, which is already dead: as happens in many cases, such as boils, and swellings.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from these there are those that are cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is derived, from which penetration occurs like the shape of a myrtle leaf figure.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As for the inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them are those in which a round section and a lunar (crescent-shaped) section are administered: and similar ones to these by sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	And this one that does not have a head, such as are the small superficial apscesses, needs to pierce it with a superficial or merely flat perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the apscess is large and has already accumulated much pus, to pierce it, so that you do not press too hard and remove all the pus at once: indeed, extract some of it from itself.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then let the apscess drain until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then again, extract some more from the pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do that repeatedly according to the stages until all of it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or an emaciated child, or an old and decrepit man: for the animal spirit is often released with the ejection of pus. And perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not notice.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	So be cautious on this chapter, it requires great care.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation of the apscesses, you must clean the wound: and inspect it.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore there is a wound due to scythe cuts being scarce or is a flat cut, then administer linseed oil or old copper.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large abscess and many puncturing cracks exist, then you must introduce linseed oil into all the cracks until the inner part comes out.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut a part of the skin in an abscess or hollowed out that area in circumcision: then it must be filled with old copper, or like when weaving fabric, or removing wool from linen without moisture: and tighten it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and take care of that along with what needs to be from the balm, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	And if a blood flow occurs during your operation time, then administer cold water and vinegar, after immersing the cloth in them: and place it over the bleeding spot multiple times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	And if the blood flow persists, then it must be that you administer treatment and care, as well as powders which I have described in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	And if it is during winter and the wound involves many nerves, then you should pour in powders mixed with wine, and warm oil, and place them over the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is during summer and the areas are fatty, then you should place powders soaked in water, and oil, or mix them with wine and oil, and present the entire thing cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until then, when it is the third day as we said, you should remove the blister, clean it, and administer what suits its care until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from knowledge of the treatment of hernias universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the division of the topic however, I have already spoken about all hernias, in what manner is the way to treat them separately chapter by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Chapter 1: On the sections of hernias that occur in the head skin.
Caput XLI.	Head Chapter XXXI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	In the head skin, small hernias occur, and they are of types called Nodums, which contain sac-like tunics: as if they were swollen chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are numerous.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among them are fatty ones: and among them are those that contain moisture like mud: and among them are those that contain moisture like grease and mousse: and similar to these, and among them are those that are hard like stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all, and during their removal there is no fear, since at their section, an artery does not oppose itself.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	The procedure for the operation on them is such that you would experience it with the tool whose shape comes after this, which is named the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if there is that which contains moisture, then cut it along its length in a superficial manner: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the cut from line b to line g. As the moisture is evacuated, then scratch away the lump that contains this moisture, and do not remove anything entirely from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Indeed, if there remains something from it, it will recur many times.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Next immerse the head in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt. And fill him with this up to a wound, and release it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	Indeed, it eats away what remains of the stump.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then cut it with the Egyptian knife over what remains of the stump for the second and third time. If you need to do so, until you are sure that nothing remains from the stump. Then take care of the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it contains a large whitish lump: then cut it according to this form, with a section having the shape of a cross. And remove the tips between the sections and scrape it from every side. And try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however, an artery opposes you, then do what I will instruct you to do next.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly handle it if there is an abscess with stones, from the section and care of which are the same as what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And cutting through an abscess with stones is easier because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which occur at the head in certain people, where there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is this: because I cut over the abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess to be like a solid stone, hard, rough, white that couldn't break. And if anyone hit it while trying to remove it, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But with other abscesses that occur on the head, apart from these abscesses which happen in children's heads and near the ear roots, the cutting of all of them is a superficial cut.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or rather, always make a puncture from the lower part of them, so that the course of healing may go downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then, care must be taken in accordance with what is suitable for their treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Regarding the dissection of Strobilus in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These hernias often occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And among those that occur in the neck are one kind and many kinds; they generate from each other: and every Strobilus is within its own proper membrane, just like it is in the knots and hernias of the head, as we have told.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	The forms of these Strobilus (Strophula) are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from them there are stony ones: and from them are those that contain moisture: and from them are malevolent ones, which do not comply with treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, for the one among them that you see with good disposition to touch, whose evident color is close to that of skin, and moves throughout every part, and it is not attached to neck nerves, neither to guideg (ligaments), nor to artery, nor it is deep: you must make a superficial section in her from the upper part down to the lower body part along line b. to line g., and scrape her off from all sides: and extend two skin flaps with an incision tool, or with multiple incisions if needed as we said about hernias of the head and elsewhere, and extract her gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And caution must be taken so that an artery or nerve is not hit.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the cut not be too sharp: so that you do not hurt your own hand with the cut or disturb the patient and accidentally hit something unnecessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you do hit an artery or vein, or if the operation is hindered by this, then place in wound Z some powder that coagulates blood, and bind the wound, and let it go until the pain of hernia subsides and the wound heals: or it may begin to putrefy if desired.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is removed by division, therefore proceed with your operation until completion.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Next, use your index finger to inquire, if any part of the Strophilae remains with others: therefore cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the root of the Strophula: then you must not cut that Strophula from its root. Indeed, it is necessary to bind it with a doubled strong thread and let it fall until it drops without injury.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Next, fill the incision with the old wadding that you have already prepared in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then attend to it yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the Strophula is cut completely, then it is necessary to join the lips at two wounds: and its own action should immediately be observed after you see that there is no excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that the excess remains because of the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to extend to cutting its root and extracting it: and administer the stitch we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which from the Strophilae contains moisture, puncture it with a superficial incision: so that you may see its maturation place: and make the puncture below where the body follows, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the puncture, apply licorine with ointment and similar remedies, so that it may heal what remains from the corruption, until you see that the wound is already cleansed: then attend to it with the generation ointment of flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ On cutting the epiglottis in an accidental injury within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Title: Chapter 43
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this incision is made on the epiglottis, and no one from our land has been seen who would perform it: and here is the writing of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	When they have a double swelling (synanche), it is necessary that an incision be made on the epiglottis. If this does not produce improvement through that method; therefore, because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canals, it must use an incision on the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that comes from pre-irritation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we are performing that operation, it is necessary to make the incision on the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, a small cut across its width, at the point where there are two circles, with the amount being an incision in sifacum (or possibly the soft tissue), not through the cartilage: and this particular location is suitable for the incision because it is shielded from the skin and blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	And if the surgeon is timid, then it must be that he stretches the throat skin with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then cut the skin until he reaches the canal: if he sees anything from them, cut the blood vessels.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then cut the sifac (or possibly a specific tissue) as we described: and it indicates on the canal's section from the phlegm that comes out of there, together with what is broken, and the removal of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And let the wound be open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	And when the hour comes that is feared for pre-irritation, join together the two lips over the wound of the skin, and its own thing alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines that cause flesh to be born, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis said.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this speech that we have narrated is not an exposition unless one notices that a patient has already drunk some of these remedies; and the sick person rises above death and wants to be cut open. They go up to the second epiglottis so that the sick person can breathe over the wound in a certain way, and they are saved from death: for this reason, they command to let the wound remain open until the sickness's malice is consumed, and it takes three days for its malice to become as good as cured: then they instruct to heal the wound, taking care of it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And the thing that I have seen by myself is this: a maid took a knife and sent it to her throat, and with it she incised a part of the bronchial canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat him, and I found her moaning, like the groan of the dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I then examined at the wound, and found that a small amount of blood had flowed out from the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I concluded that she did not draw the blood away or apply any bandage, and that air was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore proceeded to treat her wound and care for it until it healed: and nothing happens to the maid except a harshness of voice: and she returns after days to better conditions.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Thus I say: there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ On the section of the throat hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Title XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This is called Hernia Gutturis, which is large pus pocket according to the color of the body, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And there are two ways for this: either it is natural, or it happens by chance.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural case, certainly there is no design.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	By chance, it occurs in two ways: one way is similar to large lumps.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to a pus pocket that forms from a lymph node.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in it. It is not necessary to make an assumption about it with iron, except in the case where it is scarce; you should test it and investigate it with an introduction (instrument).
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If you find it similar to a large lump, and it is not suspended by any veins: then cut it as they would cut lumps. And extract it with whatever is contained within it if there's something inside the lump; if not, then thoroughly examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with whatever needs to be taken from treatment until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	¶ About the sectioning of nodules of this kind.
Caput XLV.	Title XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules and I have already described all kinds of them in division. And it should be that here I describe the difference between a Nodule, and an Ejection: when there is confusion causing doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say then that when Ejection is warmth and fever and severe pains until the overflow of excess subsides and the putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the knot does not have warmth, nor fever, nor pains, and contains them in bags like that which is their own proper sack, and is according to the color of the body: and it begins as a chick, and grows as a pea, and can be larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to treat the Knot, it is necessary for you to experience it and inquire about it first with the tool called the Intromissum, according to how its form will appear in the chapter that comes after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigation for all Knots is that you take this tool and introduce it into the moist area found in the apostema. Then, move your fingers with it gradually until you know that the tool has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place the last part of your hand according to the size of the apostema.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove the Intromissum, and examine what comes out during its investigation.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If moisture flows out, regardless of what color it is: then dry it by cutting superficially, as I said about other apostemas.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not come out during the investigation of the Intromissum, then you will know that it is fatty. Dry it by cutting over it in a cross-shaped area, according to this shape as I taught you: and suspend it with clips, and scrape off the skin from every part easily: and keep the sack if you can above it, so you can extract the healthy one along with the Knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the sack is broken during the operation and it's not possible to extract the healthy one, this happens quite often, then remove that (Knot) hastily until nothing remains from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if there remains from it somewhat little or much, the second knot returns according to most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it defeats you and something remains from it: then fill the wound at your completion with some ground and corrosive sharp powders: and tighten the wound, and place above it what sits a hot pustule, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore it is a large Knot, then cut its two lips, and care for it with what creates flesh with it.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however it is a contrary pulsating vein, or not pulsating: then press it, and fill the place that I told you to grind, and release it tightly for two days, or three, until the wound rots and the blood ebullition ceases: then return to applying what remains from the Knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ Concerning the tools for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	These include the forms of introducers, and there are three types of them.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Among these, there is the large one, among these is the medium one, and among these is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron with square ends that taper inwardly, so they facilitate the introduction into the pustule.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of the probes and needles: namely, those that pierce. And one of them is named 'beris', meaning 'piercing': and there are three types of them.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Among these, there is the large one, and the medium one, and the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	It is necessary that they investigate through these pustules, discharges, and fistulas, and swellings, from what is between them in the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles on which sewing thread is stored, from lemon wood, or from air, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better ones are those that are made from lemon wood.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also done with black lead, which are used to understand the output ducts of which the curvature is reflections, so that they should be reflected together with their reflections with their smoothness.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them there are the long ones, and the medium ones, and the short ones, according to the size of the curvature and tightness of the output duct.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of hooks, and there are many types of it.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them there are simple ones, that is, those that have one curvature. And there are three types of it as you see; Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are Blind Hooks: and they come in three varieties.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are hooks with two curvatures, and they come in three varieties: and from them there are hooks with three curvatures, and they also come in three varieties: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, which cut and scrape Nodes, and eruptions: and they come in three varieties: for from them is great, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The ends of them by which the section is made are sharp, other ends are not sharp: they are not placed like this, unless so that through them a benefit may be achieved in scraping Nodes at the fear of incision of veins or nerves, and through them the sick is healed and finds tranquility to some extent from the heat he finds during scraping eruptions.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the Magdas, and they are of three species.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made from air and resemble the device used to create alcohol, with a broad tip hidden under what appears like a spatula. And in its extremity, there's a hole that flows into both inner and outer parts when needed, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the spatula which is hidden between fingers at the puncture for piercing wounds: and those who are ill do not feel them; and they come in three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the Ventricle tools used to stop blood flow, and they come in three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made from air or lemon, spherical, somewhat according to their length as you see, and let them be for subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And you must have these varieties of Ventricle tools as large and small ones for you, so that you can stop the blood flow with them at speed when necessary, and then when there is no medicine present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you do not use them for stopping blood flow in every part of the body and only use them in fatty areas: like at thighs, hips, and arms, breasts, belly, groin, and similar places from fatty, moist areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes tools are made from them that are small and resemble finger blades according to their shape. With these, blood is removed when it flows from the phlebotomy site or upon incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Chapter on the care of human breasts which resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Title: 47th Chapter
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When certain people's breasts become inflamed at the completion of a dream (that is, when they start discharging during sleep) until they resemble women's breasts; and they remain as disgusting as they were before.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever avoids this, must cut across the breasts at the lunar section according to this shape from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fatty substance.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with ointment from cooked medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then stitch together the two lips around the wound and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the nipple, however, droops downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it must be cut in two upper sides by two similar sections of a lunar shape, each kept together with the other at both ends until there is a line that contains smaller one. After that, scrape off the skin which is between two lips, remove the fatty substance, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders as needed for treatment until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not apply the incision required because of the patient's anxiety or bleeding: then you must fill the wound with a submerged cut in ointment corrosive and let it out until it corrodes what remains from the fatty substance.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	For the perforation of scabs, which happens under the penis.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These scabs that occur under the penis are from the hard species of Strophularia containing seeds, and among them are those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	What then are those among them that contain moisture, they must be cut sectionally at the lunar line, according to this form, from line b. to line g. Hence, when everything that is in the apse is evacuated by the sponge, then fill it with new coagulant and release it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the scab is removed, and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	And if there is an abscess of the type of nodes from the Strobilus (a genus of plant), then cut above it as we said in the division above for the Strobalis, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	And if the wound extends to such an extent that pus is emitted from it, then apply a cautery to it, as we said in what was previously addressed.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Regarding the division of abscesses which occur due to an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes hardened, it often results in an abscess. Similarly, with veins as well; an abscess may occur within them and lead to inflation.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which one can recognize that an abscess and inflation are due to an artery and vein are as follows: because when it is an abscess due to the artery, it is long in length, aggregated deeply within the body: and when you push on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a scraping sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is round and visible on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And cutting above this abscess is a mistake, especially if it's below the armpits, groin areas, neck and many other parts of the body: it is a large operation.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it should be ensured that its care is provided with iron, and what is also present among them, whether at the ends or on top, should be treated accordingly.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Beyond this, concerning what is from them, originating from the expansion of the artery opening, find it in the skin layer in the longitudinal direction.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with pincers, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Next insert an incision beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places according to what I taught you in removing two arteries that are located inside.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Next pierce the place which is between the two ligaments with fat, until all the blood within it comes out, and dissolve the abscess.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Next provide the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off: then care with suitable ointments is applied until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the abscess is due to the cutting of the vein, then you should hold your hand against the skin with the part of the abscess that allows it from the abscess together with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Next insert a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and have a double thread inside until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with the good abscess bandage: as I told you in the bandage of the womb, with two parts and two ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread will be extracted, then insert another needle with a different thread under the abscess altogether at the point of the needle incision: press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then drain the abscess at its center, until what is inside comes out: then remove excess skin and release what is tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on him the poultice that you have prepared in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment which is performed with ointments and unguents until he/she is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	¶ The abscess that occurs from the twist of nerves.
Caput L.	Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess may occur in an artery or vein, similarly, it can also occur in nerves. This happens due to a blow or results from excess effort, and similar factors. It occurs very often in the areas of supports, heels, or any part where joints move. And it becomes a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it appears in various positions without causing pain. And when it is squeezed with unease, one feels a kind of weakness or dizziness within it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an aggregated abscess within the depth of the body, rather, it lies beneath the skin, and can move to every part of the body. It does not affect things in front or before, nor behind it.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, whatever there is at joints should not be poked with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps a contraction will occur, though.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which is from them, whether in the head or on the forehead, take off the skin with a small incision.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it off. Afterwards, remove it, leaving an ulcer, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the surgical division of scabs, which occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Title LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	There occur among some people many times within their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, what are called 'Thelil', which resemble fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is subtle, and their head is large, and the lips of them are reversed.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is little from them: and there is much that magnifies greatly from them.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed, I have seen a man and within his abdomen were two 'thelil', which resembled fungi more than other things. There was no difference between them, they had a white, fine root, and their lips would be reversed, they could be found, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So I dealt with them and found that one weighed almost X and VIII ounces, and the other was almost VI ounces. The operation during their cutting is as you might consider it at this time: if a sick person is moist, and the color of 'thelil' is white, moist, with a fine root, then cut him along with his broad spatula, and have the cauterization present for you in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Indeed, much blood is expelled during its division; therefore, if you are overcome by his blood, then cauterize him.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the sick person frightened and timid during the incision with iron, then take a plumb line made to be twisted, and twist it with it: its method is as we said, and let him have it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add in the twisting of the plumb line.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore, do not stop twisting the lead until it imprints on the 'thelil', then cut it off and let it fall by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If the root of the large thistle is thick, then there is some concern and weakness in its incision: primarily that which is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to hit its midpoint during the operation.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not recur.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Next, take care of it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful not to assume that you have hit a thistle of a yellowish color, which is insensible and has a foul appearance; for it is a cancerous boil: and I will cure it with reference to the remedy after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	### On the Care of the Navel Wound.
Caput LII.	Head 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel prominence (eminentia Vumbilici) arises from various causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or it may arise from slits, which are above the belly: and it exits through it either an almond, or of the intestines, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or it may come from blood that flows from the vein or artery, as previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or it may be due to constriction of the abdominal area.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it arises because of a slit and the exit is that of a boil: then its color resembles that of pus: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears to have various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it arises due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is more diverse as we have narrated.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	So when you press it with your fingers, it will disappear: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it is greatly manifested inside the bathhouse, and a severe discomfort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is due to humidity, it is tender, then it does not hide when pressed by your hand, neither squeezing nor addition.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is due to blood, then with these signs an eruption appears turning black at the edge.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If it is due to living flesh: then the pustule is heavy, large, hard, and discharges according to a single quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is due to wind, then its touch is tender.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that is to be considered, then if it's due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or wind, causing the prominence of the navel: then you should refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and terror in that, as I taught you in the chapter where I said pustules due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominence of the navel is due to an intestine or hay fever, then you must advise the sick person so that they may hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with hot branding iron around the entire circumference of the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then advise him to be fanned between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then apply with broad applicator around the circumference of the navel over the spot you marked with the branding iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend several pustules upwards, with a large curved implement.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him tightly around the waist with a strong thread or with a firm silk ligature string: and let the knot of the ligament be two fingers wide.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open up the extended pustule above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you cannot find the already captured thing from the ligament: then pull out the gut that has been prepared beforehand, and insert a finger into it, and push the intestines towards the abdomen's inner parts: and if you find a string, then take it with a hook, and cut off its surplus.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the contrary is to you an artery, or a vein: then encircle it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles into the band you made around the pustule like a cross, making those penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	And stitch the pustule in four places on the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and let the place be until the flesh has decomposed when stretched out: and it falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and decomposes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	And then take care of it with what is needed from the ointment until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the elevation of the navel is from the nostril of flesh in it, or from dampness: then you should create a pustule as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find inside it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	And then take care of it with what strengthens the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	¶ On the care of Cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed the division of species of Cancer and how to approach its treatment with medicines. We must be cautious about treating it with iron, so as not to cause an ulceration: we also spoke about generated Cancer within the body and precautions in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes a Cancer is found at a place where its removal is possible. Such as the one in breasts or thigh and others similar which are on parts of the body ready for extraction of the whole thing, especially when it begins to be small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When I want it to harden and it is large, you should not bring it close to it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal anyone from this; nor did I see anyone before me who has succeeded in achieving this.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation for that, as we said when it is localized like this, consists of leading (it), and discharging the patient from black fever occasionally.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	And then if you find the bloodletting method with obvious fullness (of humor).
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient for preparation which will include the description of the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	And then produce in the Canthus uncus that agrees with it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	And then hollow it out from all sides with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains from its roots: and let blood flow out and do not cut it quickly. Instead press on the area, and remove all the thick blood with your hand or whatever is possible using instruments there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	However, if the thick blood flow causes you difficulty from the cut of an artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And then care for it with all other treatments until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ On the Care of Water Distention.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 44.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already discussed the division of types of Water Distention, and how water aggregation occurs: and the signs for all types, as well as the treatment thereof with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is only the asclitis type alone: and it should not be brought near to the iron of the tympanic species, or the hypo-sacral species; for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated thus, if there remains a type of hydro-pneumonia that does not respond to medicine: then reflect.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	Indeed, if weakness has already followed him, or another ailment accompanies him besides hydro-pneumonia: just as if a cough is with him, or an abdominal loosening, and similar to those: then beware not to treat him with iron: for that is fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	Indeed, if you see a weak person overflowing with strength, and there is no other illness besides hydro-pneumonia: and he is not young or old. Then the way of treatment in him is that you lift the sick one standing between your hands, and the attendant pushes his stomach with their hand forcing water downwards towards the lower parts using the ribs.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take the thorny spatula, according to this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It should have two sharp parts, be long, with an acute end like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But there should be somewhat of shortness gradually in it, so that you do not pass through to the point of operation until you reach the intestines and injure him.
Deinde considera.	Then reflect.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	Indeed, if hydro-pneumonia originates from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary for you to extend with your cut from the navel by three fingers' length, downwards directly above the ribs.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	Indeed, if hydro-pneumonia is due to an ailment in the stomach: then your cut should be on the left side from the navel three fingers' length.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its origin is due to the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side: and it also need not be a cut on the side under where the sick person wants to lie, so that no excesses flow to that vulnerable place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then puncture with a tool all the skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that section and raise your hand with the Spatula between the skin, and do it as if you were scraping it off: and let the amount to be scraped be equal to the thickness of a nail or roughly so.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then puncture and continue until the Spatula reaches the empty space: and there will be a place for water to flow.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and introduce an instrument into the opening, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: made of silver, or copper, or brass, smoothly polished; at the lower part of it there is a small hole and on both sides of it are three holes, two from one side and one from the other: and its end is cut like the incision of a reed, as you see; at the upper end of it there is a loop.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the tool reaches the water, then it immediately descends over the tool itself, thus evacuating from the water a quantity of half.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate more than necessary from it, then perhaps the patient may die through the escape of his soul's body fluid: or it happens to him apoplexies which approach death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the strength of its virtue, and according to what is indicated to you by the patient's condition based on their pulse strength and health.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then extract the tool, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is because it gets retained immediately due to the skin that retains the opening which is above the Spatula: about which I have spoken, that you should puncture it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then use the tool on another day if you see that the patient can bear this: and also extract a small amount from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Perform that for a few days without fear, and guard yourself against error: until there remains in the water nothing but a little bit.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If you are afraid for the weak one, and let out from water much of it: then care for it with the burial under hot sand, and abundant sweating in a bath and sunlight, and wait until there is a reaction: and care for it with dried medicines until it heals: and cauterize over the stomach, gallbladder, and spleen, after the removal of the water: according to what I have described in that which preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	¶ On the care for infants born where their bladders were not punctured.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When anyone of the infants emerges from their mother's womb, and if the head of its mother is not punctured, or there is a narrow opening, or it is in an incorrect location.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, assistance must be given immediately with the puncturing of its mother's head when it is born using a thin and sharp tool, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a small, thin metal key into the opening and bind it in place. Keep this bound for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	Therefore, when the desire to urinate arises, remove the key and let her pass urine.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then put it back in place.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead (plumbum), it is possible that the urine which goes over the spot will prevent it from closing.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	That is why if there is a narrow opening (foramen), it is treated with lead as we have said, over many days, until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those among them who have an opening (foramen) in the wrong place get hurt.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	What is that, because among those who are born, there is an opening at the tip of the dart (or projectile): therefore it cannot penetrate forward until he raises the dart with his hand to the upper positions.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	There is no generation for him, therefore, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it causes very harmful nausea.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in this case is to have the sick person lie on their back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the end of the dart with your left hand to a considerable length, and cut off the head of the dart from its base, using either the point or an acute tool: like a cut made by a knife, or as if you were cutting something like a root, so that the middle part becomes similar to the head of the dart; and let the opening fall in the middle exactly where it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of blood flow during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this happens many times.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So oppose him with the one who removes blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	### About Albucasis: Issues that occur in the prepuce and head of the dart, as well as corruption, blackening, and sticking.
Caput LVI.	Title 56: Head.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albucasis issues often occur in the dart and result in the prominence of harmful flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from that, there is one which is evil and another which is not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-evil one should be hung with a fine hook and cut until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place its head submerged in Egyptian oil for treatment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then continue with care following that with dyaffinic oil until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If Albaether is malevolent and of a foul color, then it is necessary to apply the cautery to it after its cutting and its reason.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If indeed Albaether is confined within the foreskin of a man who has not been circumcised and it is part of Albaether between the foreskin and its part outside: then you must remove the Albaether which is inside in the first instance, until when it heals. Then care for the external part: because when you care for her at the same time, it will not heal the foreskin that it tears.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And it happens as well in the testicles and in the blackened and corrupted prepuce.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should cleanse the entire area that has already been discolored and what intends to spoil or is already spoiled.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply on it afterwards with honey that has already been cooked with flour from miller's grain and ground herbs sifted through a sieve.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for this in conjunction with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If bleeding occurs, then apply the cautery with the lunar cautery according to this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	Indeed, the cautery is useful for two dispositions simultaneously, namely to stem bleeding and to heal a wound when it is spoiled.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the staff is corroding and everything is destroyed at that time: then you must insert a leaden tube into the prostrate cavity so that the sick person lies on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In adhesion of the prepuce with the head of the staff, and these adhesions do not happen unless in him whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required over it. Sometimes adhesion happens due to a wound or abscess: therefore, you must remove that with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the staff is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then it becomes necessary to scrape out something from the tip of the rod, and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is because the prepuce, when it's delicate, might be pierced due to its delicacy and quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the rod's head with a thin linen cloth that has already been made wet with cold water, so they don't stick together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with a止血 wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	¶ On the cleanliness of infants and care in dealing with mistakes that happen to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution to continence like other wounds: however, since it is an outcome of our action, by our choice, and its usage suits infants specifically, it becomes necessary for us to signify in this operation a better one, and a less burdensome path leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say then, that the ancients did not say to perform circumcision on any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I have found that a larger part of surgeons and bloodletters use cleanliness by circumcision, when performing with new knives, and using pincers. They also bathe in herbal decoctions, bind with thread, and make incisions with the hoof.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed, I have tested all these methods and found no better form of cleanliness using pincers and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleanliness performed with new knives, the skin tends to peel off multiple times.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the prepuce has two layers of skin: thus perhaps the upper layer of skin is affected and leaves behind the lower layer. One must then be prompted towards making an incision for the second layer and expecting pain in the future.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the operation that is done through the anus, that is, with the finger, which surgeons use, does not secure the cut of the end of the male member: because perhaps it enters into its aperture.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In the case of reduction however, perhaps a knife is used and it might ruin your operation: and indeed the nature of a child's skin is short-lived, and many times such children are born that they do not require reduction: and I have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	As for reduction using forceps and a ligature with thread, I have found good experience in it: because the forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, the sharpness above is like the sharpness below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they intersect at one time during the operation: and there is compression similar to a figure, containing the skin of the rod from every side, with which no error falls entirely.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The proper method of the operation is to make it understood, particularly with children, if there are those who understand a little more than you do, that you do not do this unless you tie the thread only in his rod and then release him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be merry to the extent that you can give this back to his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then have him stand between your hands prepared for the operation, and do not let him be sitting. Hide the forceps in your sleeve or under your foot so that the child does not see them at all, nor anything else from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand to the rod of him, and blow into the skin, and draw it upwards until the tip of the rod goes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from that which is mixed with it in dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Next, bind below it similarly to that part according to.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament's retention well, and cut between two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upwards either gradually or quickly, and pull out the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (it is better thus), and place a poultice above; and on top of the poultice put a piece of cloth where the yolk has been spread, cooked in pink water, mixed with oil. Recently well: and let him rest upon it until another day: and take care of him with the remaining treatment until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form for using this tool for cleansing is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	There should be two equal parts for the ends and they should fit together: so that the rod does not escape from them: and let their length be as twice the length of two fingers equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But an error occurs in the process of cleansing: because possibly the entire skin or a part of it escapes at the incision point.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should extend it from the time of your appointment with your fingernail before the dissection point: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with the hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If it passes three days and what is under the rod remains swollen, dissect it: then let that which has formed remain warm until you can gently scrape off the scab, and cut it according to preparation for you: and take care from above the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, attend to that, along with what hardens the wound as described in our treatise on powders. And if it goes beyond the skin reaching upwards and affects higher areas, that too will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, take care of that along with what we said, until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ On the removal of Retained Vagina in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Head 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction made from a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or newly born flesh, and similar things from what we said about methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine does not resolve, and you identify its retention to be due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder: then it should have a patient placed on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then have his feet placed on his back and let him extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back. And have the patient hold his breath as much as possible for himself.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus it is forced towards the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone, whereby urine is relieved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not resolve with what we said, and if there are difficulties for the patient to overcome: then you must administer his removal with a tool called a syringe, which has this form. It should be made of silver, and should be fine, smooth, conical like a quill feather in thinness as thin as a ray's width, long in similarity to the length of one and two hands: there should be a thin cannula at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of urine's exit through it is as follows: take a doubled thread and bind good yarn or wool at its end: then insert that end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is excess from the wool, but insert in the cannula with breath just like that.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then immerse the sponge in oil, or with butter, and with albugine: and have the patient sit on a seat, and soak the blister, and his staff with moist oils, and oil of olive, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the staff until it reaches the end of the staff.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the part above from the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into that part until it reaches the blister, and the patient should feel that it has reached its intended location; this is not done according to this order unless the opening through which it travels is in the place where there is a twist.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the string with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	Indeed, the wax follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then remove her (the patient), and make the urine flow through the passage of urine with the wax: and repeat the syringe procedure, and do not cease this practice until the bladder is emptied, and the patient will find relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	¶ Regarding the quality of the bladder enema with Clepshydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LI.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder or blood freezes within it, or pus is confined within it, and water or medicines are distilled into her (the patient), then this must be done with a tool that is named Clepshydra. Here is its form:
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed blind or, in other words, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And it has three openings: two on one side and one on the other, as you will see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place where that which pushes is located should be of such a size that it can push itself without addition until something is drawn out with it from the wetness. And when it is pushed, whatever is pushed out goes far away: as Clepshydra does, which expels naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the sieges of war.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When then you wish to evacuate the moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the hydropistis into the moisture and draw out with it whatever is being pushed upwards. The moisture is drawn into the concavity of the hydropistis.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the rod, as we have described it in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Next, push the moisture along with what is being pushed by that, for the moisture immediately reaches the bladder, so much so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of thin enemas through which the bladder is filled with enema liquids.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or copper alloy: where the head is higher and similar to a small water jug, and below it there's a notch for a ligament.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder on the rod, and place in it the moisture with which you wish to fill the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Next, bind it between two sinuses with a strong knot using doubled thread: and warm that moisture slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the enema into the rod. Afterwards, hold your hand over the bladder with a tight grip on the moisture until the patient feels that this moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however there is no bladder available to you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circular shape out of it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert the thread strongly into those holes, as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Next, gather the circle like it is gathered for an ointment pot: after you place what you wish from the moisture, oils, and waters into it.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then bind this also into an instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder while expressing it by your hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the Extraction of Stones.
Caput LX.	Head 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	Now we have discussed the division of the species of stones and their treatment with medicines. We have differentiated between the stone that forms within the kidneys and the bladder, as well as its signs throughout. We spoke about the operation when performed by hand and the cutting: The stone formed in the kidney is properly called a stone. That which is shaped like a rod is that one; and I will recount this with clear exposition and succinctly.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say then, that the stone formed in the bladder occurs most frequently among children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And by its signs, it is observed that urine comes out of the bladder like water in terms of its thinness: and there appears white sand in it; the sick man uses his rod to rub against it, he labors with it, and hangs down many times.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises, and is expelled along with them (i.e., the stone or matter) in multiple instances.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy, up until they reach fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult among the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	Among adolescents, however, there is a middle ground, which lies between these conditions. And for him who has a larger stone, the treatment is easier: and if it is smaller, it is the reverse of that treatment.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	So when we come to the treatment, it is necessary in the first place to cleanse the patient with a cathartic, which will expel all the feces that are in his intestines: for sometimes the detection of the stone hinders inquiry.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the patient take their feet and be handled, and be agitated towards below: so that the stone may descend to the depths of the bladder or flow from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under his hips, so that the bladder becomes completely inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the Stone in its place, then quickly approach with your section above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must cleanse the index finger with oil of the left hand if the patient is a child. Or use the middle finger if the patient is a fully grown adult. And insert it into his anus and examine about the stone until it lies under your finger. And gradually turn him towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger and push it outward against the place, where his strength lies: and instruct the attendant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another attendant to extend the scrotum with his right hand up towards above: and with other hand remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where there is a section.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the entering spatula, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find what is between the anus and testicles in him, not in the middle but on the left side as it is born: and let there be a cut above the stone, and your finger be inside the anus: and make a cut across, so that the external cut is broad and the internal narrow according to how much possible egress of the stone from there could be without being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed, if the finger that is inside the anus presses the stone at the cut, and it leaves without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you will know that from the stone which has corners and margins, it becomes difficult for its passage because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from that, it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, for him who has corners and margins, add to the wound.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	And if it does not proceed in this way, then you must devise something over it: or tie something over it while making a movement opposite to the center, whose end will be like the Moon which ties over the stone and does not exit from there; or insert an instrument under it with a subtle tool having a curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	And if you cannot make something over, then widen the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	And if anything is stuck to you by some blood, cut it off with your knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	And if the stone is more than one, then push the largest towards the opening of the bladder first.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut down onto it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push the smaller one after that: and do similarly if there are more, two by two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	And if the large one is very big, then ignorance is to cut it off from above with a large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the sick one of two things, either he dies or an event occurs that there is frequent distillation of urine: because the place does not completely consolidate.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it exits: or devise something to break its fracture with picks, until you extract him out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	And when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with thyme, aloe, and dragon's blood: then tie it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that the pus bed rests warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then incline the patient upwards on their neck, and do not merely untie the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When then you have解开 it, wash the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the patient with the salve of myrrh, and the basil salve, until they heal.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If it happens that pus forms in the wound when heated and corrosive substances are added, or similar remedies, as if blood were congealed in the bladder and urine is prevented from passing through it: then recognize this by the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	So insert your finger into the wound and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it will provoke decomposition of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then cleanse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply all kinds of remedies that are suitable for its treatment until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary to take care of the entire period of treatment by binding two thighs and bundles, because of the medicinal substances that are placed on the spot.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	And if the stone is small and lies within the canal of the spear, and becomes stuck inside it, preventing urine passage; then take care of it with what I will instruct you before proceeding to surgery.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Indeed, after performing many sections through this treatment, I have already proven that it works.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it happens that you receive the perforator from iron armor, which has this form, its ends are triangular and sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with the spear under the stone so that it doesn't go back to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the rod with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone. Then rotate the Perforator with your hand within the stone gradually. And refine the puncture until you make it penetrate from another side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Therefore, urination is immediately relieved.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand onto what remains of the stone from the outside part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks itself, and comes out with urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this cure is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it from him: then tie a string under the stone, and another string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut across the stone in the rod between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then dissolve the bandage and clean the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a string under the stone unless you do not want it to return to the blister: and another string above, unless when the string dissolves after extraction of the stone, skin returns to its place, and cooperates with the wound. And for that reason, it is necessary for you to tie a string above when you are tying it up, so raise the skin upwards, so that it returns at your completion, and cooperates with the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	¶ Extraction of Stones in Women.
Caput LXI.	Title LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is formed [in women] only sparingly.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if such a person has a stone, then the treatment is difficult and prevented due to many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that a woman perhaps may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will show herself to the doctor when she is chaste, or from those married.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third reason is, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, particularly the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth reason is the distance from the stone's location: hence deep incision is required, and there is fear involved.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Which means that if necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a female doctor, well knowledgeable; and such is found only partially.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you remove that, then seek out a chaste and subtle doctor, and present him with a well-educated female obstetrician in matters of women's issues, or a woman who has taken part in this art. Therefore make her come before him, and especially instruct her to do everything as commanded by the examination on the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, what is done, that she examines if the woman is a virgin: then it must be that she inserts her finger into her anus, and seeks out the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, restrain him under her own finger, and then command the obstetrician to insert his finger into the weakening abdomen, and inquire about the stone after placing his left hand on the bladder, and compressing it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it must be that she moves it gradually from the urethral opening to lower parts with all her strength until she reaches with him to the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then cut over him at the midpoint of the bladder near the root of the thigh, from whatever part it is prepared for him, and feels the stone in that part: and his finger does not move away from the stone, restraining under it: and let the incision be small first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert the rod upon that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore it feels a stone, then he should add to the section according to the proportionate quantity that the stone comes out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the appearance of stones is many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For they come in various forms; some are slender and large, soft and rough, elongated or round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	And you should know their variety so that by this over the following point, you may be shown to them.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add to the place where it was, ground substance, and keep it for an hour until the blood is removed.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make ready with you from tools, which I said about extracting stones in men, so that you may assist by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	And if the flow of blood overcomes you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery which has been cut; then place the powder on the spot and bind it together with powders in accordance with what is suitable: and do not let this be. And remove the stone, but do not take it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps, indeed, the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	And when the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place has decayed, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ On cutting through the aqueous hernia.
Caput LXII.	Head LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery string is not present, unless it is an aggregation of moisture beneath the white sheath that contains the testicles, which is within the skin of the scrotum. This is called the sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes there is a specific pouch for itself within it which nature has prepared in the scrotum until we think that: which is something else, and it's the skin of the testicle between the whitish albumen as we said, and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this happens due to weakness which occurs in the testicles: therefore, this substance flows towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens due to impact on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	This moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or indeed its color tends towards yellowing, or it is red with a tinge of blood, or it is feculent, black, or it is watery and white, and that which is more abundant.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where there is an accumulation of water are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if there is the whitish albumen as we said in the scrotal sac, then the blister is round to a length that matches somewhat the shape of the scrotum: and the testicle does not appear because the moisture contains it from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own scrotal sac, then the blister is round with a part of the scrotum's shape, and because of this, man judges there is something else besides the testicle.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the whitish albumen, then it falls under common perception.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	So when you want to understand the color of moisture, then experience the color of moisture within the blister with an inserted square, whose shape precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, judge about what is between that and the inserted exploration, as it emerges in investigation.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to treatment with iron, then you must advise the sick person to undergo bloodletting if it is possible for him and you see that his body is full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he is stitched up over his back above a somewhat high mound, and place many cloths under it.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and instruct your attendant to sit at his right side, who will extend the stick of his towards one of the two sides of the scrotal skin, and towards a portion of the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula and cut the scrotal skin from the middle longitudinally up to near the pubis: and make a cut according to the line which divides the scrotal skin into two equal parts, until you reach the white substance encompassing it. And remove or cause him to be removed as much as the amount that is possible with your removal, making sure the excision comes from the part hanging down more along with the testicle: and examine carefully with the excision according to what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then puncture the white substance full of water with an enlarged puncture and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then divide the two parts of the section with scissors, and extend the white substance to the upper part, without touching the skin encompassing the testicles. And cut into it as much as you can cut it for yourself, or completely, especially the finer side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there will be no safety that water does not reappear in its incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however the sperm duct protrudes outside its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the section of it, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then stitch together the two folds of scrotal skin with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for him as you would other wounds until he is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find that the sperm duct is corrupted by another source of darkness, then it will be necessary to tie the threads which are used for support, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut out the testicle with its suspension and pull out the penis: afterwards take care of it along with what we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is aggregated into two parts, then you will know there are two roots. Therefore, cut off the other part according to what you did in the other one equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, such that there is but one operation, then do so: afterwards remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the sections wool submerged in oil or in rose-oil. Then place another piece of wool outside that you prepared in wine and oil. Lay it over the two testicles and cover with a pouch. Place above this doubled cloths, and they are the poultices. Secure them above with the ligament, which has six parts according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths and soak them, then fill them with dyed wool according to this likeness: and create ends where pressure is exerted from the crotch or wet wool. These should be bound together with the bandage in the loin area. One end will go over the anus up to the back, and the other goes up to the hip part. Two ends then go over the two lower thighs and the other two go over the two inguinal areas. The whole bandage is then tied together in the loin area.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this root is treated artificially with a cautery instead of the cut section by iron. You should take a fine surgical knife and make the incision through which the testicle skin comes off. Then ignite it as we have described until the white part containing water is revealed. At that point, you should take the cautery in this manner.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that fimbria with it and heat until all moisture has come out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend it with hooks and scrape it with a fine-ignited cautery. Cut it as much as is possible to you until all of it has been removed.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And draw from the egg, let the fire not touch itself.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is beneficial, and lasts longer after blood flow, and is better than an operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if it causes opposition to you during the time of cutting, or at the moment of applying a hot blister during cauterization, or blood flow, or anything else: then you must treat what causes opposition in accordance with the treatment that suits it, as was stated previously.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is timid and does not anticipate this operation due to its horror: then apply a puncture according to what I describe: and it is done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are informed by you through the thing we said about indications, that ramis is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then puncture the blister from the lower part with a broad spatula: and make the puncture according to the length of the body, and let it be an open wound until all water drains.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place the bolster over the site, and bind it, and let it drain until the rest of water flows out: then take care of it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if opposition is present during the ejection of water when you puncture it, and this happens not otherwise because a white piece of cloth causes opposition in wound openings, and prevents water's exit: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound or a tool used to remove water from hydropsy patients, whose form has preceded. Or add something similar during the operation on wounds.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you will know that urine returns and aggregates around six months, or roughly about that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	And when it aggregates, then the sick will be cured in the same manner, and the patient will pass their diseased days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the care of the fatty tumour (Ramicis).
Caput LXIII.	Title LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	And you will know that in the cutting of this fatty tumour, there is danger of losing more than necessary in various situations.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me beneficial for its dismissal from that situation.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the procedure for that, and looking at the characteristics of the apophyses (protrusions).
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many apophyses occur in bodies which make up the testicles; and this happens for various reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or due to acute overabundance which spills into the testicles, or due to sharp ones that overflow them.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of apophyses matches the color of the body, and no pain is felt: and it is heavy apophysis.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone apophysis whose color is dark brown, and there is no sensation with it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it occurs from the knotting of arteries and their expansion; as was already recalled earlier: or from the expansion of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	And what is due to expansion of the arteries can be recognized by the arrangement of apophyses when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it entirely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which occurs due to the expansion of veins does not scatter anything when compressed with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that a section can be made over this form, and over other meats: and there is one which cuts the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Next extend the scrotum upwards and pull out the testis with a piece of white string. Free the suspension from the vessels and tie off the blood vessels, then cut the suspension after you have released it completely from all parts of the scrotum.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the scrotum is consolidated with those born meats, then it must be drawn out and cut.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adherence between something from the saphenous vein, or within what is between the vessels; then it must be that you free all of this adherence and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	And if there is a birth of flesh at the site of the adherence which is behind: then it must be that you cut out all of it, and remove the scrotum as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards care for it along with other treatments until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	¶ On the care of Ramicis which is with the Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Title LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It refers to a pustule that has been rolled up in a similar way to a ball, with the softening of the testicles; and it makes walking difficult for the sick person due to movement and exercise.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness, it's done with caution, considering what came before as a reminder.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	However, we must say that the operation for this is according to how the first ones did it.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I thus say that you should have the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the testicle suspension downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, together with the muscles that are close to the bones; and let another assistant support them and stretch them vigorously.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad, sharp knife across the urethra in a straight line until the muscles are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove from every side as we have instructed you on the removal of arteries which are found in the veins.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Next, hold with the tip of an incision where there is a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the threads happen to meet the wires: and then tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut those things centrally with a straight cut according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from the decaying feculent moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Next, take care of the wound as you would of other wounds where disease is likely to be produced, so that the nourishing arteries which supply one testicle may fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not bad through this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it happens that the wires have all been affected by the threads, then they must remove the testicles with the wires because otherwise it would deprive them of their nourishment due to the incision and cause either healing or drying out which would not be beneficial for them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ On caring for Intestinal Sticks.
Caput LXV.	Title LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this Intestinal stick is from the section that occurs when it extends over the abdomen in the part below the groin from the lower part of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	This rupture is either due to a cut (sifach), or by its stretching.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	These two kinds of accidents happen from many causes. Or by being struck. Or by jumping. Or by loud noise. Or by lifting something heavy, and similar actions.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign occurs when it's due to stretching or cutting.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	What happens gradually over a long period and does not occur suddenly; it results in an equal depth pus pocket: because the cut compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	The sign for this when it's due to cutting a cut is that it causes sudden intense pain immediately: and there appears an unusual pus pocket beneath the skin nearby: and this occurs because of the passage of the intestine and the flow of its contents towards the external cut.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it comes out with the intestine in grains: and this is called Intestinal Furuncle, and the grain. And sometimes it occurs with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and gets retained there: and this is accompanied by weakness in the sick: because it causes an unpleasant pain to occur, especially when pressure is applied.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of sickness caused by these categories, there is fear with iron: therefore, it is necessary to be cautious about situations like this.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	The method of operation is to guide the sick person, so that they can bring their intestine back into its inner concavity with their hand if it conforms to the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then, it is wrapped up over his neck between your hands: and lift up his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin which follows the skin towards the head and cut the skin of the testicles completely along the length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix at the two edges of the incision with hooks according to what you need for opening the incision with them: and let the cut be according to as much as is possible so that it may come out from there completely.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Next scrape the spermatic cord and what is under the skin of the testicles until when the white scrotal sac becomes visible, hard from all sides: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white scrotal sac, which is under the skin of the penis, and the white scrotal sac, and completely to the point where there adheres in the posterior part of the penis.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Next, move with your right hand towards the interior of the testicle skin: and as you do this, extend the white scrotal sac upwards with your left hand: and lift up the penis along with the white scrotal sac to the cutting area: and instruct your assistant to lift the penis upwards fully: and then resolve the adhesion completely in the posterior direction.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers so that there is nothing from the intestine involuted in the white and hard scrotal sac.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find anything from that, then push it downwards towards the abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Next, take a thread with a thick core, made of ten threads: and insert this at the very end of the spermatic cord, that is, the layer which follows the skin of the testicles towards the cutting area: then cut off the protruding ends from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then compose some of them over some with a figure that is in the shape of a cross: and tie it to the white scrotal sac about which we spoke, for it is a strong ligament under the skin of the testicles, until no more discharge from them can send anything towards them: so as not to happen there an inflammatory heat.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the banding after the first banding, making it longer from that by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two bandings, make a cut in the place that is under the scrotum skin, with the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely according to roundness, and remove everything from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the scrotal skin, from where blood flows, and heal it properly: as we have told you in what was presented beforehand.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Next, apply the fat that has been soaked in oil and place it in the wound: and apply the bandage as we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And at times, what we called the white suture is cauterized after making an incision in it fearing blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this happens many times.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And cut the bandage until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If the situation continues though, then it is treated with warm water: and place upon it what we have said until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care the wound like any other wound, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	§ On Windy Willows.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In these Willows, I have not heard of anyone who was daring enough to use iron in treating its cure with it.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And at first they said that it behaves like what we have described for Willows growing with Vine, as follows:
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, that you bind the wound after cutting it above with ease below: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it until the threads fall off: and care for the wound as we have said until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	On the dissection that occurs in the inguinal region.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the inguinal region, as we have said, and there is an elevation of the area, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, then this is insufficient, and returns at all times. But if it extends with that time, an opening is added into the sifach until the intestines descend into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens with the extension of the sifach which is located in the inguinal region as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	This happens because the sifach is extended; then it softens, the area becomes loose and elevates.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with cautery, as was previously explained.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron according to this method: and it should be that the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then, cut the ruptured and elevated site of the ulcer through its width, according to the length of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the saphenous vein and, what is beneath the skin, until you reveal the white saphenous vein, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a thread and place it over the elevated area from the saphenous vein, and press it deep into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then apply two points of elevation over the end of the thread from the saphenous vein, and connect one end with the other using stitches. Then pull out the end of the thread.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the saphenous vein completely, nor tighten any other thread, as I have taught you in the treatment of bowel hernias.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then that is the care and treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	And when you fall upon a thread, cleanse that, and restore the wound until it has consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The sinew contracts, and does not increase in height, of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better in this place: because it is closer to recovery.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ On softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles becomes softened in some individuals, due to which the flesh between them softens as well, and it ruins their appearance.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is requested to treat him that he makes the sick lie on his back, and allows the entire softened skin to fall over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then gather the two lips with stitches: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin with three stitches or four, and secure it firmly.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	And then continue with the treatment of the remaining wounds until they have healed, and remove the stitches when necessary.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that Castration is prohibited by our law and for that reason I would have preferred not to mention it in my book. And there is no need to recall this method unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	The first reason is so that this procedure might be known to the doctor when he is asked about it and so that he knows how to treat those who undergo it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another method is that we often require the castration of certain animals for purposes beneficial to us, such as sheep, horses, cats and similar ones from among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I therefore say that castration occurs according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or through wear and tear.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or through cracking and severance.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In this method, which is performed through wear and tear, the procedure goes as follows: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles soften, become more relaxed, and hang down. Then, with your hand, you shave them off until they fully resolve and are no longer visible upon touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In the castration through cracking and severance, you need to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut across all the sections in one place until when two eggs proceed: then proceed after you have shaved both of them, and do not leave anything thicker than a fine thread above, which is over the testicles.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which occurs through wear and tear: because wear may leave something from the testicles, for which the animal desires mating.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	### On the Care of Hermaphrodites (in Two Ways)
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite can be derived from females in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that there appears within it something akin to a space or an area on the skin where the testicles are located, with an image similar to that of a woman's pubic region including hair. Sometimes urine runs out from what is present on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women there is a single species, and it is the case that a woman's nose extends beyond her hairline like small testicles in men, protruding to the outside. Of which one resembles a prepuce of a man, and two resemble two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment for three species, two from men and one from women, is: because you must cut through the added flesh until the impression of them has escaped.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then attend to the remaining wound treatment.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine emerges, which is within the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and indeed its treatment is not entirely.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	¶ On the incision of the Tentigine (a term used for certain parts of the female anatomy) and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tentigine may be added over the natural part until it becomes disfigured and ugly. In some women, it sometimes becomes so large that it expands like in men, reaching up to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you should remove the excess of the Tentigine with your hand or using a hook, and cut it. And do not end the cut mainly in depth at the root, to prevent bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then attend to that wound's treatment until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Flesh that arises is flesh which grows within the womb's opening until it fills it; and perhaps extends outward according to the likeness of a tail. And because of this, some label its discomfort as having a tail-like feature.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you should cut it just like you would cut the Tentigine and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the care of Ailritic, which is a non-punctured woman.
Caput LXXII.	Head 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Ailritic is, whether it be a woman without a puncture, or there exists a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it can either be natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is due to an illness that preceded it: and indeed, it can either be added naturally to the flesh, or as something fine, or thick: and it occurs either deeply in the womb, or on its sides, or at its top, or at its bottom. And it prevents intercourse, fertilization, and childbirth, and perhaps also menstrual flow.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	Knowledge of this is obtained through the examination of gynecologists, if it seems to be closely adjacent and observable.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not observable, then seek it with your fingers or using a tool like a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If the obstruction is from something fine and thin, and it is closely adjacent to both lips: then gently approach it, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And you will place them over the two little lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the tips of both your hands simultaneously, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread out.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength until you break that fine obstruction and allow the opening to open up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take the thread, soak it in oil, and place it at that location. And let the woman use this every day so that the location does not harden instead of other treatments.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If it is thick and coarse, then you need to remove it with a broad spatula like the leaf of a myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the surgical dressing is made of flesh naturally, then hang it with tongs and cut it. And have with you medicine that stops blood flow without piercing, such as Acacia and dragon's blood, and mix it together with albumen oil.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply a large leaden cannula so that it does not harden or quickly close the wound. Keep it in place for several days. Then apply linseed oil and after this follow further treatment until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes births occur in the womb of other kinds of flesh: Therefore, they must be treated according to this method: while there is no abscess, for a cancerous abscess would oppose iron entirely and not agree with it.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	¶ On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Aethehil and Botor's method for blood loss in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	Title 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of venous channels, until much blood flows out continuously from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	And when hemorrhoids occur, they become thylas. And I have already spoken about their types and signs and said what ones can be treated with them and which cannot.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say then, that hemorrhoids which are within the womb's opening and do not show themselves to touch: for such ones there is no treatment with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	As for those among them that are within the womb's opening to which touch can extend, these are the ones that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, you must have the woman enter a cold room.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then apply Aethehil with needles or with rough cloth and cut them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder them with substances at the time of blood flow from one type of cut without corruption: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and turmeric, and similar to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then push his feet against the wall one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Next, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the blood flow persisted: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and lemon peel, and gall stones, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a paste with it to apply on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood flows with it, it is good: and if not, make suction cups stick to her back and breasts without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the extract of tarrah, or the extract of the tongue of a calf, or the extract of the branches of aloulath, that is, aglantur, Pontic wine, and make it stick with a goad.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess has ceased to form, then take care of the site with ointment until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is also red like headscarves, and has an uneven appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore you must cut what appears from it, according to what I said about the thylis equally: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ Concerning perforation that occurs during parturition.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Various types of abscess may occur in the womb, such as cancer, and abscesses of stones, and ulcers, and reddened spots, and blistery rashes, that is, herpes, erysipelas, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and thelilias, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed, I have already discussed all these illnesses and types of them, and their symptoms, and their treatments within this division. It is necessary to say about this treatment of a hot pus pocket that occurs in the matrix when it is from pus pockets that collect sickness, and one must know how its opening is done with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you must consider this.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain in the pus pocket at its beginning is sharp upon hitting it, and there is a flame, and fever: and you see it turn red: if it falls onto it with sensation, then do not press it when perforating it: and treat it together with it whatever helps for maturation until when the intensity of events subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat which has two seats, and reclines her, or ties her up over her own back, and gathers her feet towards the lower part of the belly: and let her thighs be spread out, and places her arms under her knees, and ties each with accompanying ligaments to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife sits from the right side, and administers the tool with which the opening of the matrix is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	The form of which arrives in those who are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this tool, that you hold with the woman's deep radio: so that what comes out from the tool is not deeper than the depth of the matrix, and harms the sick.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If however the tool is more than deep, then it is necessary that you place needles over the layer of depth in the matrix: to prevent the entry of the entire tool into the depth of the matrix: and it is necessary that she puts a whirlwind which runs in the tool from above side: and hold the tool, and rotate the attendant whirlwind until the depth of the matrix opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the excision is evident, and felt with the hand, and is soft and spongy: then it must be cut off at its head with a broad knife.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the incision is healed properly, then it must be placed into an immersed wound in rose oil: or in green oil, where there is some stictic acid: and place the dressing and extract the section deeply from the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the matrix and over pure woolen thread immersed in water, into which the apples have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then cleanse with the appropriate ointment for two days, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the matrix and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or long artemisia has been boiled. Then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden internally within the matrix, then it must be treated with iron and rather treat itself according to what we said about division for its care over a long period.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	The doctrine of the treatment of living embryos, how they are treated when they are born according to an unnatural figure.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first of all the natural figure of birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From these signs you can tell that when you see a woman press herself down towards the lower parts, and she desires to breathe in air, and she delights in what is on her regarding birth, and eagerly anticipates the exit of the embryo: then you know that this birth follows the natural figure, and its exit is above its head, and with it comes the afterbirth or placenta: or suspended, or hanging from the umbilicus.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress his abdomen, so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends over its head, it also descends a thread with it, and is cleansed from those excesses by a good process of purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	And the one who is other than this birth is unnatural, unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands: or its head and one of its hands emerge: or its abdomen emerges: and perhaps it turns onto its own neck, and similar unnatural figures from such disgraceful illustrations.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the Obstetrician to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how cleverness exists in that, and it will be explained through this, and it stands upon him.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges over its head in its natural birth process, and then this happens to the woman, making her delivery difficult, and you see her strength already weakened. Then make her sit on a chair, or women hold her: and let her breathe through steam with cooked fennel, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the Obstetrician should introduce a small spatula between her fingers and find a thread with it, then clean it with her finger until she removes whatever is inside from the moisture: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If however it does not descend, then the woman should be treated with a suppository made from fennel mucus, mixed with safflower oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then instruct her after the suppository to be compressed and make her sneeze with pepper, and keep her mouth and nose closed at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus would come forth immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come forth first, then it is necessary that you should gradually return them with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If however it does not yield at the entrance, then place a woman on the seat and raise her feet upwards. Then strike the seat towards the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall with the impact.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come forth and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the rest of the fetus. And bind its hand with cloth and pull it out with equal force, for he himself will come forth.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo over its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes forth over its own feet, then it should push them upwards. Then gradually turn the fetus. Afterwards make it level.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come forth up to the hips, then instruct her to squeeze and have her sneeze when she bends over. For she will come forth if God wills it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come forth as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	Then he will come forth then with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is opposed by everything we have described: then take from the aloes' mucus, and sesame oil, and gum dissolved: and crush all of it with good mortar beating. Then strike it up with a woman's voice and below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then have her sit in warm water until the uterus sinks.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that his parts are already heated, then make him an ointment of myrrh: and suppose it yourself.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she has held the hour once, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and pinch her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the stomach with ease.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	The fire will immediately come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The birth of the fetus is above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges according to this shape, then introduce his hands gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman is to be supinated on her neck, and her feet are to hang down below: and she herself is to lie on the bed, and join her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gradually over his stomach.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is under his feet from the uterus until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take his feet and move them with a vigorous movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the lower part gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert his hands and gradually equalize the fetus: and instruct the woman to compress until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The birth of the fetus hangs laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The hand is to be introduced during reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however she cannot reduce it, then lift the woman up and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk either, then have her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the lotion which you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If it accepts the birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then devote yourself to the reduction of the hands, and equalize the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to pinch herself until the child is born.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The birth of the fetus over its own neck, with its hands extended, and its face is turned towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the fetus' hand, then gradually rotate it, and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When she has equalized, then place on the oil-covered area as we have described it from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to be squeezed: and make her sneeze while lying down.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The birth of the prepared fetus over the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends through the mother's opening according to this manner with a thread, then divide the thread with your nail until it discharges by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is hanging over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut her from the navel: so that she does not be retained and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus into the insides until you place her according to what is necessary; and instruct the woman to pinch herself from time to time: for she will come out by a slight birth.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The Outcome of Twins, or Multiples.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins frequently are born: and sometimes three, and even four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, this is an exception and it rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	But there is a fifth case which is outside the natural order and they do not live completely: and includes them, even though they multiply, into a single twin: and they are separated by the cord, distinguishing each one of them by their umbilical tie.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge as an individual fetus would naturally and easily emerge, just like we have described. And there are cases where they emerge in a most difficult manner, as we have recounted.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them have difficulties during birth and proceed to the situation we described using unnatural diagrams, then treat them as we have instructed. Let there be a delicate scalpel, and let him perform the operation with ease and caution, adapting his approach according to every diagram, prepared for it with skill that leads to healing.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of what is formed from embryos within the womb and what results in miscarriages.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes within the womb, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed. And indeed, it has been observed by me that a woman experiencing miscarriage expelled seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That was accomplished through the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, it is necessary for everything to be known in the field of midwifery.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to something like that: therefore, place it against what is needed with the former one.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	The extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Head LVII.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are treating a dead fetus with what I have said about division from the medicine, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with your hands, then you should consider this.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and she is not mixed with any from the accidents by which there fears loss upon her: then it must be that the woman is laid on a bed, on her back, and her head is leaned downwards, and her legs are raised: and the attendant should hold her from two sides or bind her to the bed so that her body does not be pulled out when extracting the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the maternal mouth with oily liquids along with mucus of high alder and fenugreek, and linseed seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then, the midwife should lubricate her hand with these oils and mucus substances: then, she should introduce herself into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should search for the place where the hooks of the fetus are located, and find a suitable location for this purpose.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, consider this then, if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or around its neck, or into its mouth, or onto the palate itself, or under its chin, or in the throat, or near the ribs, and under the pubis.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If the descent is over its feet, then into the metatarsal region and mid-back of it.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it must be that she holds the hook with her right hand: and she will curve its position into what is between the left hand's fingers: and she should introduce herself with ease using this hand, and fix the hook in one of the locations we mentioned until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then place another hook opposite it, or a third if needed: so that there is an equal constriction and does not lean towards any side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then extend it with equal length, and do not make the extension according to straightness only; rather move it in all directions so that the flow is relieved: as happens when teeth are extracted during their removal.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it must be softening of the extension that lies between them.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a portion is retained from it, then the midwife must anoint certain fingers with oil and introduce them in that part, so as to rotate along with them what is being retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	So if the part of the fetus comes out, then swap the hooks to a higher place: do this until the whole fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	So if the hand comes out before the rest and it's not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then a cloth should be rotated over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until when it comes out completely, cut it either at the heel joint or at the elbow: and thus you should do this in the other hand, and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the fetus's head is large, or if it experiences constriction during birth, or if there is water collected in its head: then one should insert between their fingers a prickly sponge and find its way with it to remove the head, and extract the water. Or break it with the tool called Almisdac: which has the same shape as the other tools mentioned in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus has the nature of a large head, then you should take out the algengematu: or extract it with the misdach as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head escapes and is constrained at the gullet, then it should be pulled until moisture begins to flow from the chest.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it is not complicated and does not yield to an exit: then cut the head off promptly, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If it is below the belly and there is distension or water retention: then you must puncture it until moisture begins to flow from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above its own feet, then pulling it becomes easy, and its direction towards the birth canal is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constrained at the belly or chest: then you must extract it with the cloth that you had wrapped around your hand: and pull the belly or chest until what is inside them begins to flow.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the rest of the limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	But if the opening of the birth canal is open, then she should insert her hand to a depth inside the womb and find it with that which is grasping the head, and pull it with her fingers up to the opening of the womb: then she should insert one hook or two hooks into it and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	But if the opening of the womb is constrained because of a hot distension that occurs to it: then one should not exert effort on it, rather it is necessary to administer the flow of wet substances, abundant ones: and apply ointments: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	But if the fetus is above its own side, then it can be equalized: then administer what we said about a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do that, then proceed immediately with incision, and extract.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you must ensure that nothing is left of the scab inside entirely.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	So when you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot discharges which occur during pregnancies.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If blood discharge occurs, then submerge it in止血 waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed, I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; subsequently she became pregnant with another, and then even a second fetus died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Thus, after a long time, she developed an abscess at her navel which swelled up until it opened, and then began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore summoned to treat her, and I treated her for a long period of time; yet the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	So I placed over it some strong poultices for suction, and an opening emerged from the site.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed, and another opening emerged from her.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore amazed at this, for there is no hole in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I wondered, because they were from the bones of dead fetuses.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I examined the wound, and extracted many bones from it while she was in better positions during labor: and had survived for such a long time, and now discharges only a small amount of pus.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not include this extraordinary fact here, except because it contains knowledge, and serves as assistance for what the skilled surgeon doctor does with his hands during treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Below is the form of the Cephalus (a tool used for childbirth assistance), with which the bars are adjusted, having two spiral windings on both ends of two rods.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Vortex (another tool used in childbirth) must be finer than the Cephalus: and for it to become such, either use ebony or wood from a wild olive tree.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of all the wood be like two fingers: and the rim of each is like one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two rods are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been firmly attached on both sides; whose length is half a palm plus a little bit more: and the width of each is like two fingers, or slightly more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the maternal opening, so that it opens when you turn both Vortices.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Vortex which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood or wild olive wood, according to the shape of pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	But nevertheless, at its end there should be two additions as you see above: and the length of all these additions is about a palm; and the width of both is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	So when you want to open the womb with it, then have her sit on the bed with her legs hanging down, with what is between her thighs being open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two combined additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the tool between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the tool, as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount of force from the opening of the uterine canal until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of vertigo, as the ancients described it, is the form that pushes, by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which the large head is pressed: and it is similar to forcipae, which have teeth at the end, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes oblong, like the forcipae according to this form, as you can see, which have teeth like saw teeth, by which it is struck and pressed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which the small head is pressed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of someone holding one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of someone holding two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of the forceps which have teeth like saws, with which the head of the fetus is pressed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatumilis having two ends for removing the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatumilium, even those that are cumbersome.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more varieties of them exist, and those prepared by the craftsman, they either perform their tasks more quickly or appear more esteemed among people due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not overlook any of these instruments that have been prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	The need for them is undeniable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Section on the Extraction of the Second Stage.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When retention of the Secondina occurs during labor, then it is necessary to quickly instruct the weak one so she retains her breathing.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze while you're touching her: and place your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If she then comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot and puncture in the cover an opening: and put inside it opening herbs of the mother's mouth, like a reed, rue, and nettle, and chamomile, and dittany, and cinnamon wood, and centaurium: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a bundle of rushes over the opening of the pot, and the other end in the mother's mouth: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	Indeed, the Secondina will come out easily with facilitation.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in safflower oil, or in elderberry juice.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert it into the uterus and seek for the Secondina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she then finds it, take it and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deep within the womb, then insert her hand as we have described, until she finds the Secondina, and extract it gradually according to its direction, so as not to fall the womb due to intense suction. Indeed, it must be alternated with facilitation towards the right and left sides: then add in the amount of suction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For then she obeys, and is served, and freed from adhering.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already told you: care for it with a sneeze, and from the decoction of the pot along with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out as we have described, then beware that you do not tire yourself with repetition of the removal process.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	However, it is necessary that what comes out from inside to the mouth of the womb, be tied to the woman's hip bone.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then treat her with a tetrapharmaceutical ointment enema.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	Indeed, it will cause her to decompose after a day, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it decomposes, an unpleasant smell rises to the stomach and head, and this harms her.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, proper fumigations should be administered to counteract that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the old experts already knew how to perform fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the device used for fumigating a woman during retention of Sanguineae and menses is as follows.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make it like a small trumpet or from wood; and place the broad end over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed above the prunes: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	For the treatment of uninjured Ass (or an animal denoted as 'Ani' in this context).
Caput LXXIX.	Title 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born, and their asses (a term used metaphorically here referring to certain medical conditions of the newborn) are not injured, which have already been treated subtly by a needle.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife pierce this sack with her finger: and if not, she will pierce it together with a sharp awl. And let her beware of the cleft, so as not to touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place wool that has been soaked in wine and oil on top of it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then attend to it with the application of ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you fear that it will rupture, then place a long lead pipe in the hole for many days. And when the child wants to defecate, remove it.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now, Ani's suppuration also occurs from the healing of wounds or by emollients.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it must be cut that consolidation, then take care of it with what we said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Section on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Title 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower region are: Nodule, and Grossness happening near the anus of the defecation organ: or in a space of one part: and there is one fistula, or multiple.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that nodule shrivels up, it is opened, and moisture or thin pus runs out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas have penetrating ones.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out during defecation and wind when the patient is experiencing defecation. And perhaps something can come out of them like worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas when they are in the space penetrating up to the bladder and up to the bowel.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And there are penetrating fistulas that go up to the joint of the thigh and even up to the tail's node.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this point, how to recognize that a fistula penetrates up to the anus, even from one that doesn't penetrate, is as follows: insert your index finger into the anus. And introduce a delicate probe through air or iron into the fistula; when there's no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is curvature within it, then insert a delicate probe made of lead or a needle from the mane hairs until you feel the probe, or the needle inside your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, and nothing comes out of the hole from digestion, nor any wind or worm as I said: then you will know that it is not penetrating. Therefore, proceed with treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating up to a blister or the bladder of urine, then its indication is that urine exits from there and obstruction of it should be stopped so that the place may heal with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If however it is penetrating up to the joint of the thigh or the mouth of the thigh, then its indication is that a probe will reach there if there's no curvature until the mouth and any pain can be felt around the part, and pus always comes out from there, and no medicine nor ointment can heal it.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all such penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure: and the treatment of them is labor and futility, to those foolish physicians, who are formed upon this.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In this case however which is not penetrating and not old, there is a hope for healing with serro: according to what I am telling you, and I have already proven it. And it happens that the sick person lies on his back between your hands, and lifts his legs up to above his hips, and his thighs are bent towards his abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a lead or air pipe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the trial has gone.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel that the tent has already been penetrated through itself which was detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and it, or flesh: then indeed you will know for certain, because it is penetrating. Do not labor in her, as we said, since there is no healing for it.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They however say that flesh and in those who are healed by medication which is expected to bring benefit, is to use a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula as previously described, and insert the burning instrument into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this process two or three times until you know that all the added flesh, which is like bird feathers, has been sufficiently heated.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for this with the wrapped licorice in butter until these heated flesh pieces come out: then care for this with ointments that generate flesh and strengthen it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be cured with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the tent emerges and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick skin or flesh between it and the tent, or if you see a layer of flesh: then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and when you cut along with the tent within the fistula until the cut reaches where the tent's tip has reached, then remove the tent and it falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those flesh tissues that resemble bird feathers, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If the blood prevails and separates between you and your operation, then remove those flesh tissues. Then it is better and swifter to cauterize that with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the combination of cauterization with fire brings good effects, adding the searing of those flesh tissues, and the removal of blood, and drying out moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then take care of that with the enclosed lint in butter or ground waxes until the spot releases pus and those seared tissues come out in pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then take care of the wound with gels that consolidate, promoting hard flesh. There are medicines which have coagulation and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they heal, then it is truly healed: and you do not experience repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus and stretches due to excess of body matter: then insert your finger into the anus, and probe with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If indeed you feel it penetrates, and there is a covering between you, and that object, whether skin or flesh, and it's close to penetration: then there is no operation within that space, unless according to the path of faith and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	This is because it receives one of the three methods: or you cauterize it, as we said; or you remove it until you find its concavity, so that it's possible for you to insert lint and achieve healing from nearness.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the cut, so as to not enter into a channel containing the anus, and happen upon an unintended outcome of weakness in excretion without desire.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then proceed with that which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or you may lengthen the skin itself, and cleanse it after cutting it up to almost the anus, as we have said, or when tried, or with an instrument of another sharp end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those dissected flesh parts which are found in the section as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try the restoration of all wounds with the entire section and at the top opening where it consolidates: and there will remain an open fistula within the anal part, and it will be easier on the sick person.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sewn according to this method: and it is when you insert the test in the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the body surface with skin and edge of the anus: then take the test perforated at its end, which is like a needle aleskef, that is, prepared strips, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert the yarn wound from five threads into it, and about that area.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the test with thread into the fistula until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the edge of the anus internally nearby, then withdraw the thread from that hole: so as to insert your finger in the anus and take out the end of the thread, and bring together both ends at once: and tie both tightly, and let them go on one or two days: and the more thread goes into the flesh, tie it well until those parts are between the two ends of the thread and fall down: then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in any way that is prepared for you, unless it be deeply so.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For indeed, it is not for you to do that for a lizard's sake, so as not to hit it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	And then proceed with her as we said until she is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the needle-like spur through which a fistula flows, whose remedy is very acute on one part and the other part is not so, so as not to hit that which is not necessary, just as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Section on Suturing Hemorrhoids from which blood flows out of the cut in them: and treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Title 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are two ways of having hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or indeed they exist within the anus, resembling blisters or pieces of coal, or like pebbles: or as if they were grains of sand.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from these there are pairs and large ones: and blood flows out of them always, and it is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they exist outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are mostly of little moisture, from which a yellowish water or a slight continuous flow of blood comes out: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment for those inside the anus is to advise the sick person to sit in water: and squeeze until you see your own stool coming out, and the wounds will appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, hang them with hooks therefore: or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If however they are not held by them in them due to their moisture and softness themselves: then catch them with a coarse cloth or with the end of a double thread, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and after making certain cuts dust them with some warm powders so that they will stay in the place of the cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what precedes in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they recover.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	And if the anus does not yield to expulsion, then treat the patient with a small-pored enema, such that it will carry away what is inside the anus and allow for quick expulsion when the patient starts expelling.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	And if the athletes (referring to tumors or growths) are extrinsic to the anus, then their condition is easy and mild: it is possible for you to catch them with your finger, or with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them as we have said until they recover.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if someone is repulsed by the operation of cutting with iron, then you should treat them using their stitching method in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the thread that has been wound up, and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the athlete outwards to a higher position, and make it penetrate with its tip at the base of the root from another part. And wind the two ends of the thread on the lower part of the needle, making them cross each other in a transverse manner: and tightly tie the athlete by this constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then make knots in the thread and pull out the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the athletes and let out one from them: do not leave him as he is, in order to prevent excess bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or camphor over the anus, and put it over the anus. And instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let him down until he falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	And when the athletes fall, take care of them with ointments, and all other treatments, until they recover.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	¶ On the Care of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For it often happens due to the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	And when they are dried up, and no medicine is beneficial to them: then it is necessary to use blades with holes or your own nail until they become moist and the outer layer that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them until they consolidate according to what is needed.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	And if they do not consolidate: then treat them repeatedly with a more intense reason than the first, until they bleed much and are scraped off, then take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	¶ On the Care of Almimir's inverted operations, and not inverted ones: and Athelil's dry operations, and Ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Title 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almimir is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, particularly in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and pain occurs from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it must be cut where there is the head of the nail, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if it is necessary to cauterize that according to what has preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From Athelil's dry ones, one is a small elevated spot, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often happenings occur in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And the treatment for this is to spread the thistle and cut it; or tie it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if it's a thistle (Athelil), cauterize it according to what has been prescribed with fire or with an acute medicine; and now inverted thistles are eradicated both with the tool that I say, whether turned over or not.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	And the ant is also a small prominent entity that is filtered out, large in size, spread over the surface of the body, penetrating deeply. And when it finds coldness, it is felt like an ant bite within, throughout the body: and much of it occurs in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	The treatment for this is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong turkey feather and place that tube over the ant until it contains a circle of parts of its body within the tube.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then rotate your hand with the tube until you remove what is within the circle around the ant. Then place it deeply into the flesh and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if need be, do this with an air or iron tube according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Place the tube of the cannula upwards to its narrowest part, so that it rolls back over the finger and its own reversal.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what has been prescribed for cauterizing thistles in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Chapter: On the forms of instruments used for enemas in digestive ailments, and relief of the stomach, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When enema is made from silver, or from alloyed gold, or from blown or hammered air.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And at other times it is made from these tools in small and large amounts, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So that which is administered for the treatment of children with low weight, be it small: and whose anus are weak or painful, similarly, enemas of them.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tip of it, that is, the upper part where the womb is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and there must be a distinction so that the womb can be tied as you see fit. And the lower end which enters the anus, should be closed, meaning not open, soft, very much, pulling towards thinness: and on one side of it are two holes, and on the other side another hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the tubes, slightly thicker and less, and let there be a womb in which medicines are placed from an animal's bladder: or from the page of the stomach, which should have the shape of one half of a pear: whose root is a single palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced with many holes like a wheel has been rotated, and there should be space that is the thickness of a finger between each hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into the holes a strong thread made from raw fiber, which should be made from ten strands or roughly that amount, and bind it with the womb like an asphodel.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	And when the womb is placed inside it, tighten it at the head of the enema with a strong constriction between two distinguishing contractions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then perform an enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of a circle as depicted here, and of its holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the enema to be used in this case is as follows: fill the basin or the bag with medicine, which should be heated according to the tolerance level of the patient. And beware not to make it excessively hot or excessively cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is rolled onto his back, and his legs are raised to the upper side. And place under him an indenter, that is, skin where people lie down or a piece of cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then immerse the end of the enema with oil, or with tallow, or with mucus of fenugreek, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Next, insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then have the attendant grasp the basin with both hands simultaneously, and express it until he evacuates all that is inside the enema in the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the enema, and raise the patient's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine compels him towards evacuation, then hold as much as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it for the whole night, it is more beneficial at the end of treatment.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If the enema is administered while he is suffering from stomach discomforts and it speeds up his evacuation: then administer multiple enemas until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or injuries in the anus, then administer a subtle and gentle enema, using those enemas that are used for children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of the subtle enema over which tight skin is applied.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	For the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have spoken about the division of wound care in the book and said what was appropriate there. And I will say here how to care for them with hands and medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I therefore say that wounds are distinguished according to how they are formed and also according to the place upon which a wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	So the causes of wounds are many, such as being struck by a stone: or cut with a sword, knife, or scalpel; or hit through with a spear, wood, or arrow, and so on from various things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that occur according to the location of the body are such as a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, and so on from those parts.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I will be detailing the treatments for certain wounds, in order to establish this reasoning and guideline for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: since the recall of their compositions comes at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I therefore say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, then consider whether it was caused by being struck with a stone or something similar, and only the skin has been broken: this will result in a large wound and you should be wary of potentially serious outcomes using hot leeches. Then apply your attention, perform cephalic bloodletting immediately: and do not delay this step; extract from him according to the quantity of its effectiveness into the blood: if there is nothing preventing bleeding treatments, especially if only little blood is flowing out from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bloodletting be performed opposite the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of overfilling themselves, and of wine, and of large meals.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	And if something prohibits reduction, then reduce from food, and do not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if an abscess happens to him and there is pus, then place a hot poultice on it, made with an infusion in oil of roses or rose water, or with wine that has medicinal properties.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	And if you are sure about the hot pus and it is recent with his own blood and has not changed into air, then apply the powder I will tell you after a little while: and if it has already changed into air, then apply some ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	And if the wound is large, or comes from a cut made by scissors or similar tools: and if his lips do not come together with poultices, then join them with stitches, according to what I will tell you about stitching wounds of the abdomen.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	And if the wound has already been detected by bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Next, treat the wound with medicines, and restore the tough flesh to its place of skin, and instruct the sick person to eat foods that are rich in fat, such as heads and cooked grain, until they feel sated, and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find decomposition in the skin and it doesn't adhere to the bone, then cut out the decomposed part completely and remove it. Then treat that area.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	And if there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows: and if it cannot be cut through medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you find it not joined, then cut it with the lancet, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If need prompts when what we said does not hold up, then cauterize it until blood is released.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If the wounds are small and simple ones, then their treatment is easy and light; proceed like this by applying this powder to them. For it hardens them before they turn into pus.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of the poultice for flesh.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe: take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of ashes that have not been fully extinguished. Grind all together in much water and then sift it. Fill the wound with this mixture and apply a good bandage until it adheres well to the flesh and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind him from above with powders and release him, without breaking him as long as he remains, so that he does not loosen.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine will not be removed from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it makes this application only with the plaster, when you do not have olibanum and dragon's blood on hand. The same operation can be performed in many large wounds when it is necessary to place it over them and bind them together, and the wounds are recent with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If they have been altered by air in some way, especially when it is in the season of summer, then this powder's purpose is not in place: therefore take care with what we said, so that you put some cooked oils over them. Or place over them powders made from wheat flour mixed with water and honey until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If it happens that a bone fracture occurs in the bone and it is small, then extract that with the Gesti tool: and I have already explained the treatment for head fractures in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	¶ On Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Title 85: The Head
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If indeed a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however the neck nerve or artery has already been incised: then if it is a nerve, there is no faculty in it, unless treatment of it is made with what makes strong compression, such as zinnias, and zygomatics, and similar ones.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm nerves and cause their contraction.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything entirely cold on the wound: for the substance of nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that be used in its treatment from gentle medicines, such as lotus root soaked occasionally in sweet water or oil, or mixed with rose oil, and turmeric, when even it is washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, according to this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply stitches: or compress its edges with powders.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If the depth of the wound is great, or if it happens to be in a sinus in its lower part where pus has already accumulated, then puncture it at a more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has already been cut in the wound and there is a flow of its blood, then separate it, or dry it out, and tie that part. Or if necessity demands it, cauterize it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If it has already reached the throat, or the entire windpipe, and it is salvaged: then gather skin flaps together with suture over the larynx canal, and do not touch the windpipe, indeed make it level (with the surrounding tissue), and place it back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then suture it with an appropriate tension, and let it rest for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments that have healing and drying properties until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression in bone, then probe it. Then, if there are fragments of bone within it, extract all of them or what you can from them; and leave that which cannot be prepared until the wound putrefies and its exit is separated and cleaned.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then dust it with the powder I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it seems that there is an opening in the wound, and a fistula forms, then care for this as described in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Chapter on Wound In Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	Title 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If you detect the impact of a spear or a knife, and see its depth, then assess it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If then there is breath coming out of the wound when a sick person inhales from it, you will know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if there is no depth to it and it is fresh with its own blood: then do not put the powder in immediately at first hour, nor bind it, lest blood be retained within the depths of it and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person. Instead apply a drawing ointment into it and let him be relieved twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If the desired ointment is not available to you, then place a used cloth in the wound's opening, so that it will absorb what comes out of him from the moisture: and have done such that the sick person sleeps over the wound, so that what collects within it may heal.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If three days have passed or more since the wound and no illness, no bad heart tremor, and no constriction during breathing occur, and you see all other its conditions are good, then you know that the wound is healing.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, take care of it yourself and follow with medications, and all other treatments, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If the wound's healing is delayed and constantly opens, then you will know that a fistula has already been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, take care of it according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a scalpincision, or of a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then take care of it with whatever preceded it in stitches, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	And if it has already made an impression in the bone and is coming out from there fragments: then examine the wound, and proceed to remove those fragments if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If the fragments are not separated, then leave them until the wound decays, because their extraction is often harmful.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	As for other accidents of wounds on the remaining limbs, judgment in treatment is as we have said about his judgment.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	¶ On Wounds of the Abdomen, and the Egress of Intestines, and their Discharge.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that happens in the stomach is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, from the great ones, sometimes the intestines come out, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Thus, there is an intrusion and stitching of them, and their stitches are more severe and harder.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even small disruption also happens to be difficult due to another method.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction becomes more difficult if you do not promptly reintroduce them to their place: because they inflate, open, and thicken; which is why their introduction becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, this leads to a better disruption of the medium type: because when this does not occur, there is an easier reduction of the intestine, unlike the more difficult situation in the other two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that sewing of veins follows four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common stitches are applicable to the surgical closure of the abdomen and other body wounds; and two other specific stitches are meant for closure of other types of injuries.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more specifically suited for the surgical closure of the abdomen, and I will tell you each one with its description.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and something of the intestine comes out from it, making its return difficult: then this corresponds to one of the two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or due to the severity of the surgery as we said, or because of inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When that is the case, then you should warm it up so much that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with ginger, rue, and the root of garlic, and warm it up with that inside the intestine until the inflammation resolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	At times he does this with one thing where there is a ligature: and it is better than water alone in the dissipation of inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	So when you see that the inflammation has already dissipated, then moisten the intestines with water that has been boiled with dock or flax.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through this, its entry is alleviated when something small is present.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however there remains no return of its discharge after this treatment, then use a little in the dissection, using the tool with which the hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when prepared than cutting: and there is no forced action to cut after necessity and deficiency of the tool.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let there be a part of it that is twisted, sharp, and another part of it not sharp, and the end should not be as thin as Spatumilis, rather it should be more obtuse somewhat: and this one that resembles a nail, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	So when the ulcer expands and enters the intestine, then it must have a reduction according to its natural form at its own place if possible over that: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	But when the dissection is broad at the lower part of the belly: then it must have you make the patient lie on its back and place its legs higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head and the side of its body higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if the dissection is within one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intent and consideration always in this way, that part where the ulcer is be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it should be that you apply this to large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In wounds that are clean, apply according to what you have prepared for yourself.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then let there be a devout and trustworthy attendant between your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and unite his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then take from that, for the one following during suturing, something after something: and this is the common method of suturing for one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take the needle, or according to the number of needles according to the size of the wounds.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then remove from the edge of the rupture the width of a finger, that is, the measure for doctors: and place one needle over the thread you are going to introduce into it in both ends of the skin, with two ends of the suture under the skin from inside, until you make it penetrate from another part. And now you have joined the two ends of the skin, and two ends of the suture: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with double thread around the tip of the needle several times from both sides at once, until the two edges of the wound have been joined in an appropriate manner.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then remove the thickness of a finger as well, and fasten another needle in them: then baste it with thread like you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore, do not stop doing that with each one from the needles until you complete the suturing of all the wounds.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needle be medium between thickness and fineness: for fine needles very quickly puncture the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin: it is necessary therefore that they should be of medium fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary for the needle to be placed very close in both ends of neighboring skin parts: so as not to pierce the flesh too quickly and open the wound before its healing, and also not to stretch them even during suturing, so that the wound may not be prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the knives so they do not hurt the patient during sleep. And place small pieces of cloth from all sides on them which hold the ends of the knives, and release them until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed, this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because in their suturing, one or two needles suffice, or roughly that many.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second method of suturing is common, where you join together at four points: the ends of the skin, and two ends are sutured against each other with one needle, on which there is a thread wrapped when it was rolled out, equal in thickness and size.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have passed the four ends with the needle from where you started, pull the needle back to that part, so that the thread pulled from the upper part of the wound falls: it should be like a sewing stitch as when clothes are sewn together, and place throughout every suture a quantity of thickness equal to that of a smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitching is known by people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch, I treated the wound that happened to a man, which had been cut by a knife and there was a larger tear than one hand's width: and two hand's lengths came out from his intestines from the middle intestine, and it was a tear in the center of his abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So I returned that after twenty-four hours when his intestine was outside the wound.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound therefore healed over the space of about fifteen days: and I cared for him and he recovered: and after that he lived many years, changed in his ways.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat that with the ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, and I had nothing else from remedies.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	So I put it on the wound with an old butter twice a day, and did thorough washing with honey water until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two kinds of suture methods according to the language used.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is like this when you start with a sharp suture: and you insert the tip from the outside towards the inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	So when the needle has penetrated into the skin and gone through the wound according to the length and width of the whole body: cut off the end of it, place it on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from the inner part at one end to the outer part at the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	So when you have made it penetrate like this at the same end, then make it penetrate according to this from that side towards the inside: and cut off the other end which is on this side, and make it penetrate into the other end from the inside at the outer part: and make it penetrate with the penetration that you are making it penetrate at that end, which is in its part, until it penetrates all of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then start again from this same side, and pull out the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then guide her back into that skin, and pull out the other end which is on the other side from this end at the wound: and pull it out of the skin which comes from its part, and do it in reverse order with one thing first, then another: and do it like this in succession until you have pulled out all of them according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	The essence of this sewing technique is to utilize the skin sheets as stitches which are akin to the skin sheets themselves. So arrange such that you fold one edge of the sheet opposite another edge from a single layer of skin and proceed in a manner where you alternate lifting each end from one side then the other, until completion.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture method, as mentioned by Gale努s.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This method of speaking describes how to handle the technique according to its likeness, like certain doctors do. It involves assembling all parts in harmony with their natural fit and applying one end of it against another part's end and then applying from the other side against that same part.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done according to what I am telling you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must place the needle at a point near your own end from the outer part and make it penetrate into the inner side only there. Then release both ends of it.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outer part into the inner side at both ends, that is, on each side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both needles, and make each of them penetrate from the inner side to the outer one up until the opposite lateral sides, which are on the other side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of sewing is a better common suture and it is the suture that precedes the recall.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This, therefore, is the discourse of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some people said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The abdominal suture is corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	What you do is introduce one thread into each of them: and start when inserting the needle from what is with you, and make it penetrate up to the other side, according to their suture which are like leather.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly: then the suturing of it is more difficult than the rest of the belly areas.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of treatment for wounds is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	This is because when you apply a fresh wound with its own blood before it dries and you return the intestine to its place and everything else properly, then place it on top of the powdered flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	And if the air has already changed the wound: then put some ointments over it which are available to you until pus forms and the threads fall out and heal and improve.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as you would for other wounds until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	And if no medicines are available to you, then immediately place on it a poultice until pus begins to come out, using an old one and change it twice a day as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicines when the wounds are simple in various dispositions.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	And if you fear that the wound communicates with the main limbs in injury, then it must be dipped in wool that has been tempered to a moderate heat or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the thighs and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	And if it feels pain, or perforations, or putrefaction in its intestines (which happens frequently), then irrigate it with a wine that is stoptic, black and warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached inside the intestine and made an incision penetrating to the cavity of it.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that which comes from the larger intestine is easier to heal, and what comes from it that is finer has a more difficult healing process.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, as regards that part of the intestine which is called the jejunum, it does not receive healing from wounds that happen within it at all: and this is due to its multitude being veins, and the size of them, and because of its thinness, and proximity of itself to nerve nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	However, if that which proceeds from the wound is hair, and you recognize it as fresh: apply the treatment in accordance with your method of treatment, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the time has passed for it and it has already become green or black: then you must bind it with a thread at the place that was discolored by it, in order that no blood flow occurs.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For hair contains veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut the ligament that follows beyond this one, and place two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside it. So that when pulled upwards, it assists in the attraction above you, and extraction at the case of hair, and discharge from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Recollection of what happens to wounds that occur in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a disruption in the Intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for some individuals to recover. Thus, I saw someone who was wounded in their abdomen with a lance strike, and there was a wound on the right side of the stomach, and it was an old wound: and a fistula was made, and excrement emerged from it along with flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I provided treatment until I was satisfied with his recovery and did not cease to refine the treatment until he was healed and the wound site had consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the wound site had consolidated, I feared for the sick person, fearing that a bad incident might happen to them in their abdomen: and no bad incidents occurred from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in his better conditions, eating and drinking, defecating, and entered the bathhouse, and exercised himself in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied according to this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And there is one thing you might find interesting: antlers of great beasts.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Next, gather two lips of the wound and place one ant (formica) each from those that have an open mouth on the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	And when it grasps them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with the ant after the ant according to the quantity of the wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	And then return it (the limb or animal) back and allow its wound to heal.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For the heads remain attached in the intestine until it has been fed and healed within its intestines, and no harm will occur to the sick person entirely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to sew the intestine even with a fine thread: which is removed from the animal's intestine, attached to it after being inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you should take this end of the thread from the intestine and remove much flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the fine, withdrawn linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	And then insert that thread into the needle, and sew it with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	And then return it to the disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and the intestine is nothing other than according to the path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You should know that a wound which is large and broad, especially if it's located on one of the slender intestines: then there isn't any skill except for fine sewing, and its cure is not complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	The Care of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that any wound, or pustule when it hardens and ages, and becomes a溃疡 (ulcer), and does not heal up solidly, and always emits pus, and cannot be separated: then it is called universally in any part of the body, a Fistula, and we call this particular one Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And indeed, a Fistula is according to truth a filtered formation, hard, white: when there is no pain with it, but it has the shape of a bird's feather. And because of that, some call it Risati, meaning the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And there are times when they become wet and emit pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the wetness splits at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And this moisture can be much or little, it can be thick and can also be fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already hinted at this division previously, when I said that every wound which does not heal, and is not born within the flesh, is due to only one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Among these causes, one is due to the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of malice towards it: or because there is hard flesh between itself and its opening which impedes birth of tissue: or because of much dirt and disease: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and what is sent to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine used for its cure is inconvenient: or because corruption falls as a kind of plague in certain areas, as happens in Caesaraugusta where digestion of maladies is difficult and healing of pustules is delayed by nature: or because there is one opening, or multiple bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown you all these causes and signs of them, and the treatments for them with medicines, in division: it is necessary here that you should know the treatment of Fistula and Zukeen which happens through a way of operation with hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, you should know that Fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	Therefore, there are Fistulas which extend to the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or to the intestines, or bladder, or any of them from the ribs: or from one of the back bones, or any compound joints composition: such as hand, and foot: and among these are those that lead to proximity to the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, among these Fistulas follows this manner: they originate from illnesses that are difficult to treat and do not receive healing. When one tries to attend to them, it is a task of labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach the places that I said, and you hope and trust in its treatment, trying to know about it, then take something made of air or iron if the Fistula runs straight, and investigate with it along with yourself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If there is a twistiness in the Fistula, then investigate it with a fine lead tool.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead, due to its own body's softness, is softened and bent around the twistiness.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to describe it with the tool.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cleanse from them by using a catheter through their openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you cleanse it, directs itself towards other openings and flows out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully inquire according to the way it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a mouth or a nerve there, and whether it is a long or close fistula; or is there one fistula with many openings that stays over all that area with your greatest effort. When questioning the patient and finding pain upon pressing your hand on the spot, and through similar symptoms and causes of accidents, you should assess it.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	And when you stand on that true position, then go to the treatment according to confidence: and it is for you to consider at this point whether there appears a close fistula, or in a location save far from the connection, or near to a nerve, an artery, a vein, or one of those places which I told you about. Then cut off the fistula according to what was instructed from my description, and remove what is within it by filtration, and decomposed tissues that are born inside its mouth from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	And if the fistula is deep and according to the direction: then it must be cut out as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse that from all its decomposed flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Next administer licorice that has been wrapped up in medicines for acute conditions: and insert it until you reach the concavity of the fistula that you comprehended with iron. Do this repeatedly with it, until the whole remaining in the concavity of the fistula from decomposition is corroded by the acute medicine.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore that with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	And if it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have instructed.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	And if the cause of the fistula is a mouth and it has been confirmed to you as such: then inquire about it and cut it according to what I have instructed you: if nothing prevents you from something in vein, or nerve, or main member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore you find an opening (in the wound), and there is some corruption, and blackness: then shave it until all of its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it together with that which grows back, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	And if it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before: then you will know that you have not fully eradicated the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, shave over that second time, and carefully consider its condition, and the cleanliness of it with your final strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it heals, that is good; and if not, then you will know that that corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you do not have the skill in such matters, except for to remove what nature provides.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	And if the infected mouth is small and it's possible for you, draw it with fine hooks that are suitable for this.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	And if there are many bones, then carefully make the removal of all of them, and do not remove anything from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	And if something disagrees with you from the humids, and there is no fear or mistake in the cuts, then cut those humids and flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	And if however you do not have preparation for removing bones at your time, then place on the wound what will rot it: and remove it until whatever has decomposed from around those bones from flesh and humids has decayed.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And watch over the wound so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tighten the section you cut during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Place it on top of it, if you can, the hand immersed in ground-sulfur mixed with oil: or the hand immersed in Egyptian ointment, or some green of ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when these moist substances decay and separate from them the bones, it facilitates their removal and the attraction of [the health] towards it.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if there is a large mouth, as in the case of the leg hole or hip hole and similar structures, and what has decayed out of it is a large part; then shave it with logic until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then heal the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is inside of it has decayed and become a large part, and decay has already reached the bone, then it becomes necessary to cut through it completely until the point where decay arrived. Then take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you about what happens to the leg during surgery: so that you can use this as an example and a guide for your own procedure.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man around thirty years old who experienced pain in his leg. The cause of this pain originated within him inside the body, that is from the internal parts, until the materials reached the knee and swelling occurred - and there was great swelling. There was no external cause for this.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So the time has been prolonged with their mistakes until the pustule is opened and a great amount of matter comes out.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after the treatment until the ulcer heals and many openings are made in it; all these were emitting pus and bodily moisture.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	He was treated by many doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine until I was called upon and saw his knee and what flowed out from those large openings - even his whole body had shrunk and his skin was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, an attempt is made for an introduction within one of the places of the openings, and the probe has reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I thoroughly examined all openings, and found that they reach each other from all parts of the limb.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	So I proceeded, and followed along one of these openings until I found a part of the bone: and I discovered that it was decayed. It had become corroded, degraded, putrid, and perforated, until it reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	So I sharpened what was found to me, and prepared from the decayed bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I placed it, for that was not within the bone except that decay, which I had to scrape and sharpen.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I have already removed that [decayed part].
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then, I placed the restoration with medicinal consolidating substances over the wounds for an extended period of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it has not been consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried it and found a second opening above the first detection; and I discovered continuous decay with the bone: and I sharpened what was revealed to me even from that decay.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then, I attempted to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it has not been restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I then discovered it again, and did not cease to penetrate the mouth finely, and attempt to restore it: and it was not restored until I reached about a palm from the bone, and extracted it together with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed. This repetition of the procedure during his operation and sectioning was not necessary, except due to the debilitation of the sick person, and their limited tolerance, and my fear for him regarding death: because he experienced sickness from over-inducement of evacuation at all times due to excess.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	The treatment has resulted in a complete healing: and the thing that is born is flesh tough at the site of the bone, and good arrangement was made in its body, and returned his strength to him: and he was turned back into his positions: and it did not cause him any harm or injury during walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If indeed the projecting bone in the body is already broken: then it must be done as this method: and thus: take the ligament, and bind it at the end of the projecting bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and place another thicker thread of wool for a second ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh which is at this bone: and extend its end so that you can take flesh downwards: and you lay flesh over the place where you want to saw, making sure not to cut the flesh with the saw.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood or a plank under the bone below: because when you do this, it does not prevent that rotten flesh will be cut.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it must be that the saw is above the place of decayed flesh slightly, so as not to be in the hollow of the corrupted bone: and it should not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compel by means of her own sawing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and it is not projecting, rather continue a part of it with its part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in part of it: then take flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw that from the first part where there is corruption, until you continue the sawing from the other part: and make the sawing according to the length near the corruption as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut that corrupted joinery, and saw through the bone where it continues from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If corruption is within the continuity of two joints, then there is no ingenuity except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is within the wrist or the ankle joint, then it's very difficult to resolve that issue.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	However, you must inquire as to how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And remove the abrasion, and cleanse it according to any possible arrangement for you, and correct it with whatever ingenuity you can muster: when it does not oppose your efforts, whether by vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you will know that the incisive saw and the serrated tool are useful for these bones in many ways, depending on their location, preparation, thickness, fineness, size, quality, rarity of the bones themselves, and their hardness.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Hence, it is necessary to prepare the tool suitable for each type of operation for that task.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you should know that these operations indicate to you the type of tool you need for them when your study extends to length.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is evidence of the severity of its methods. Then, you will find for yourself what suits it from tools to all ailments.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am steadfast with you at the end of this chapter on the number of tools, which you place as examples upon which you incise and test through experience upon others.
Forma Serrae.	Shape of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of the other saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of the other (additional) saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of the additional saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depicted shape of the saw, let it be centered.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper part be an arch, its sharpness made of iron: and its handle out of wood, and let it be pyramidal with a center of gravity off-center.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of the joint razor.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor have the shape of a star-shaped clavus (a type of nail). And let its points be like those of an elishabet (a specific kind or style of point).
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable unless they grind with it the heads of sutures when they are corrupted, or an extensive and large mouth, and a large size is needed.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor that has a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The form of another (type of) sharp razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The form of another razor with curved ends.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the leaf-like razor, finely-pointed testa.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also, the form of the large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a sawblade: it is exhibited in many places according to the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that suits the reason for its perforation from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, and the ends are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it must be that all things which we have said about razors, cutters, and saws should be done.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On incisions of extremities and the fixing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Title LVIII.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities decay, either due to an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	So when you have treated that decay with medical remedies, and the treatment does not apply: and you see the decay affecting the limb without anything touching it, then it is necessary to make an incision into that limb up until where the decay follows, so that the sick may be saved through this way from death, or from a malady which surpasses the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign when this happens is that the member deteriorates until we think it should be destroyed: like how fire burns itself or turns black before it rots. Until an incision reaches that rot up to what follows that limb and gnaws through the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	So then, after making this incision and similarly if the cause of the decay is due to some venomous creatures: like the sea scorpion, snakes, adders, and similar.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	So if the decay or impact is at the extremity of a finger, then you must cut off the finger and not leave space for the decay to spread until it reaches the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens to the hand, then you must cut it off from the root of the wrist bone and not leave space for the decay until it reaches the brachial part of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades there, then cut off the upper arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however, the decay passes and you see it around the elbow: then there is death for the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And administering beyond this by way of treatment is the amount of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly for a foot, when corruption invades a finger, then it falls upon one node: and if it reaches to the heel of the foot, then the whole foot falls.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	And if it ascends to the knee, then it falls upon the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	And if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the afflicted to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of applying or gripping the limb is to bind or tighten it, such that you pull on the ligament below where you wish to apply it: and then grip another ligament above that spot.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the attendant extend one ligament downwards: and let the attendant extend another ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is revealed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then apply or tighten it.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And you must place lint over all parts and do not let the scalpel touch the healthy area. A wound added to the injury should occur, and a warm pustule should form.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	And if bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area: or place some blood-letting powders on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And then bind the injured limb with a suitable ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happens to his foot, this is the same event that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	And what happens is that a blackness occurs on his foot, which resembles burning due to the heat of fire: and this corruption initially happens in his finger until it began to affect the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	So the man treated himself after he saw decay enter into his member with the weakening of it, that he found from his pain and its heat. And he comes to surgery, and he is healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time has passed for him, the same decay befalls his index finger of his own hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	So he came to me and I tried to restore that excess with what I had placed on his hand from medicines after his body's purification: the excess did not return and began spreading to another finger; until decay started affecting his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called me to cut his hand: but I refused that, hoping for a reaction from me against the return of that excess: and I also feared death upon him at cutting into his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the strength of the man was above the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	So after he lost hope in me, he returned to his land: and news of him reached me, because it happened quickly, and he cut his entire hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not omit this account, except as an aid to understand that which falls under the type of this illness: and as an explanation that is understood, and according to how it is handled.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	¶ On the care for enemas, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Head 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in some fatty tissues, and the space of the abscess extends until it collects pus: then it bursts or is pierced, and what's inside comes out with pus, leaving a vacuum spot: and the skin above it behaves like a tissue that has already thinned out. It does not reach its ultimate stage of corruption, nor does it spread to the mouth, nor to the nerve, nor to the ligament: it deserves to be called an Enema. It is not called Fistula. However, if the space extends until it spreads into one of these tissues, then it becomes a Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is to penetrate that skin completely as it is unfolded: and especially when it has become thin like a cloth. And trust because it will not adhere to the place due to its decay.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	And if you hope that it will adhere to the skin and does not follow that final decay: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then take care with Clisteri: and it is for you to consider towards the Breast.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	And if it is large and the pus that issues from it has an odour of corruption: then treat with Clisteri using Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia, taking equal parts of them to mix into a pot. And they are cooked over fire until the medicine turns red. And it will thicken like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and treat the Breast with Clisteri using it. Tighten its opening, and pour the medicine into it to a quantity equivalent to two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then remove it with the discharge: do this for days until the Breast is cleansed and the smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is treated with water from ashes instead of this medicine when it's not available to you. And you should take the ash from vine wood or oak wood and pour that water on top of it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then let her rest with it, treating with this mixture until you are confident that the Breast has been cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	And if the weak cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or its water mixed with ashes, then treat it with water and honey that has already been mixed with some of crushed zinnia.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or treat it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the properties of honey that cleanse and clean; and wine makes the Breast adhere, especially when there is excess of coagulating and drying qualities in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you perform this procedure several times and believe that the sinus causing corruption has been removed, then after that irrigate him with whatever helps to create flesh within it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And here is how you take it from the plaster of dyafinicon: dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine, or irrigate it with various medicines and other ointments, about which I wrote their properties in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the sinus opening is narrow and does not allow the passage of a catheter during irrigation: then widen it with a small piece of iron. Or place a rolled licorice in an Egyptian ointment or a basil ointment inside it, until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the opening is even wider, then stitch together its edges with suture. And remove from it the amount that can be irrigated with a catheter without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated above the surface: then cut him open to a lower place within it, so that pus can drain from there down below. Because pus, when restricted deeply in the sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	And if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus close to below where you wish: then try to prepare the member with preparation that allows pus to drain out of it easily, according to how you are prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try so that nothing of the pus is retained within it at all. And take the consolidative medicines that are placed over the sign, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such quantity that it may facilitate communication throughout the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps through the direct opening of the sinus hole, widening it slightly into the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from unguentary ointments another patch onto the cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it upon it in a position far away from the sinus opening, so that the pus may be expelled through it: and do not remove the large patch unless after some days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That one who is over the sinus opening, that one you remove at all times, so that what accumulates in it from pus may go out. And to know whether that which flows out of it is much or little: or whether it has digested well or poorly.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And again, when this is done, consider the location of the sinus itself; does the owner feel pain there, or is there no pain within it, and is there a boil inside, or is there no boil.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	So when your treatment is applied like this, and you see the material that emerges over the sinus opening, then you will know that the sinus has adhered, or is approaching adherence: therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you open the wound, then change another bandage, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however pus emerges from the sinus over a long space subtly, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since there are humans who delay the growth of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to him.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however pus emerges from the sinus after many days that is undigested, then you will know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its process extends, then add to drying remedies but have the physicians do it such that they make the remedies in their substance wet and dry at the same time: like the dyafinicon ointment when a superfluity of addition is added from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from this final part of what he treats, it is to take the dyefinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, then let the old wine soak into its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with this [material], and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And similarly performs this action when the dyafinicon ointment is not at hand, using honey, when you decoct it until it thickens, and then uses it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and frankincense, and spikenard: grind it all together, and spread that powder on honey while it is still over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then pour it over this cloth, and tie it over the pot: and pour in the honey that you have decocted, until it has thickened: and spread the mixture on top of it, and put the cloth over it, then tie it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered with the long aristolochia and roots of the celestial lily, and the lily itself: and herb flour, and centaurie.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them either simply or combined, grind these and sift them: and spread the powdered mixture over the honey that I have described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition persists and is not healed by this treatment, then you will know that there is a deep corruption within him. Or it has already made an impression in the bones, or in other hard parts, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment for Fistular (conditions), as previously stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Section 1: Treatment of Abscess and Ingrown Nails, and Incision of the Finger, and Section.
Caput XCI.	Title XCIX.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	An abscess is an infection that occurs under the thumb nail of the hand or foot, and may also occur in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore its extension is prolonged, and its care is neglected, and it is treated with hot application: either it gets corrupted and discharges pus until the root of the nail rots away. And perhaps it corrupted all of it, and perhaps infection reached up to the mouth until there is a foul odor present. Then the end of the digit becomes broadened, and its color turns to dark brown.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When however you take care of it, when you have done what we said about division, and if you do not provide proper care: then it is necessary to use the iron completely on the remaining excess which was left from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Indeed, the cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the mouth is intact and there is still a nail even if it's somewhat damaged, and the empty spaces beneath the nail are already pressing into the flesh towards the insides, and they start piercing it, then you should place a delicate piece of iron under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh. Push it upwards gently. Cut off the flesh with ease, and then cover what's left of the flesh with substances used for burning and corroding until it is all removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If corruption has already spread into the mouth, then you should cut that mouth and remove it out. The mouth cannot ever be healed while there is a corrupted one remaining.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then cut it off at one of its joints, as was previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If it happens due to nail rubbing or impact and there is intermittent pain, then it should be treated with a weak bloodletting first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatulimi across from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful, so that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause a severe pain to happen upon the patient, and it will be the cause of the creation of the addition of flesh at that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then take care of the site with whatever soothes the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	But the added finger that is born in some human hands, perhaps it is entirely flesh. Perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it. And some of them are born at the junction's root or its birthplace may be in certain joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	That one which is born at the joints of some fingers does not move: and that one which is born near the junction of the finger may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the one among them that is flesh, its section is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which means, you will hit it at its root with the broad end of your spatulimi (a surgical tool).
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The treatment for that one whose birthplace is at the junction's root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, avoid making an incision on it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But for that one born at the end of the fingers among the joints, then you must make an incision to reach the first flesh up until the mouth of the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then squeeze the bone with one of those surgical tools that fits and aligns to it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	Recovery that happens between fingers one by one, happens many times either due to the birth of a person, that is, it is born with it, or from the healing of wounds, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for one to detach that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a licia (type of fabric) or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not adhere quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the affected area consolidates as required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if there happens to be a consolidation between some fingers and the palm, then detach that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suits the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ On Incisions.
Caput XCII.	Head 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Uterine veins are rolled, large, filled with superfluous melancholic matter which happens in many parts of the body. And most often their occurrences are in the legs, particularly in the walking and working legs, and those that bear weight.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, you should administer purges of the body from black bile, several times with strong purgation.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then use a bloodletting tool on the patient's basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	However, the treatment for them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of these methods involves drinking and extracting black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is to remove the vein and extract it entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it, however, follows this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First immerse the leg in warm water for quite some time until the thick and fatty blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then, bind the leg of the sick at the upper part of its thigh bone, up to the lower part of the knee with an appliance.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut one, or two, or three wide sections in the place.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, extract the blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg until to the upper part, and from the upper part it should be done by the phlebotome on the first place.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail down to the bone until a quantity of blood comes out that you see is sufficient and that the strength of the patient can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it up: and advise him to refrain from foods that generate bile black. And perform repeated evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and this harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The raising of such (a patient) is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse him in the bath: or soak his leg with hot water into it until he becomes red and the veins become prominent: or exercise him with vigorous exercise if there is no present bath until the member warms.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin directly across the vein section along its length: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks and remove the vein from all sides until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, you see that it turns from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	And when it flows out of the skin, you see it white as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the rod under it until when it rises and comes out of the skin: hang it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section close to that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the thigh until it becomes visible.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift her up with the tongs as you did before, and hang her up with another hook as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or more sections if needed for that purpose.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift it up and cut the final section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you extract it from the upper section or with all higher sections until when she is completely released. Then cut her off.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if she doesn't obey you to extract and lift her out, then insert the tip with a strong double thread and tie her. Then pull her out. Or insert the tongs underneath her and move your hand around until she comes out completely.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut too deeply.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if you do cut, it will greatly make it difficult for you to lift her out and she can cause harm to the vulnerable one from there.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	So when you have extracted her completely, then place on the wound site a cloth immersed in wine and rose oil or just oil, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If it is contracted with a twist that makes it difficult to straighten out and it's not as we described according to the straightness: then you must find above her across all parts of its twistiness, and the places of its turning.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang her up with hooks until you lift her completely. Be careful when your section is over her not to cut the vein or injure her; for it will be difficult for you to lift her or extract her afterwards.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, preserve your wisdom.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the injury by which the vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the noose for the blind.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	There is no such treatment for him as for others with nooses, nor does he have a sharp extremity to avoid piercing the vein; and it has a large bending, being soft. For if it were fine, it would pierce the blood vessel by its fineness. Indeed, there is an excess of thickness for him, just like we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the thigh vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is formed in the thighs in hot lands, such as Alizay, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot, little fertile lands, that is, in which no grass nor tree is born.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is formed in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Indeed, its formation is from putrefaction that happens under the skin, just like snakes and roundworms happen inside bodies, and worms that are born between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of events related to this vein is that inflammation happens in the thighs periodically.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then, a spot will blister.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistery spot, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	So when the end of it appears from there, then you should wrap some part of a lead weight over it, whose weight is equivalent to about half a shekel up to two shekels and mark that point. Then remove the suspended lead from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something issues out from it towards the external [body], envelop that with lead, and place a mark there.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends for a long time, then cut off its portion, and envelop the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it to its root before it has entirely come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it too deeply, it contracts and penetrates into the flesh: this causes pus to occur, and decay in the area, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it is necessary to handle it gently and extract it gradually until the very end of its root has come out, so that nothing remains from it within the body: through this vein, in some individuals there comes forth what is as long as five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, because it emerged from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	And if you happen to cut into it during your treatment time: then insert the root into its hole and make a long puncture through both parts of it, until all that is inside comes out from the substance: and apply decay to the area with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the treatment of the pus.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein often has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint or within the foot. And there are multiple openings for it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So care for this thing as we have said in division and along with that which was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Section of worms generated under the skin, and it is called Boil Sickness.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This sickness is called Boil Sickness in our land: because it often happens to cows, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is perceived by sense during his walking from member to member, until wherever it breaks, it breaks through the skin's place, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its production is from the putrefaction of certain body fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Like when worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and hookworms, occur in the stomach.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared due to its malevolence.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when it travels within the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place there: then perhaps it opens within it, emerges, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	So when you then attend to the wound and remove it, this does not happen except during his walking and its appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it must be that you tie what is above him and what is below with the bandage in a strong constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut over it, and pull it out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it goes deep into the flesh and you do not find it: then place a cautery on the spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And what is feared more, is its corruption which spoils the eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	And if you see that it has already penetrated to the head near the eye, then bind under it a good eyebrow constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut over it and pull it out.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary for me to use his sick purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad body fluids.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And beware of foods that cause putrefaction in oneself.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On Cutting for Sickness Relief by Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This sickness is called Nakir in our land: it is pain that happens to some limbs; then it changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have heard it myself, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was summoned to attend a woman who is ill in some respects.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And I extended her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after staying for an hour, I saw one swelling move along with rapidity, like a worm walking, ascending to her shoulder faster than it is possible: let it be as though silver is alive, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	So the pain withdrew from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her entire body, as I had observed.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed by the speed of its transition from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, I had not seen this sickness in such manner with my eyes before in this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many cases where the pain is found to change from limb to limb. And I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in this woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not consider that to be the case unless it is due to this, that woman was from those who have dry body veins detected. Hence, that sensation of wind changing seems to appear through the senses.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this manner in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, for hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	And therefore when you wish to treat him and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears to you visually, as we said, then grip above it, and beneath it quickly, and cut above it until that confined wind emerges: and cauterize the area.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your eyes: then attend to it along with the expulsion of the body, and what drives out the winds, and purge these with stinking pills, and pills from poppy, and similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their types and the locations where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	But their variety is as follows: because among them there are those that have large and small points, and cupped ones, and round ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are arrows that have three corners.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those with tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those that have star-like shapes.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which fall according to the limbs they hit are considered under two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or if the limbs are from the main limbs that are cupped, such as brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder and similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	So when it falls into one of these limbs and you see the signs of death that I'm telling you about later, then you should know how to perform the removal of that arrow from them, for death follows him where he is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you cannot see these signs of evil and the arrow is not hidden deeply within the body part, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates through to the mouth, and a siphon is present above the head, this happens: for these conditions often result in headache, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, cramps, confusion of mind, and vomiting.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may come out through the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is lost and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white, paste-like wetness comes out from the wound location.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it comes out of him like bodily fluid.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	And if these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left mammary gland; and one feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in empty space.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of a pulse: and blood flows out from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And this results in coldness at extremities, and cold sweating, and fainting fits.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	You will know that death is likely to occur without much doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	The sign of an arrow when it pierces the lung is blood flowing out foamy from the wound: and the swells that follow the neck turn, and the color of the sick changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales a large, deep breath, seeking the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the pericardium, which is in the chest: then it's near thin ribs: and a great sighing occurs with intense pain, with heaving: and all shoulder limbs move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it will expel something undigested from the elbow with food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly and lodges there, it will expel some feces from the wound, or a hair, or an intestinal segment that has already been ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for his treatment, nor for the removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine is discharged: and something proceeds from it to the external parts, and the pain becomes stronger over the weak: then you will know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	As for the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, trachea, ribs, sternum, thigh, and similar parts, they are cured according to various dispositions of the body when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve: and there is no poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I am telling you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you can understand it in relation to your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is why sometimes an arrow falls into the lacrimal apparatus of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So extract it yourself from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he will be healed, and no harm will come to him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And another arrow was extracted by a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden within him, I did not find it except for its thin tip, with which it adheres to his own stick: this was an arrow large among arrows from Turkish bows, made of soft iron, without ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew has been healed therefore, and it does not happen that a bad event occurs in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And another arrow was extracted from the throat of the Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and that is for whom there are ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, follow it beyond the two guides: and now it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I then worked skillfully with her until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow which had pierced his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After which thirty days passed by him, and nothing changed in his situation despite his dispositions, I followed the arrow for him: and I devised a plan concerning it and extracted it: and he was healed and no bad event occurs to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man who had an arrow fall into his back, and a wound had formed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	And after that, seven years later, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had an arrow fall into her belly, and a wound formed over it, and the arrow remained inside her. And nothing changed despite her various dispositions, and the woman did not find any harm in herself from any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man who had an arrow fall into his face. And the wound became solid and remained there, not finding much pain from it. And similar things happened many times.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from the King's principal, which had fallen into his middle of the nose, and it was now leaning towards the right side only slightly: and the entire arrow was concealed.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called upon for his treatment following the case of the arrow up until three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Therefore, I find the wound from the arrow to be very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore, I examined it carefully with my hand and did not feel it; indeed, he himself was finding the puncture and pain inside his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that the puncture was at the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied the place with a plaster containing magnetic and digestive properties, trusting that the area would heal and reveal to me the sign of the arrow so that I could cut above it: and it did not happen that an event occurred at the location indicating that the arrow has followed the site.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I diligently applied the plaster to it for many days: and no events occurred, and the wound hardened temporarily: and he remained unable to extract it for a period of time until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore, I placed an abrasive medicine on it for many days until it opened up: and when I examined him with my hand, I felt the tip of the arrow which adheres to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening with that abrasive medicine until we could clearly see the tip of the arrow: and it passed me about a period of time of around four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the wound had grown larger and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move them around without success: then I did not stop trying with subtlety and inventing methods with tools, until one day I began extracting it using forceps of proper size, according to their shape at the end of the head, until I was able to remove it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And doctors indeed believe that the nasal cartilage does not get restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore restore it again, and the wound was healed, and the sick person recovered completely with health intact: nothing harmed her in any way.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so place this rule and meaning above that which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by its narrative: nor does this book understand it, and a skillful craftsman compares it with little to much. And when there is a surplus, he compares it with that which is lacking, and he discovers a new operation and a new instrument in this art when the decline of events occurs.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say then, that arrows do not emerge from the parts in which they are fixed, unless according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or against the other side of the part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into the fleshed area: and it attracts and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not conform to the exit from the time at which it falls: then you must let it go for a few days until the flesh around it has decomposed. And its attraction will cease and its emergence will occur.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly, if it gets stuck in bone and does not conform to you for an exit, then let it go as well for a few days. And repeat it with its pull and motion every day until it emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not conform to you for an exit after days, then you must bore into the area around the arrow in that bone from every side with a fine drill until the arrows expand.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it in, and pull out itself.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If the arrow is fixed in the head bone and has already penetrated into one of the cerebral cavities, and there appears some manifestation of those conditions that I mentioned: then abstain from drawing out the arrow, instead remove it until equilibrium comes to be after a day.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow has reached the sifach [a part of the body], then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except within the body bone and does not penetrate up to the sifach: and he remains sick for a few days, and nothing happens to him from those incidents; then use your skills in drawing out and extracting the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If it is fixed strongly and does not yield to your attempt at drawing [the arrow]: then administer trepanning around the area of the arrow, as I have instructed you: afterwards attend to the wound until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If the arrow is already hidden inside the body location and concealed from perception: then seek it out with your attempts.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you sense it, then draw her in with certain tools that suit its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot manage over it due to constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow deeply inside, and there is no opening, nor nerve, nor vein there: then wait upon it until the wound expands and becomes possible for extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If it is held by ears to which there are attachments, then release the fixed flesh around them from every side using all methods that you can. Use tools if they cannot be applied due to inability to manipulate the tissue in breaks of the ears and twisting of them until it resolves.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And you when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is located, then use the twisting motion of your hand with forceps to all parts until you make it come out: and apply delicate finesse so that the arrow is not broken, and that it becomes difficult for you to pull it, and also its removal.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it at once, then allow it for several days until the surrounding tissues decompose.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then remove it again. Indeed, the arrow should be extracted. But if the blood flow is against you, then administer what we said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or a nerve, or a tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use every skillful method possible for the extraction of the arrow: and let it be with ease, tranquility, or perhaps slowly but firmly, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And you must make the patient sick according to the figure when you pull out the arrow, as it was with the case of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however, it is not possible for you to do that, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the body, or has already begun to reach towards the exterior, or causes a lump at the tip of the arrow through sensation from the nearby upper part of the skin, making it visible. Therefore cut it above it and make the cut according to how many forceps can take in her.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it (the arrow): for it becomes easy for exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and widens itself. Then pull it (the arrow).
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: dismiss it for a few days; then reapply it until it escapes.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	And if the arrowwood is in it, then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	And if the wood fell and there is a need to apply force: then insert that tool into it, so that its concavity enters into the arrow's tail: then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	And if the Arrow is concave, then push it out with the tool inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	Indeed, an arrow moves through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must hollow out all the flesh where the poison is: if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	And then care for it with what is suitable in relation to this.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	And if the arrow has fallen in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or on the side: and it is close to what you touch with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut it, and dig away from the incision of a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	And afterwards heal the wound if you see it, and care for it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of Forcips, with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Their ends are similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp over an arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many types are made from them, large, small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its shape, and the width of the wound and its conformation.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Shape of the Impeller concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the impeller for the deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is like the extremity of the deaf person, such as the radius, so that its entry is directed into a concave bow and it is pushed along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This is the concave end of the impeller, like a feather of a bird: so that the entry point of the arrow is directed into it and its impulse is applied.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On venous bloodletting.
Caput XCVII.	Title 77.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	There are thirty veins for bloodletting, which run their course in the body.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Among these, sixteen are found in the head: two of the pulse veins, which are behind the ears and called 'two herbs'; and two arteries, which appear in both temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of both eyes, which are called 'watching veins'; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and a vein that is at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two jugulars, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins that are in the upper lip.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are the veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins to be used for bloodletting in the arms are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the cephalic, and it comes from the side of the sleeve: and they call this vein the head vein commonly.
Et Fusca.	And Fuchsia.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And it is called Media Una, and it is composed from the branch of Basilica and the branch of Cephalica: and they name her common blood of the body.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And Basilica, it is placed inside the domestic side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And they call her by the common name of abdominal blood.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the vein of the arm, it is placed over the elbow: that is where phlebotomy occurs, and that is which appears above the thumb clearly.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And Salvatella: it is the vein that exists between the annular and the minimal [artery]: and there are two branches for her.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	In the calf, and in the foot, there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is which is under the curvature of the thumb from the wild side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second one is Saphena: its location is at the heel on the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And vein Nesse: its location is at the heel on the wild side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the calf, there are three other veins similar to these.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	¶ On bloodletting with two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	For bloodletting with two veins which are after the ears, it is beneficial for old catarrhs, and headache, and ear discharge, and bad head ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of bloodletting is as I describe it.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is done by cutting the head of the sick person: and its scalp is rubbed at the site of the two veins with good friction using a coarse cloth.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then let the patient stretch his neck with the arm, until two veins become visible.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And those places are behind the ears at two depressed spots on the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	So, search for these with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, there mark the spots with a branding iron.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a surgical scalpel for phlebotomy, and that one is called the Incidens.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it under the vein into the skin until the phlebotomy tool reaches the mouth of the vein.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then raise your hand with the vein and skin towards above, and cut the vein along with the skin in a descending manner.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the cut be as much as two joined fingers, or roughly that; and make it bleed as much as you can.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with bandages, and remove them when the wound has healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And now, at the beginning of this book, there is mention of making cuts and their cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	Section 1: On bloodletting using two arteries in the arm.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	However, two arteries which are useful in the two places of bloodletting for benefit: it is the temporal artery and the superficial temporal artery, and the flow of excess secretions towards the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of bloodletting for these is as I am going to tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	The patient should stretch their neck significantly until two veins become visibly apparent: and it must be demonstrated that the pulse of these is felt under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark the spots with a branding iron.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin above the vein with your finger up to the upper part, and insert the phlebotomus coming downwards below it, then lift the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it as you did in the other two veins: and let blood flow from the blood according to the amount needed.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then relieve the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then place a cloth and strips over it, and bind the area strongly above the constriction: and remove it until the patient is healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And now recall that preparation, and its incision, and the extraction at the beginning of this book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	¶ Concerning frontal vein bloodletting after cephalic bloodletting.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	However, the benefit of frontal vein bloodletting is after cephalic bloodletting, for old ailments of the face: and for migraine, and redness: and for foul sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of this bloodletting is as I will tell you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	Grip the patient's neck with your hand until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the tool that is called the Fossorial Instrument.
Cuius haec est forma.	And this is its form.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	Place the prominent edge of the Fossorial Instrument's head over the vein and strike it with your thumbnail or with another tool in a similar manner. Allow the blood to flow according to how you desire.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then relieve the puncture of the patient and bind it until they are healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes an opening is made with a broad bloodletting instrument.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary that it be a phlebotomy for acute extremities, like the other phlebotomies, indeed it should be for broad extremities.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And for the phlebotomy, follow the deviation: because it is close by: and perhaps when the phlebotomy tool is fine, it might break within it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	¶ On Phlebotomy in two Lacrymal veins.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The treatment for the two veins that are located in the two lacrimal areas of both eyes is aimed at relieving symptoms caused by scabies and redness: and also the disturbances within the eye and the discomforts on the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the quality of these phlebotomies is such that the sick person should tighten their neck with an outstretched hand.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then perform the phlebotomy on them, and stand above his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And perform the phlebotomy according to the deviation to a length that is somewhat short, using a small phlebotomy tool, slightly broadened because there is no flesh in the location.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	Indeed, if the phlebotomy tool is thin for an extremity, perhaps it might break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make the bleeding run out as much as you need from the blood that is there.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place your thumbs over them and tighten them at night once, then release them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	¶ On Phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The phlebotomy of the Nasal Veins is performed for acute fevers and violent heat, as well as facial discomforts such as headaches and redness that occur on the face: particularly when it is chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And what is the quality of this bloodletting, that it tightens the patient's neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a delicate, long bloodletting tool. Fix it in the middle of the rabbit's body, between what distinguishes the nose according to its right orientation.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Since the vein is not perceptible by touch there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it must be that your hand with the bloodletting tool is only slightly pressed: and you should make the flow from the blood according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then tie that one overnight.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	### Guidelines for Venous Bloodletting
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	Two forms of bloodletting with Guidegi are useful for constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and pustular eruptions and bad sores, and those that corrode, that is, herpes-like conditions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And the quality of these bloodlettings is such that they tighten the patient under both on their neck when bound: and let the artisan stand over the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then direct the bloodletting tool along the vein to the width of the bloodletting, slightly pressing it.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then extract from the blood a measured amount, or according to what you see as needed for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do similarly with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Then release the bandage, and tie both veins together in the middle: so that the patient does not get overheated.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And let her rest until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	Indeed, the wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On bloodletting using a syringe by Alhuberish.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	However, Algeberich considers bloodletting with a syringe to be beneficial: because it facilitates the absorption of alcohol and the decay of gum tissue: and bad sores: and cracks in the lips, and bad sores, even those that are in the nose, and around its circumference.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of such bloodletting is to make the patient sit in front of you and hold their neck with your arm.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn the patient's lips and look at two veins: one is from the right lip, and the other is from their left side: and the demonstration of each is by the darkening (or discoloration) of the armpit.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And this is true: because there are small, dark veins around them.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	So make each cut in the direction of incidence.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt about you, and you do not know which one it is: then direct yourself to the cut of the larger ones, and that one will be more obvious.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly, do the same for the two veins in the upper lip: and there is quite a lot of custom with that: and make cuts for the two veins in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On bloodletting using the vein under the tongue after the cephalic bloodletting procedure.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Indeed, the two veins which are under the tongue for bloodletting are useful: because the cephalic bloodletting is aimed at ulcers in the throat, nausea of the stomach, and discomforts of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of bloodletting is this, that the sick person should sit between your hands in front of the sun: and observe his breath, and look under his tongue from the side of him one vein, and from the other side of him another vein: and each color descends to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore both for bloodletting: and guard yourself not to make the last your hands in the act of bloodletting.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For beneath him are arteries, and perhaps there may be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	¶ Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	And indeed there are three veins that undergo bloodletting at the elbow, which in all people have a custom of flowing during bloodletting.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by pricking with a myrtle broad lancet: or by rubbing with oil for thinness of the descent: or by cutting with a surgical knife and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them there are types that are broad and fine according to the width and tightness of the veins. The form of the myrtle lancet for bloodletting is such that it is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening shallow, full, advancing, visible, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is smaller in width and more slender at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bloodletting of thin veins that contain thin yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On Bloodletting in the Basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica, which is one of these three types of bloodletting, proves to be beneficial.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it extracts blood from the illnesses that are under the throat and neck, as it follows the chest and belly; and suits a bloodletting method for a blooddrawer, so they should be careful and avoid fear of it because there is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	So if they go wrong and add to the point of bloodletting, it will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary that the blooddrawer use the Basilica with a prickling bloodletting tool: rather, she should use one that follows with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	And if the appearance of the Basilica is not evident with a clear manifestation, then it should be replaced by another one and switched to another, or you should search for one of its branches. Or use the bloodletting tool called 'Funus Brachii' instead of that.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	It is indeed evident and can be used along with the bloodletting tool Anesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you use bloodletting of its own kind, then it is necessary to prepare before tightening the arm bandage until you can touch the site until you know the pulse location.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the site with hot wax, then place the arm, and cut the vein section in a concave manner using Alnesil's bloodletting tool, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful not to strike the impact through the space from the site of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, with the tightening of the bandage, an increase at the site marked with wax, then that increase is the expansion of the artery: so she should do it properly.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you observe blood flowing during phlebotomy in a manner similar to a child's urine, and the blood is fine, red, then you will know that it comes from arterial blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	So then hurry up, and place your finger on it at the longer distance, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	So when blood is taken out (as it is taken multiple times), then grip the arm, and let it go: and beware of the patient's movement due to fear: and be over him/her.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move him for a few days until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if blood is not being taken and it's overpowering you: and there isn't any medicine available to you at the moment, then cut the artery when you see it.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	Because its extremities contract and blood is taken out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of leather thong and make it into two. Take one half and hold it tightly over the spot where the vein is tightened up, with the bandage and small stones until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is taken out, that's good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of it with the person whose memory has returned from the place where small stones were removed and blood flowed. And stopping blood in many positions isn't difficult due to the lack of wounds and possibility of bandaging from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	¶ Concerning phlebotomy for the vein Fossa.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The vein Fossa is useful for phlebotomy as it carries blood from the upper part of the head and lower parts of the body. This is because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is necessary for the bloodletter that she be above his fear of bloodletting, because there is a nerve under her.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore they add to the puncture for bloodletting, and he finds a nerve, it happens to her that she becomes unconscious, and healing becomes difficult for him, and perhaps she may not be completely healed.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve is often perceived by touch.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	And in some people if it is hidden and subtle, not being shown: then you should use the bloodletting method that you know where to apply it, with a section like Alnesil's, and accurately find the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	And if there is a vein between two nerves, then find the vein by its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	¶ On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	As for bloodletting of the Cephalic Vein, it is helpful because it draws blood from the head and relieves eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary to apply bloodletting specifically to this vein, if you wish, using an oily bloodletting tool or a myrrh bloodletting tool: for it is the healthiest of all veins because there is no artery nor nerve underneath.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, when performing bloodletting, it is advisable to apply the tool gently on top of the head only and search for a softer spot: it does not harm her if it is not found immediately with one strike, so that you can apply the bloodletting tool to that area several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, it may happen in some people that an abscess forms when bloodletting is not done with the first strike, but this apophasis does not harm her in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the utility of phlebotomy and precautions in practicing it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and its incidents, originate from the correction that one must consider in it.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, you must understand for what it is necessary that you know, namely that phlebotomy should not be administered except as part of maintaining health and persistence in its upkeep, and vigilance against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy is done using three veins which are found on the arm, namely the Cephalic, and the Dark, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy is performed at the beginning of April on an empty stomach, truly, and during summer: and autumn, and winter after congestion when signs of fullness are evident.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And phlebotomy is performed on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from that day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy which is administered during illnesses does not have a predetermined hour. Rather, when occasion and necessity call for it, it can be performed at night, day, or any hour, at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary to perform phlebotomy on children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor is pregnancy during menstruation. However, it can be performed from the fourth to the seventh month of pregnancy.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	And old men are not subjected to phlebotomy unless they have already passed sixty years of age.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When someone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for any manner, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before the phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is a large amount of retained feces in them. This way, to prevent potentially harmful, putrid excesses from intestines attracting to the main limbs during phlebotomy.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	The patient is not bled with the pincers, that is, the nausea-inducing emetics: nor is he vomited at or made drunk until this is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	The sick man does not have hydrocele.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let bloodletting be avoided after a bout of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, increased sexual activity, labor, exercise, watchkeeping, fasting, and anything else that dissipates virtue from bodily or animal strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Next, in the subtlety of fluids before this, if blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to do that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Next, if bathing doesn't forbid anything, the patient should bathe or engage in some exercise to refine the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And apply bloodletting to his chest on the third day, as we said: and try so that his body is cleansed of all animal evils that might occur that day: such as distress, anger, fear, and similarly, all physical events like labor, punishment, overconsumption, and similar issues.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let his seat be filled with the things of which human use flows by custom from their aromaticity, smell, flavor and similar qualities through the possibility of quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Next, the bloodletting physician should sit on a stool that is higher than the height required for bloodletting. Afterward, he extends his arm and rubs it with his own hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Next, tie the ligature with a thong, and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when an unequal or excessive constriction occurs in the constriction, it then prohibits the flow of blood. Or if there is a weakening of the constriction, even that prohibits the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then, after the ligation, it should be that the one to perform the bloodletting rubs their hands together until the veins are filled and are perceptible to sensation.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then, the bloodletter should cleanse the area with some old oil, in the proper manner.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then, place his index finger of his left hand on the vein at the desired location for the bloodletting, a little bit: so that it does not escape the vein, and percussion is set.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For, within veins is what you find like a fleeing chord at bloodletting: and from them it is that which is full of windiness: and when the one to perform bloodletting places their hands on such, it contracts under the bloodletting, and it is diverted by the bloodletter, and the bloodletter does not open the vein: and if they do open it, it becomes constricted. Therefore, for this reason it should be that the bloodletter holds firmly, and is diligent in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then, place down the one to perform bloodletting.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened from the elbow region, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeatedly do this at another place below that region or above it with pressure: if the location does not allow.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it does not allow, or if the patient expands, then let him go for one day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it might attract a warm pustule.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should they enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he may repeat the bloodletting, if desired.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small or if the blood flows subtly: and you measure to ensure that no quantity of it escapes from the blood: then repeatedly perform bloodletting at the hole itself according to its direction, and add a little in each operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with urgency before the site is sown, for the wound is usually small in many people during surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	And if you see it already sown up, then do not proceed over it completely, for there is nothing to excuse before you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put on top of it something from the fat and oil mixture, because it expedites the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	This method is better here than the actual oil itself, and than other types of oil as well.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the oil mixture in all of your bloodlettings, where blood flows out when you puncture veins under prohibition for blood flow. And they do this with a preparation from Tyrian purple and saffron, when it is placed over the spot from one of them.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood thickens and breaks up when it is coarse.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If there happens to be a large wound during bloodletting, which often occurs, especially for those who are not bled except through that method or have small openings in veins, then proceed and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, gently heated: and bind it once: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you should do that after the blood has flowed out of the same vein or another vein until its full amount is out.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If there remains in the place for some days a residue of blackness or verdure after bloodletting, it is not harmful. And if you wish, apply something from myrrh or balsam: or something from the mint juice, that is calamus or similar to that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Indeed, quite often it happens that there are pustules and prominences during bloodletting in the Basilica style.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore place your hand on it, then if you find softness upon pressing it onto itself, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, take care, as you place upon her (or him) something from what we said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood flows from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster with it where there is hardness, so that the place may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it along with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And you must take out from every person in their blood according to the strength of its qualities.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what becomes apparent from the color that reddens over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go until it turns red; and similarly if you see that it is thick: then let it go until it becomes finer; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for the one who is full, strong, and requires blood extraction by means of a single method, so that bloodletting may be increased through the veins, and become transverse: and in the one who is weak, it should be opposite to this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extracts it in various ways, and that there be a tight hole. And better than what is administered in bloodletting through veins is for it to be a crosscut section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from cutting the nerve. And it is better and more advantageous than bloodletting along its width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for those who are accustomed to come through bloodletting with scorching (syncopis), it is necessary that before the bloodletting they eat a moderate piece of bread soaked in water with pomegranate juice: or secaniabin if it has been heated. And extract him from his blood in three ways, or four times.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the blood is cooled in nature, then before a bloodletting he should take bread infused in mule's milk syrup, or in a syrup sweetened with honey, seasoned with spices, or in an aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	And if there occurs syncope at bloodletting and the cause of his bleeding is many: then it must be that he drinks meat broth, and a subtle aromatic syrup; and uses aromatics with algae and linseeds for rubbing on his chest with this: and makes use of other things which we said in division in chapter syncope from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	And for those who wish to empty their arm and release their blood again: it must be that he who has bloodletting because of excessive evacuation, and his strength is weak, allows his blood to be released gradually through the amount of strength over consecutive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	And those who wish to empty their arm and release their blood again, if their body is strong: then do this after seven hours, or nine from their first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	And those who wish to draw blood from their body against the side towards which it inclines: it must happen to them on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	And in whose body there is already much blood that has been heated and is increasing, causing a fever to occur: it must be that the blood leaves him once through the mouth, and large quantities are extracted from him. And extend the opening until syncope occurs. After you have maintained all conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood so that death does not occur instead of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Indeed, it often happens like this when the bloodletter doesn't know and falls into negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you are trying to relieve the arm and then relieve the blood flow in a second stage, when the vein's opening has already been sealed off, and makes the removal of blood difficult, to press upon it with pressure while in shock, and let the clamp be extended quickly either way.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	And that is a great evil, indeed dismiss it, until the second bloodletting occurs.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of a bloodletting tool that which has coagulated from the blood at the opening of the vein, and place something dissolved in water over it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something from tarragon oil or saffron over it, and put it under gentle compression until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed there is already an abscess in the vein, then release it, and do not hold it until the abscess subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity prompts to relieve blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either use the bloodletting tool over that place, or in the arm at another vein elsewhere.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But for the bloodletting of the arm's vein at the location of Fossa and Basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is made up from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this bloodletting is such that the sick person should immerse their hand in warm water until it turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then, when the procedure is carried out, apply pressure with a band not too tight but of moderate size.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then, the bloodletting tool should be used gradually across (the area), not laterally, nor in the direction of length; and make the opening wide, and have your bloodletting operation so that you apply bloodletting slightly over the stitch on the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If it is prevented that blood's outlet, then repeatedly immerse your hand in warm water, and let the blood flow in the water until you achieve what you need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however you find yourself in days of summer, then omit the repetition of your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And it is indeed placed that the flow of blood in water is numerous during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this method of bloodletting is beneficial to all veins since there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The phlebotomy of Saluatella uses the right hand and relieves ailments in the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this method of phlebotomy is to grip the mahason hand with a ligament or with your own hand after you insert it into warm water until the vein inflates and its presence becomes very evident.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then perform bloodletting by crossing over the (affected) area.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you hit it completely, that will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve, do not withdraw your hand with the bloodletting instrument.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Underneath it, there are exposed nerves from the flesh of the fingers.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeatedly put your hand into warm water and let the blood flow in that.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood will clot in the vein's opening and prevent its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	So when you have extracted the amount necessary from the blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not harden quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly you should do with every tightly bound branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The reduction of the blood of his phlebotomy however from his left hand, is: because it is conveying to the spleen's discomforts: and similarly perform the phlebotomy of him, as you performed in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The reduction of the blood of his phlebotomy related to the veins, is for the discomforts which are in the lower part of the body, such as the discomforts of the uterus, and retention of menstrual flow, and malfunctions of the kidneys, and old sores on the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of his bloodletting is that the ill man should immerse his foot in hot water: and he should perform a rubbing over it until the veins are abundant: and tie above the cut on the foot with lint.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	Indeed, the site of the veins is at the heel, facing the big toe: and they branch out from it into the face of the foot many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, bloodletting should be performed in the larger branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregation: because this is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If bloodletting were performed on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And suppose your bloodletting in which you perform the bloodletting from obliquely, as if you are trying to hit it: and let the bloodletting be called Neshil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the flow of blood is obstructed, then immerse his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into that, until it is discharged.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the bloodletter misses the vein in the first attempt, then he should proceed with the bloodletting to the upper part little by little, for there is safety, and you do not expect evil from it when you avoid the nerves as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly when the Saphenous vein of the other foot is equal.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the inside of the leg.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	The effectiveness of bloodletting in such cases is when there is pain in the heel, which occurs due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	The quality of bloodletting in this case is to allow the sick person to enter into a bath and warm it up gradually. Then draw on his leg from the side of the heel up to above the ankle by four fingers, using a long thin needle; for it can only be seen because of that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears then according to any ability you can do it, or according to the reflux: it is better either if you make an incision at that point or cut through it.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	Its location is helpful, and this vein is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the touch, then use bloodletting on one of its branches. The one that appears is on the back of the foot and towards the ear region. Be careful around nerves and make the bleeding from the blood as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then release the constriction and place leather over the site of bloodletting, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	Indeed, it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ On the operation of the wind and its quality for use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 48.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Winds occur from the horns and from air, and from wind.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And indeed, Wind Action happens in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	One method involves scarification and the extraction of blood: and there is wind action without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	This 'V通风' which is without incision, operates in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	And indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the types of ventilation that involve incision and bloodletting occur at fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	There are fourteen places on the body to which these types of ventilation can be applied: One is Ventosatio Alnocrati, which is at the very back of the head; one is Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; there are two Alhagdahim ventilations, each corresponding to a pair of cervical laminae simultaneously; one is Vientosae menti, located under the jawbone near the lower part of the mouth; there are two shoulder blade ventilations; one is Vientosae Alachosos at the end of the tail; there are two lung ventitations, each situated in the middle of both arms; there are two leg ventilations; and finally, there are two kidney ventilations.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed, the process of ventilation does not draw out a little blood from minute punctures in your flesh. Because of this, its power does not escape from them as happens with bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary that ventilation, either with fire or without it, be administered when conditions arise due to fullness (diseases), until the entire body has been cleansed.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts us to apply ventilation due to illness or by custom, we administer it at all times during the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, as well as at any other time that occurs.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who when the blood increases within them until it needs to be drained through ventilation, they find a heaviness and dizziness in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there are those who find fullness and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there are those who find itching on their face and forehead, as well as darkness and confusion in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there are those who tremble at the place of their windpipe.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or they may be troubled with their tongue and it might be that blood is expelled.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there are those who see blood and redness, slain people and wounds, and things similar to these in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	So when we see something from them, and particularly if it occurs on the third day of the month: we then predict that the windpipe will start to function again after passing through two or three hours.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The discomfort of the windpipe at the back of the neck is as follows: it tends to increase in the head and what flows out reaches the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should occur after a full body evacuation.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is indeed the cephalic phlebotomy that produces a suction.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use this practice on someone with a cold complexion or where there is phlegm.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it causes great harm to such individuals.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of this, it is not allowed to use these practices on old individuals or those who have cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	And if one applies this practice excessively, forgetfulness arises over it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for that reason it is necessary to instruct the Ventosator, so he withdraws his hand with the windbag somewhat below the area of operation, fearing the risk of forgetting the origin.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or Alkehel is at the site of the Phlebotomy of Fuscae and the Phlebotomy of Basilica. And for this reason it combines with dyspnea, constriction of breathing, suction sound of the instrument, coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary to move the Alkehel suction pump somewhat upwards because if placed below, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosatio or Alhagdahim combines with head injuries, ophthalmia, and migraines, as well as puncturing, toothache, and is at the site of the Phlebotomy of Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to instruct the Ventosator not to press his hand with the scarification: so as not to damage an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosation at the chin combines with saliva in the mouth, and gum decay, and similar conditions that occur in the mouth: it serves as a place for phlebotomy called alieherich which is situated on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventosation of the spatulas combines with alchafacham, which is produced from folding and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosation of the inner parts of two fingers combines with benefit of phlebotomies of three veins - Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalica: for it draws blood from all those fine veins which are in the flesh. And these smaller veins draw out from other thicker veins until the attraction reaches the three larger veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you should instruct the Windistributor that he must not proceed too far during incisions: because there is flesh stripped off, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The suction device that is used to draw out the air, when applied over hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers, leads to bleeding.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you should instruct the Windistributor to ensure that the suction device is large and made of air. For it needs a strong suction and perhaps the finer suction devices may break, requiring larger incisions during the process.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The limb suction devices reduce the evident diminution; for they draw blood from the entire body and bring old pains to the kidneys, uterus, and bladder. They induce menstruation, cause cramps, and result in fatigue: standing as alternatives to double phlebotomy and other forms of treatment.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they greatly weaken the body and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the improvement of the Alhorcobe's suction is similar to that of improving two limb suction treatments.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of positioning the Windistributors is such that you place the suction device in the first void and use a balanced suction. Do not prolong the position of the windistributor, but put them quickly and remove them quickly, so that fluids arrive at the location evenly: do not stop repeating this until you see the area already red and inflamed, and blood rash appears: then, perform incisions, and repeat the suction gradually over time.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the arrangement of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who have tender flesh and few hairs, you should perform one incision only on them, no more: so as not to cause the area to become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the wind instrument user, that he should increase the incision and depth somewhat less: and moderate the suction with ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is congestion in the blood, then you must incise it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In vinegar, first an opening is made for the subtle clarification of blood and its moisture; and in the second, a detailed investigation for the meticulous extraction of thickened blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is extremely fleshy, then a third vinegar incision should be made: in order to achieve the final outcome.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And for the last step, when we wish to extract blood gradually or in parts, a single incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we aim for multiple extractions of blood, then we perform numerous incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it must be incised with deep incisions. And the end of the operation in terms of incision corresponds to the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which must be administered from oils at the placement of Ventosarum positions, and what should the wind instrument user beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In this case, for skin that is thick, tough, dark, and whose pores are constricted, the affected areas should be rubbed with open, soothing, and dissolving oils: if it's during summer time, like almond oil, or grapefruit oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it's during winter time, then use narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or sarbatina oil: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed the excess is thick and cold, then use bitter oil, or balsamic oil, or white oil, or terebinth oil: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If there is an abundance of the worms in large bowels, tender meat: then it must be forbidden to consume oil and these parts which contained the worms after ventosa treatment should be washed with rose water, or with cold water, or with warm water, or with water from cucumber, or with water from portulaca: and similarly for such cases.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	That is, for whom the blood is full of moisture, wash the ventosas with vinegar, or with water from myrtle, and sumach: and similarly in such cases.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	For those whose excesses are large, wash the ventosas with old wine, or with water from saffron, or with decoction of onions, or of chamomile: and similarly in such cases.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it must be that ventosa treatment is done in a bath or at the edge of a bath, or else it should be administered one hour, or two hours after leaving the bath.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not allowed that anyone sleeps after ventosa treatment.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What should be done regarding the regulation of ventosas or phlebotomy before treatment?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And afterwards, you should consider first: then if the person who underwent ventosas or phlebotomy is choleric, and there is an irritation and inflammation in their blood, it must be treated with cooling measures, like a chilled pomegranate. And also eat lettuce mixed with vinegar and spinach, and garlic, and almonds. And similarly for such cases.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And give him foods like chicken and fowl meat stewed in vinegar, and cooked meals with herbs, and similarly for such cases.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for those with a cold constitution, it should be taken in a drink made of honey syrup, or almond syrup, or an almond-flavored concoction made from the seeds: and he should consume moderate scented wine, which is between old and new wines, and he should be advised to use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place his food as young chickens and pigeons: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and the young of doves.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	It is necessary for the amount of drink to exceed that of food during wind and bloodletting. And it should be given at certain times in some people during the hours of sunrise or aloe water, or medicine from musk, which is muscatel, or asafetida before wind and bloodletting, and before or after bloodletting: to strengthen major limbs, and to purify the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ On Winds without Incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	As for winds that are done without incision, these are winds that are applied over the pubis, and spleen, and ankle, and over the stomach, navel, and places of kidneys, and behind the waistband. For these limbs do not tolerate an incision upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought through these applications unless there is an attraction from the blood member to the member: as we place the wind on nipples during the illness of nasal blood flow.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to relieve cold wind that is concealed within the body member: as we apply wind over the stomach and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For they thin out the body member, warm it up, and remove pain because they dissolve that wind.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	And when there is excess fluid or a stone in the kidneys, it is applied over them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For due to its force of attraction, perhaps it opens the congestion, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly, it does this when placed over the pubis and spleen regarding winds to be removed from both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these wind instruments are used for vacuums with only a cut being made.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are used with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are used filled with warm water in stomach aches: and this is that the wind instrument is filled, it should be large, water alone hot or water into which herbs suitable for use have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of using the wind instrument with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the size of its opening be two fingers wide as we have formed it. Its depth should be half a palm. And let there be a small hole on the side near the middle for the needle to enter. Make it out of air or citron wood, with a thickness similar to that of human hair. It must not injure the skin when placed above it. Also place a rod made of iron or air in the center on which you can place a candle with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	Now this wind instrument is made large, bigger than what we have described, and slightly smaller according to the severity of the ailment and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	Wind instruments for children, and those intended to relieve weakness are different from wind instruments designed for adult men with robust bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this wind instrument on the body with fire is to light a thin wick made from linen or a small candle from wax directly below the transverse rod in the middle of the wind instrument. So that the heat touches just beneath the wind instrument, avoiding direct contact with the patient's body, preventing it from being burned by the flame.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it over the body and let a finger be placed on the hole I mentioned until we hold the wind instrument. While waiting, remove the finger and allow steam to escape through that hole, immediately causing the wind instrument to release its effect.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply fire according to its kind, and repeat that if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In the case of Ventosa which is administered for pleurisy when mixed with water, there is no transverse rod or hole: and it is not administered unless the water fills it, and then only placed upon the body.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger the Ventosa is, the more water it can take in, which makes it better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ On suspending Bloodsugar solutions.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodsugar remedies are not administered in many places, except where there is no possible position for ventosas due to their shape, such as the lip, gum, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on an exposed part of the body from the flesh, such as a finger, nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: to cleanse from impurities that are in sweet waters obtained through bloodsugar, free from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be immersed day and night in sweet water until the contents are expelled, ensuring nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then cleanse the body first with bloodletting and using suction cups.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then clean the sick part until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place it on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they fill up and fall down, and there is a possibility of suction at the place with the suction cup, then it is mostly towards improvement; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then when there's plenty of water, it's rubbed and pressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood prolongs after the situation of Blood Sugar's case, and this is with residue: then immerse linen cloth in cold water, and place it above until elimination occurs.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood is multiplied, then crush it with ground grain or fowl, or similar items from astringents, until the blood ceases.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place the middle parts of shavings that have been peeled over the site: and remove them until the beans adhere to the site, for then blood is ceased.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if Blood Sugar's usage is needed that when possible, one should change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If they forbid Blood Sugars from dripping, then cleanse the site with freshly bled blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or seal the tip at places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for they stick immediately when they sense anything from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you wish for them to fall, grind something from ground Aloes or salt, or ash over them and they will immediately fall.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book III of Albucasis's Book of Surgery.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	General Discussion on Restoration, Dislocation, and the Treatment of Torsions, and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	Head I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, being restoration of fractures and accidents of dislocations in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, my sons, that many doctors and the common people speak of this chapter with conceit, and those who have never looked into an ancient book or read a single letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this measure is deprived of knowledge in our earthly land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never received any real good from it, and I do not gain from it that which I only gain through the length of reading of old books, and studying above their understanding, until I extract knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then by the experience and study of the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you the entirety of what that contains my knowledge from this chapter: and beyond that is my experience, after I shortened it for you and released it from the occupation of elongation, then shortened it at the end of shortening, showed it at the end of declination, and shaped it with many shapes from the forms of the instruments used in it, as was done in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summary and collections from the breaking of bones, from those which must be provided beforehand as necessary for us to begin recalling the parts broken, and variously, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	We should say in the introduction to this chapter, summaries of discourse and chapters that lead to an understanding at first for the craftsman towards the station above their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when something happens to someone like a breakage, or dislocation, or twist, or accident, then it should be your first priority to prepare for bloodletting him, and relieve himself, or both simultaneously: if nothing prevents this, such as weakness in strength; or he is that person who encounters any of these things being young or old and weak. Or the time allows for extreme heat, or extreme cold significantly.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, cold spices, and fowl meats, as well as lean meats: and forbid wine, and fatty meats, and overfilling from foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Once you are free from the discomfort of hot baths and no longer feel the discharge to the member: then the sick person returns to his original routine of diet according to his accustomed mode.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the broken mouth begins to recover, then the sick person should eat with nourishing food in large quantities, richly flavored: such foods as are made from cooked wheat mixed with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and organs of birds, and eggs, and fresh fish. And also thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this regimen, the clotting of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you will know that broken bones, when they are found in men who are at the beginning of old age and decrepit, cannot always remain and consolidate according to their nature, because of the drying out of their limbs. They only consolidate and continue those which are from them at the end of softness, like bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature binds over the broken bone from every part something resembling glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens itself until it coagulates with each other, and binds together until it reaches the end of strength and firmness as it was before, until nothing prevents it from its operations: for this reason, it becomes necessary to provide food for the sick foodstuff, in which there is thickness, viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you will know that the species of fractures are various, according to the variety of limbs: for instance, a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the rib bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly, all other limbs differ amongst themselves. And I come with the recollection of all species of fractures explained in his chapter separately from each other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures are also distinguished within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For there is a curved fracture, beyond which stars occur within it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are fractures called stars, that is, specks, and additions proceeding, as in a reed when it is adjusted for writing with a pen.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the tip: and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And for each species there is an art, or its own tool for restoring it, according to what will recall its memory, distinguished in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from the way one recognizes a bone fracture, there is its curvature and height of itself. It appears to the sense, and sound it makes when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	So, if there is no apparent curvature in the place, nor sound when you touch it with your hand during agitation, and the patient does not find a great pain: then there is no fracture there. Indeed, it may be possible that there is curvature or a small crack. Therefore, you do not need to move it with your hand and complete compression, rather place over it from medicines which recall its memory after the appropriate moment has come. Then the constriction is tightened subtly.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you will know that when the place is curved and divided into two parts beyond which stars occur, but yet every part moves away from its own comparison: then it becomes necessary for you to begin from your hour in correcting it, equalizing it before heat affects him.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	And if heat should affect him, then let him rest for several days until the apoplectic heat subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equally, it can divide according to whatever measure one wishes due to its gentleness and ingenuity.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it, and its equal division, is easier than with bones where there have been fractures.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it, according to how you will remember it later on.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if it's a hand or foot: or with your own hand, if the member is short: or with two threads, or with thread and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And place your position where you put the member on the equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions with all your ingenuity, and in any way possible in their places: and beware according to your strength, that no harm occurs due to the operation, nor injury: and try according to your strength, that you apply one or two bones with their fellow, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time to test and touch the member with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	And if you see anything different there, correct it and adjust that according to the strength of your own power.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of an excessive extension and a strong compression, as many do with foolish practices.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For indeed, many times this happens due to their operation, leaving a hot blister, or constriction in the member: as we have already seen from their operations happening often.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then after the division and proper operation, and securing that member, as well as peace and calmness, instruct the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him take a precaution, so that he does not move himself during his usual waking hours, and his dream at the time of his turning, and shaking, and during his expelling, and all his movements with the last strength of his.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let him take care so that the position of the limb follows with pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	This means, because when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb's position: then it should be necessary for him to change his position to another from that one, with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take care with him, so that his position be that one equal and straight: so that there is no deformation of the limb when he recovers.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the ligament of a broken limb is according to what I narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken limbs vary in their thinness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those that are thus thin among them, like the arm, and finger, and stick (or possibly small bone), and similar to these, then it should be a soft, subtle wrapping of the cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those that are among them which are thick, like the thigh and leg, should have a broad, durable wrapping around them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the large limb and tightens it from every part with an equal pressure, so that it does not deform the limb.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then start after your evacuation by placing the suitable liniment for this onto it, on a soft plaster over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligament over the site of the fracture in three wraps or four, according to the size of the limb: and press your hand with the ligament moderately.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it to the upper part of the place of fracture, and apply pressure less than what you used before when pressing the fractured area.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself gradually from the place of fracture, and gently alleviate the tightness little by little, until you feel a large amount coming from the healthy area.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another piece [of material or substance], and again envelop the fractured area with it in layers.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Next, proceed with the wrapping to the lower part of the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation consist of tightness and alleviation of that, as we described in the first enveloping above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the layers something soft like plaster or cloth, to correct the curvature of the fracture if there is any; if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then envelop it with another piece of material.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then, when there is no swelling or heat in the place, immediately apply central points of heating sticks on top of these envelopments.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or pus in the area, then place over it something that sits on the pus and removes the swelling. And let it be removed after a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind the heating sticks to it at this point.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the heating sticks be broad, shaved, formed wisely: or let them be made from wood which is used to make sieves, those made from pine, or palm leaves, or galingale (a type of plant): and let the entire width of the heating sticks have this shape, and this same form.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it must be that the heating stick which is placed over this contraction is somewhat wider and thicker than the other sticks. And the length of the heating stick should depend on what is suitable for the size and strength of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie above the Astellas with another thread, according to the first constriction of the same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then, tie it up from above with other threads, as we have said about the constriction: and it is that your constriction should be over the breakage site more. And the longer it extends away from the break, the smaller the constriction will be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it must be that the threads have medium thickness and fineness, and they should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are large, as I have seen from operations where they use their own thread made of twisted linen strings, there is a great mistake: because the constriction falls with them beyond quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, very fine threads do not suit: because you cannot follow through the constriction with what you want with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it should not be less than a finger between an Aster and another Aster.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	For if the invalid is injured through the ends of the Aster after the constriction in healthy areas: then place under them a soft padding or dyed wool until nothing is injured from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however there is a fracture with the ulna, and a disruption occurs in the skin, I would administer treatment according to my memory in the second chapter for its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken member needs to be tied with Aster from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	This is because a large member should not place Aster upon itself until after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of hot baths.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	This is the method of bandages which the ancients used to apply over fractures and dislocations for restoration.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The concise method of plaster application, which heals fractures and is suitable for various body types, especially for women and children: because it works on what isn't overcome by heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is as follows: you take from the grain mill powder and the flour sap which hangs on the walls of the mill during its operation. Mix it like this except when sieving mixes it with the starch water. And place the mixture not thick nor fine.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use that.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other method of plastering, it heals fractures and dislocations, and torsions.

Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is the result of good composition, it heals broken bones quickly and suits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The other method for plastering also supports fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	The recipe for myrrh flowers, almond, and white aloe. The quantity is all of X myrrh grains, and aloes of both kinds totaling V grains and six parts of Armenian gum. All are finely ground, sieved, then mixed with water or starch water. They are then administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method for plastering to heal fractures and separate bones from their places: it soothes the pain they cause, prevents tearing of bones and breaks.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	A clean wool is taken, and it is submerged in vinegar, and cooked oil: and placed over the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And indeed, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but it is good for cooling down the hot spots: and it drives out pains specifically.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of plastering that restores a fractured mouth.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the deaf fig and the leaves of the wild borage, and rub everything well. Make a plaster from both.

Recipe for the root of the Altai, and chamomile, and flowers of the violet, and herb flour, all in equal parts: everything is ground, and mixed with wine if no part is heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If indeed it has been heated, then mix that with water infused with coriander or simply water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of plaster for stronger resolution compared to this first one, when a hard blister occurs during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.

Everything is ground, and mixed with water infused with willow bark, or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	Apply the entire preparation according to the heat of the member and the tranquility of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that a plaster should be placed over a fractured member during its restoration, except for one made from catgut and oil: no other: and he instructed that it should be of medium size between thickness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galeno recommends that during the repair of a broken member, they should be placed upon what was broken with warmth treatments, like myrrh, and frankincense, and other such things as we have described.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of applying the bandage which strengthens against injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for plaster made from a mix of mugwort, chickpeas, human hair pins, or bird feathers, and ashes of plants like the altea, with equal parts salt. They are ground together, sifted, and compounded. It can then be used as a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity to use is such that the bandage remains in place. You should then check if there is no pain nor itchiness for the sick person, and if the broken mouth does not move from its place. If these conditions are met, do not dissolve it on many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If for him there is itching at that place, or an annoying pain, or swelling occurs: then hasten and dissolve it after an hour, and remove the plaster from it. Then take a soft cloth or sponge, or a damp sea sponge. Immerse it in warm water, and wash the area with it until the itching stops and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then release the limb to rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it wool that has been soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bind it overnight until you are assured of not having a hot fever, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and the pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply it for gentle compression and a small amount of plaster. Don't bind it tightly with your initial application or in any subtle way until the injury is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the pus, redness, pain, swelling, and all other incidents have completely disappeared, and you no longer need plaster or constriction, then apply that same thing as you did at first evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing from what we have said happens to any member, then do not separate it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when twenty days have passed since the whole thing is released, according to what you perceive from the dissection of the member as we said, until when the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh on it begins: add then in your tightening more than your first tightening completely; and also add in the thickening of food for the sick person, according to how much is remembered of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the place of the fracture is already drying and diminishing more than it should: then you will know that nutrition is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore immerse him with warm water everywhere where you have immersed him, and let that happen for all three days, and rejoice at the partial tightening.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this procedure, nutrition runs to the member and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which the ignorant restorers do from a fracture of the member using another method, when it is not restored as it should be and is instead restored according to its curvature, is an error from their procedure, and great fear. And if it were straight, the ancients in their books would have said this and operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of theirs there at all, and it is better that this does not happen.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	### Chapter on the procedure in case of injury to the head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	Types of fractures are various, and their shapes are numerous: and the causes of them are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from impact with an instrument: and the impact removes all of the mouth up to the siphacum, which is under the bone, just as an axe cuts through wood. And because of this, it is named this type of fracture, Axial Fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	When a cut touches part of the bone and hits its surface without penetrating to the very end of it; this type of injury is called a Kaluan fracture, that is, an absolutely open fracture.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound from two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a wound from a fracture which results from rubbing or grinding. The cause of this is hitting with a stone, or falling on the stone, or similar cases.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this kind of fracture is also penetrating, already approaching the periosteum which is under the bone; or it's on the surface of the bone. And there is a wound from these two fractures as well, whether small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture that occurs within the bone as thin as a hair. This is a small crack and for this reason it's called a Capillary fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these there is a fracture that happens through accidents or the impact of stones and similar events where they make an entry into the layers of the bone to its inner parts forming a cavity, as occurs with irons when struck by force and some part of them goes inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	A great deal happens like this in the bones of cavities, as with the heads of children's bones.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	These are the various types of fractured separation injuries, and I refer to that entire description in its appropriate place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these types of fractures through their identification on the site of injury and examination with tests alongside removal of the decayed flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The Capillary fracture is recognized by this method: it is revealed over the bone, washed off, and covered with a wax seal; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the circumstances surrounding the patient: then if you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as nausea, fever, loss of consciousness, inability to speak, fits, sudden onset illness, reddening of the eyes and similar conditions arising from various incidents. Without doubt, such patients will not recover. And if you see non-threatening circumstances and hope for recovery, then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If someone comes to you with an injury at first when it is being inflicted: and this happens during winter days, then you must strive for the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every treatment.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during summer days, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone spoils from pus and those accidents that we described happen.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture has already reached the edge of pus touching the brain, and it occurs with small pieces and traction: then you should introduce the broken and rubbed part, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And you should cut the head of the wounded person: and remove what is above the bone according to whatever possible method for you: and according to the form of wounds, and what is slighter on the sick.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If during the examination you come across bleeding from the bone or a warm abscess: then offer to it what is necessary with it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you should fill the gap with wet bandages soaked in wine and rose oil: and allow the wound to rest until the abscess settles, and be at ease from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	Indeed, there is one method where you will cut the mouth with the tightly closed canine tooth: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another canine tooth after the wider space between the canine teeth: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	And then also apply another canine tooth that is even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is for there to be a variety of canine teeth with you: some will be wider than others, and some shorter than others. They should have sharp ends at their last parts and they should be made of iron or steel. And use it efficiently when striking over the canine tooth, so as not to shake its head and harm it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the mouth is strong and hard, then you must drill around its circumference before administering any canine teeth with what are called Terebras that do not penetrate deeply. They are not named this way just because they don't pass through the end of the bone flesh to what comes after it; because the end of the Terebra, which is round on top of that sharp head part and similar to a small edge prevents being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is suitable for you to take a large number of these Terebras, each one fitting the thickness of the bone until you have every skull with a Terebra: whose quantity of sharp ends in length and width should be according to the thickness of that particular skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of Terebras, or Treparums.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around a broken bone is: place the Terebra on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then exchange the probe for another place, and insert whatever quantity of thickness is between each hole, or roughly that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut through with the Cutters what is between each hole in the bone: and make that smaller than you can above it from the end of thinness, as we said, until you remove the bone or with your hand or using another tool prepared for this: like tweezers and delicate knives.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And you must use all caution so that the probe or cutter does not touch any part of the socket.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	And when you are going around the bone while drilling and it has been separated from the socket if it was continuous with it, and you extract it, you should pull out the roots and even its remaining extremity that stays within the bone using another tool similar to a cutter.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thin and finer than other cutters.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there is any leftover bone or splinters, then take them out with ease using the tool you have at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the wound after that with our mentioned ligatures and ointments.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of the operation is easy, very long from fear alone: which Galen said and praised him greatly; and this is his word.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to start uncovering the portion of bone from the place where the more severe and apparent fracture is. Continue until when you have found that part and placed at its base the end of this lens-shaped cutter which has this form,
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-like part does not cut anything soft. And its sharp part cuts into both sides of it longitudinally, as you see: so that the lens-like part is inserted inside the socket, with its acute face cutting against the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the Incisor from one side with a small mallet until you enter the whole mouth easily, just as it is turned. And be careful by a cloth, that no accidents happen which you fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon was not a fool among men and knew it more than him, nor was he sleeping, then if there remained something attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would strike it off from him with the end of the conical incisor, and free it from him easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	Indeed, it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is removed from the bone is its surface, and remaining in it are roughnesses and subtle imperfections: then you must smooth out that roughness, and remove those delicate imperfections with fine rasps, from which you have prepared quantities of various sizes. You should be able to apply them more appropriately in every place according to what they lead you towards, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it must be that you administer according to your reason, which corresponds to the initial preparation of the bone with a larger rasp.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use something finer afterwards.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to perform this until you reach the point of applying them thinner and finer among all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every remaining narrow or small crack and fracture, it is necessary to apply care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and stands above what we wrote and showed in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If the fatty tissue is detected and retained when you remove the wound: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the quantity of the wounds, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do whatever is easiest for you to do above this, so that no scab forms.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then place a broad bandage above it and do not tighten it, except to the extent that it holds the wound only: and remove it with this care on one day or two days until you are safe from the heat.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it and apply after that medicines with which there is an excess of dryness: such as roots of lilies, and the flour of herbs, and ashes, and aristolochia, and similar ones: and it is good to make a powder from these medicines that can be applied like powders on wounds.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply all medicine which has the property of cleansing without biting it.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And caution according to your ability, so that the wound under your care is clear: neither let there be a foul smell from the ointment nor dirt.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not let the poison accumulate completely within it at all: because when the poison accumulates on the brain tissue, it corrupts and spoils it, and a great mischief happens afterwards to the weak one. And now a scab forms over the head, when it is cleaned from him, especially when his care is neglected, and blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	So consider this then, if such things happen to the weak that we said, you will know that it is very harmful beyond doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackening does not happen, unless it is from medicine that is placed upon him, and this works according to the power of that medicine, so as to create that blackening: then you should take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and mix these with cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place him over the abscess: afterwards care for him with suitable treatments until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ For restoration when the nose is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that it is only the two upper parts of the nose or one of them that gets broken because there are two bones in it: because what is below it is cartilage and does not break easily, unless rubbed against something or bent, etc.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of its nose breaks, then you should put a few fingers into the nostril opening and apply pressure with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape. This must be done skillfully and with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, so that through your action no additional pain is caused to the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the break is in the upper part of the nose and fingers cannot reach it, then you should adjust or align the thin thickness at the end of the radius, where there's a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the break is in two parts, then do something similar to that: and proceed with its restoration on the first day after the break occurred, if it's possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, apply hot baths in peace.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a linen cloth at the end of the nose if the break is in one part. Or insert two cloths if the break is in both parts. The thickness of the linen should fill the nostril opening to capacity.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be infused with liquorice in butter and change every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	And yet, I do not seem to think that it is right; rather, it seems necessary that liquorice be infused in flour water, after it has been made with miller's powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let the liquorice go until the mouth becomes firm and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And at other times, a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of liquorice, after a soft cloth has been placed over it: and what happens is that this holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and so as not to hinder the sick from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this matter is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that: and if you wish, do liquorice.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	And if the nose happens to get hot during your operation on a boil, plaster it with camphor, or with oil of rose infused in oil, or moderately from myrrh water.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	And if it does not happen that the boil gets hot, then it is necessary to plaster him with millet flour and powdered rue mixed with flour water.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft wadding on it, and do not bind the nose at all with anything.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	And if the bones of the nose are broken in a slight fracture or crumble, then it is necessary to cut over them and extract them with suitable instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then treat the incision, and take care of what is fleshed out with it and consolidated by suitable plasters, or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	And if there happens to be a cut in the middle of the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with liquorice and use a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the break does not coincide with a bone: then observe if there is only an external break of it, and it is not fractured into two parts, and it bends towards the insides. Then its knowledge becomes easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the break is in the right part of it, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth: similarly, if the break is in the left jaw, then insert your right hand's index finger. And push with it the lumpiness of the break upwards from inside with ease towards the outside using your other hand from the inside part of the bone. And make it equal to that.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	And if the break of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then you should administer extension from both parts according to straightness until such time as an equilibrium can be achieved.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	And if shaking or breakage already occurs in the teeth: then bind those of which you hope will remain with gold thread, or silver thread, or hair.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place the saw over the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a folded cloth, and then place over the cloth a large star-shaped piece of skin or an equal fragment of the sole skin, according to the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it again from above, according to the preparation you have for its binding and its fitting applies until it is not destroyed. And instruct your patient to eat with calmness and restfulness, and give him a gentle diet.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	And if you think that some alteration has occurred to the figure with any method: then hurry up and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct that which has been altered from it, and apply the plaster made from mill flour, mixed with alum or from sesame flour, after you have scraped off the knife wound; and place upon the plaster soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While therefore the added plaster remains on top of it, and does not alter the position of the bone, remove it, do not break it until it is healed: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	Indeed, this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile an abscess occurs, then apply the thing that we said to be applied many times during its healing, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with an open wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	When the bone fragment is no longer attached to the bone or from pus: then carefully consider this, so as to remove that fragment of pus along with what suits you for their removal from the tools.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if there is a tight opening in the wound, then widen it with a bloodletting instrument according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have drained off the pus and nothing remains from it, or then if there is still an opening in the wound: and if it isn't large, place over it that which suits among the plasters for this, and allow it to heal until it has healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ For the restoration of the Furca, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Furca is broken mainly from the anterior part of the humerus, and its fracture occurs according to one of three methods.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or the Furca is broken and separated into two parts, beyond which pus may occur: and it is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	And thus, what happens in bone extraction: it is harder for restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	And thus, what occurs is a fracture accompanied by pus.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And in such an operation when there is a fracture without pus, proceed as follows: you should have two assistants present. One of them holds the assistant that follows the broken bone with its support, and the other extends their neck towards the injured part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then, when you have reduced the fracture with your fingers until its shape is restored, adjust it according to need; and there should be neither prominence nor depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place a small spherical ball under the prosthesis, made of cloth or wool. Its size should be according to your needs: extend and lift the Furca, then squeeze the ball with your hand until you have equalized the fracture as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the extremity of the Furca to the outside: because it has reached deeply, then you should have the patient lie down on their neck. And place a cylindrical cushion in the middle under his shoulder blade and have your assistant press against his shoulder blade downwards until the deepest part of the Furca's mouth rises upwards. Then straighten and equalize the fracture with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel dislocation from the Furca and it moves: then you should place your hand over it and remove the dislocation with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use your ingenuity in making an incision with one of the teeth you prepared for this purpose. After placing under the Furca an instrument that holds the tip, and this instrument can be made from wood or metal.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is assimilated to the cochlea which does not have a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width according to that which you need it from the size of the bone, and its adequacy.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	As for its length, even according to what is possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And may it have two ends, as you see: and let one end be broad, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if the break with the wounds that you made when you extracted the bone splinter is broad and is secured by a hot plaster: then bind two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the break is small, or you fear a pus pocket: then fill the wound with bandages and grains according to the size of the cut on the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	But if pus occurs with a hot pocket, then soak the cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	However, when there is a narrowing of the bone without a wound, and without division, it is as if you placed over the bone plaster made from mill flour mixed with dried urine.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft balm on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its nipple if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the hemonema, that is, a rod which the Saracens hold, which should be very long: and its width should be of one hand or roughly so.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled grain on top of the balm and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an aster from a thin tablet, whose width should be three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then envelop her in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then envelop him with a cloth and a stick at the site of Alhazmi, which falls over the fracture area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place Alhazmi over the fracture as it is done, and envelop her above his neck, and under a healthy bump, and under an infirm bump: and put her across every part, and in such a way that you see which compression holds the fracture together at its proper place: and this thing should not be hidden from you, and all of it, so that no stick is removed from the mouth of the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you must observe the sick every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever then the ligament softens, and you see the stick already being removed; then straighten this, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick's pillow under his back, and put a small portion of the night's pulvinar under his healthy bump, at night, so that when he wakes up, it removes his supporting aid from beside him.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the rib fracture is raised through the elevation of the shoulder blade.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not release the ligament if no accident occurs from itching or it detaches up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the compression and release him until he heals and clots.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	The rib fracture is indeed compressed and strengthened for the most part within twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some individuals to a lesser extent.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ Concerning the restoration of the fractured bone using a spatula.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula break, and especially not in its broadest part; they do not break from it except at its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	So when it breaks from that place and breaks right through its middle, and this cannot be seen except by touch; then according to the figure of the break attempt preparation of it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And place her under the natural figure in every way possible with your ingenuity, which is within you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the area mill powder mixed with flour, and a soft plaster, and then place above that some powder from doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a broad piece of thin board according to the size of the spatula or make it slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if under the board there is a hollow in any part of the spatula, then equal that hollow with soft plaster until the board descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind above with hemp string in a length appropriate to the constrictiveness and firmness of the board, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And examine the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the bandage softens, tighten it again, and readjust the board if it has moved from its place: and let the sick person lie on their healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	The spatula is indeed restored within twenty days, or within twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number has been completed, then release the bandage: and you may be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For that is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If it proceeds from a fragment of bone and pierces under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we have said about the fracture of the humerus from heat-induced inflammation, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ On the restoration of the rib fracture.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of its own, and it is rare for this to happen.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The ends of it do indeed break and fragment from accidents involving it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it breaks in the middle, which inclines downwards, and a sudden pain occurs to it, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps blood is vomited out, and the curvature of the broken bone is made known, and is not hidden from touch. The restoration of it is for him to be laid on his sickbed with his back to the wall, and place the spoons under its armpits.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press the ribs and unite the ribs from both sides or along the edges with hands: and adjust the curvature of his body according to every manner that is possible until the shape of the bone returns, as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then put a plaster and suppurative dressing on it, and put an upper layer of a star from a thin board made of willow or ash, and similar materials after you have enclosed it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then adjust the binding over the broken bone so it doesn't move and proceed with the binding according to its roundness on a few occasions, and tighten as appropriate.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it. If necessity causes him to have a sensation of itching or corrosion in that spot, or pain or inflammation, then proceed, release it, and remove the plaster, correcting whatever occurs according to the manner of its healing.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then remove the dressing if you see it going towards that face: and attach a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Regarding the restoration of ribs, when they break.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that the breaking of ribs does not happen unless in the fleshy areas following the back, and from the ends thereof away from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen due to friction with them, for this reason, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	The knowledge of which can be discerned by touch during the examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of this is carried out in such a way that an equal break with fingers according to the possible method until it matches the shape as it should.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply the dressing, and bind the broken mouth with splints if that is necessary for it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the breaking of ribs is downwards towards the insides: then it happens to a patient with sudden pain and punctures, just like that puncture which happens to one who has pleurisy; because the mouth pierces the skin and also this difficulty in breathing occurs, along with coughing, and vomiting of blood much: and this is difficult treatment.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were ingenious in this with many devices: and among them are those who say that you should give foods to patients who produce inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly inflames, expands, and is pushed by the breaking towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however abhor to make a cause for quickly doing a hot blister if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	And if it has already happened, then adds it in there.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a suction be placed on the spot, then suck with strength, and it is similar to this reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, there is fear that the suction might attract excess fluids to the location because of the weakening arrangement.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has already been submerged in warm oil: and let there be small stones placed between the ribs until it is filled; so that when you remove the bandage according to the roundness, it will be a balanced bandage.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	And then, the sick person is cared for with convalescent care, from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	And if the sick person is restricted in some way that they cannot bear, and their mouth stings or is pierced by a puncture wound, and we fear for the sick: then it is necessary to cut open the place and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	And then place the instrument on it that preserves sawing, as its description preceded this: and insert the mouth with ease, and make the incision.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	And then let us unite both lips to the wound if it is large with stitches: and we will care for it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	And if during this time a hot abscess occurs, then quickly approach, and pour the small stones in oil of rose color over it, and place it on the spot: and let the sick person be cared for with what suits the treatment of the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	And meanwhile, it is also covered on the side where he sleeps until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	¶ For the restoration of the fracture of the thoracic and cervical vertebrae.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, the neck bones sometimes suffer from fractures and rarely due to friction; and similarly with the thoracic vertebrae.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore such a thing happens to someone, and one wishes to know whether they will heal or not heal, then trust.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see his hands already softened and stunned, and dead, and unable to move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you squeeze them with your fingers, and prick them with a sharp point, they do not feel it and do not feel pain in them: then know that he will not heal, and in many postures it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	And if he moves them and feels constriction with his fingers and the prick, then you know that the neck bones are saved, and that the sick will heal with healing.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	And if it happens that there is a similarity to the ribs of the Spondylus in this person, and you wish to know whether he will also heal or not: then examine his feet. Then if you see that they are softened, and something happens to them as happens in hands: then when lying on his back, wind and weakness come out without desire; and when he rolls onto his belly, weakness comes out without desire; and when he rolls onto his back and wants to eat, but cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, there should be no difficulties in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if nothing like that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment that happens from this is to take the application of hot mustard baths: do so by placing on the Spondylus crushed rose oil only, or with eggs boiled and seasoned.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that on it several times a day until the hot lump subsides. Then place one part of the therapeutic plasters on the spot, which dry and tighten, and bind it with a bandage over it: and advise the sick person to use it quietly and in peace.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Let not one sleep over a limb where he has found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	And if it happens during the rubbing of the bone's suture, or when something is already separated from it: then one must separate above the skin and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join the two lips over the wound, if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Next, care for it with some meaty substance from an ointment until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If however the last bone breaks and is at the end of the tail: then you must insert your left hand's thumb into the anus, and with your other hand, equalize the broken bone as much as possible, and do so again equally.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it over it, and remove it: and care for the wound with the preceding treatment until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ On the restoration of the anus.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones of the anus break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break, then their fracture is not a clean break, but rather a crushing at the ends of them: and they split longitudinally and tend to bend towards the insides. And sickness causes pain in that spot and a puncture: and the broken leg stands out.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And indeed, its restoration is to extend your hand over it until you're placed over the fracture as much as the shape of the break allows.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	And if the fracture is only at the ends of it, then equalize that break according to how you are prepared from an equation, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	And if the fracture is longitudinal or already bends towards the insides, then have the sick person lie on their belly until you prepare for restoring that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have made her equal, place a plaster over her: then place over her a shield from wood or from skin; and tie the bandage in such a way that you do not fear displacement of the fracture nor removal of the shield.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of them with that which fills her up until she takes it in the bandage according to equality. And instruct the patient to sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however an abscess arises hot: then cease from stretching and his recovery, until the hot abscess settles down: and place over it what settles down as it is, according to how has preceded, then return to his recovery: and tie it up as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it happens inside the bone, or if there is a breakage, extract.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Guide for the Healing of Fractures by the Helper
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The helper is this instrument that exists between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of these methods is: to take a flat piece of wood with medium thickness, according to this shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from an elevated place, and the patient sits on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then the broken arm is moved onto the log until it reaches its shoulder joint, where a curvature of the wood is attached in the middle.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above it so that the attendant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician adjusts the fracture with his hands until the fracture returns, according to what is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	Another method is for the invalid to be put on top of his own neck: and one should suspend his hand from his own neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then instruct two attendants, one of them to hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and let the other hold below him, and each shall extend towards their own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want a stronger extension, then grip under the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another; and each of the two attendants should extend towards their own two parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is close to the end of the arm, then you must place one bandage under the elbow and another under the fracture towards the bend of the forearm.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly, if the fracture is close to the bend of the elbow: then you must place a bandage over that area, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then adjust the fracture smoothly without effort until when the fracture has been adjusted according to what is necessary, and a good application has been applied: then grip it if no warm pus occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a warm pus occurs, then release the grip until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on it wool that has soaked up pus in vinegar and rose oil until when the pus ceases: then grip it; and the right way to grip it is to place plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put an inversion from new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then secure the arm above the support, and place his hand open on his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and tie it over the assistant arm, so that the arm stands in the place of the stars: if nothing prevents you from him, nor let anything come to you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	And if there is something that causes you to change from what comes to you from the broken bone, then use the stars: and it is as when you place a star over the fracture; which shall be wider and stronger than all other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place the width of each finger between all the stars; and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture, adding three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie (it) over the stars with the constriction that I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your constriction should be tighter than the place of the fracture itself.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as much more the fracture stretches, let the constriction be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	And if you see the placement of the stars and the constriction, as we said, during the hour when you are restoring your limb, then do this: and if you fear heat (indicating healing), then release the constriction and all the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	And then examine the ligament on all three days, so that there is no occurrence of itching, or swelling, or food being prevented from reaching the limb due to the position of the surplus constriction.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So adjust that whole thing according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	And if you place your trust in that, so that nothing happens from it: then do not release the ligament unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back and have his hands on his stomach: and place an evenly full wool bag under the assistant's arm.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider every hour of night or day, so that the figure of the broken limb is not restored, or the ligament softens.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct that whole thing by your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place the food for the sick according to the order we have prescribed, so that the food is subtle first until the mouth starts to grip it: then it will be necessary to thicken their food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	Indeed, the custom of supporting and leg is that it is to be gripped for forty days: so then it should be relieved, and bathing administered, and treated with ointment which corrects that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul and rubbed, then do not relieve it from that ligament and stick until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	¶ Concerning the restoration of a humerus fracture.
Caput XIII.	Title XII
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones which are named the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is smaller: and this is what follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and this is what is placed under the smaller one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps then only the larger humerus fractures, or the smaller one: and perhaps they both break.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	So when only the smaller humerus fractures above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower humerus fractures, it has a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	So if the bone that breaks is the smaller humerus above, then it is appropriate for the doctor during its restoration to apply a gentle and modest extension until it is properly aligned.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If a large easy incision is made where there has been a fracture, then it is necessary that he place a stronger tightness greatly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he depict the position of the hand at the time of his restoration, and the extension of his own stretched out over the patient.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let there be a joint at the end of all the fingers: or else if there are remains, have them ready. Let the patient sit square to themselves, and place the pillow in front of him, or directly under him, at his height, so that the patient does not incur unnecessary labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with the ligament.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant shall extend it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor will adjust the mouth until he can reduce him according to the better figure that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	And if there are cavities in the fracture of bones, then try to reduce all fragments to their place with your force.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If it appears that a separate sliver is present, and the skin is punctured, and there is no hope for his restoration: then place yourself over him, and cut him according to the manner we spoke about in those which were mentioned beforehand.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already made a separate chapter about that, so take care of its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	And if a warm blister occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then cover him with a cloth made from camphorated oil and white wax, and have it be medium between thickness and fineness. And tie the cloth tightly over him until the blister settles: then remove the camphor, and apply prepared plaster made of powdered cornmeal mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place stars, and let there be a star placed somewhat wider above the fracture itself, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether there is a fracture in one bone or in two bones at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your tightening over the fracture site stronger and more intensely, a little more with the tightening towards the upper fracture or below it: or place a softer tightening about as much as its own tightening, according to what was recalled at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be bandages that cover the fracture, soft and damp bandages: and let them not be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread with which to tighten, made of linen properly, midway between fine and thick, as we have told.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And examine the member and ligament after a day.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	And if anything should happen that requires correction, such as itching in the member: then it is necessary to immerse the member with heated water until that itching subsides, and remove the unbound member until it subsides, then repeat the tightening.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	And if the tightening has already softened and the wound is removed, and similar circumstances arise: then correct that entire thing with your force and reconsider.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to the excess of tightening, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat and let it rest for a few days until its nourishment comes back, then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	And if none of the things we said happen to a weak person, then it is not necessary for them to be released until after twenty days, or roughly around that time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then let the patient's hand be suspended from their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its neck be equal, and let it be protected by its strength from being disturbed.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this kind of fracture heals within thirty days, or within thirty-two days; and perhaps it will heal even within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	That is the whole thing according to the principles of humors and the principles of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	¶ On the Healing of Fractures, Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that an injury to the wrist and joints of the fingers rarely results in fracture.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it doesn't happen to him unless there is multiple rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	So when a fracture of the sole or due to rubbing occurs, then the patient should be seated with their back straight and have a seat facing them on the same level.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand over it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the servant extends the fractured bones, and the doctor equalizes them until they join properly.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it must be that he applies plaster and paste, if no warm pus occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the poultice above according to the size of the area: and you have already enclosed it in linen.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is somewhat below the middle of the sole, then make a similar sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to press it over her fractured sole with her foot: then bind it with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And use the poultice made from a skin that has softness, so that it adheres to the skin of the sole: and bind it according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is external, then it must be: you place a splint above and another one from below at the foot: and let your hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a bandage, as the hand is turned: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	And if a fracture happens to the nodes of some fingers, then if it's the thumb, it is adjusted according to what is needed.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it should be tightened with the sole of the foot: and if you like, place a flat straight splint on it, so that the fracture is lifted up and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is to other fingers such as the middle finger and index finger, or the little finger and ring finger, then it should be aligned and bound with a healthy following digit, or they are all bound according to continuity: which is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a flat splint on it, as we said about the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And when restoring yourself, and after that arrangement, apply a warm bath: and oppose whatever is needed when something comes from it, according to its narration.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ Concerning the restoration of a thigh fracture.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The thigh bone is often broken and its severity can be felt because it turns towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done like this: you tighten the ligament above the fracture and another ligament underneath the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient is laid down on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then each supporting ligament is extended to its part according to equality: and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If it is a fracture close to the root of the thigh bone, then there should be a ligament attached to the pectineal part, so that its extension goes upwards: and another ligament under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if it is a fracture close to the knee, then there should be a ligament close to the knee, so that its extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon holds both the jaws with his hands until he reduces it according to the likeness of the natural figure; and the mouth is joined by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply plaster and bandaging, if no abscess occurs on the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then let him rest for a few days until the hot abscess settles, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandaging of it should be done as follows.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to apply over the fracture an outer hard one, that is, a bandage: and double it twice or three times; and there remains excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then apply the leg, until the heel reaches to the root of birth.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the thigh bone and the leg near the knee downwards, and let the ends of the thread reach from the upper part of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the leg and thigh that remains excess from the abscess.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the thigh bone at the site of its own fracture points, and place one of these points over the mouth of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the gaps between the thigh and the leg with soft bandages so that the bandaging is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then start with strong bandaging over the site of the fracture in three revolutions or four, from the middle.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you extend with the ligament from the breakage site, the tighter your fit becomes and the softer it is, becoming gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	And then direct yourself towards both ends of the thread which you inserted between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	So, bind with three stars from above for each one.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	And then proceed with both ends of the thread to the lower parts until you reach the stone of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And also pull both ends of the stars from the other side; so that the ligament does not move out of its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	And then release the tension on that, while it remains in place, so that there does not occur erosion to the member, nor pustule formation, nor swelling and similar occurrences.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	And if anything occurs from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, when addressing the issue and rectify whatever happens there according to what we have often said.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If indeed there is a fragment of bone inside the bone that might irritate: then it should be necessary to make an equal one, if it's possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if that is not possible, cover it up and remove it; and care for the one after whom your reminder comes until he heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this breakage of the hip is bound, besides adding stars to it, as we said in the helper and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	But when it comes to restoring him after such a breakage, weakness does not cause lameness.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if he is restored alone, besides what is applied to his other leg, then it will be necessary for that one who is affected by lameness to always remain so.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you will know that the thigh is bound for fifty days, either it gets added a little or it gets reduced a little. All this varies according to the diversity of constitutions and other arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	About the restoration of dislocation in the knee joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that dislocation of the knee joint is rare to fracture, but it happens due to repeated rubbing.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed dislocation causes a fracture, then it is either a crack or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this happens with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands on that whole thing together with the sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of such is conducted in this manner: it balances what was disrupted from its parts with the fingers until they are collected and joined as much as possible according to balance and ease, and construction allow.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made from millet flour or cornmeal mixed with egg white: and place a round piece of leather over it if you need one; and bind this conveniently above to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements we have described in other fractures: such as a hot poultice and similar things: so that you can oppose each accident with what suits him until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	About the restoration of dislocation in the thigh.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones in the thigh (Crurus), one of which is larger and named as such. The other is finer and is called the Patella.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that each of the two types of fractures that occur in both bones as well as in the arm bones: thus, its restoration is done similarly to the restoration of the arm bones, and there is one operation for both.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at once, the leg turns towards all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a finer bone is broken, the leg turns towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thicker bone is broken, you find that it is lower: and there are things among them which do not hide themselves from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and equate, and the star ligations according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many (issues): let there be a greater extension and gentler ligation on your part.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed in the leg there is something more than in the arm from operation: and it is that when you equalize the stars and complete all your operation, then take two bandages from the wood of pine which are administered in the construction of solar devices placed under the slats; and they are made from palm splints. And choose from them those that have a small thickness and are not coarse, and let them not be from the finer ones: and their length should match the length of the leg from the knee to the lower part.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then roll each band over twice in two foldings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg from one side, and the other part from the other side: and let them extend from knee to foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then ligate two bandages at three places, at each of the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when restriction is prohibited, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed, a womb may now be administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and it should be placed in it so as to preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed much needs to be done when you are dealing with a wound properly during a fracture.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then daily examine the limb for every day, and be diligent with that diligence even at its last stages from dislocation, or inflation, or other similar conditions.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then anything of those happens, then oppose it with what needs to be opposed until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Regarding the fracture of feet bones and digits.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Indeed, a complete fracture does not occur to the heel bone.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fractures do occur to the bones of the foot and somewhat to digits as well. And they do not occur to them except through rubbing in various dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs to the foot bones and you see those bones rise up over themselves against each other, then the sick person should place their foot on a prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and place your foot on what rises from those bones. Afterwards press it, or heel that part: and adjust it until it returns to its original position.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply plaster and poultice above it: and place under the foot a thin table with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it together with the foot to a suitable tightness. After you have removed that with the sheets and all else it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When then three days or four have passed for him, then unfasten the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find bones aligned, whether they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is therefore as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any fingers are broken, then restore them and adjust them as I have instructed you regarding the restoration of fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Next, place a stone on your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than that. Then place this board under the foot as I have told you, and tighten it to an appropriate constriction.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however what is broken consists of two or three, or more bones, then place a stone of the appropriate size on each digit, wrapped in linen cloth: and tighten the board under the lower foot: and let it stand above one of the table's corners outside the belly of the foot, so that it may hold the retention well.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is incumbent upon you not to forget to consider all that I have told you about other fractures due to the accidents we mentioned, and match each accident with what needs to be done.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	### On Fractures of the Hipbone in Women, and the Sternum Bones, and the Rod-like Bone in Men.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the hipbone of a woman is broken, then have her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards the back part of her own body slightly and keep it behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife fills the woman's hip with sand until it fills her completely: and make it so that the hip becomes like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be squeezed, and the back of her is raised gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	That's why you have to remove the sand until it reaches in front of the door of the hip like a sphere, and the broken opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When then he wishes to withdraw, let him remove it with ease, then let him drink; and let him return himself according to the manner in which you introduced yourself into him initially: then let him return towards his food first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let that be done for seven days, or roughly around the time, because the mouth is restored indeed.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you desire it, take the scrotum and hold on to the hole of its funnel by a reed tube, and insert the whole bladder into his vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow through the tube with force until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for it will break.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill with fat and let stand for several days, as we have told you, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the mouth of the male or female is broken by the stumps of the Pectinis, then administer in its restoration and with its own equilibrium, that which we told you about in the bone of Anchae.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby breaks which happen rarely, especially for someone who has some interest or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	Understand my book well because this fracture indicates to you a way of doing things straight and correct in its restoration and tightening. Therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the Anser's bone (most likely referring to the bone of the thigh or leg) breaks in a man, take hold of its hollow and insert it into him.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place upon him the healing from the cloth and it is healed and released after three days or roughly that time, and it will be cured if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	¶ Concerning the restoration of bone fractures, when they occur with wounds.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is necessary for him who encounters a fracture near a bone node, especially if it's large like the hip joint or those assisting joints or similar to them, that he quickly provides with a bloodletting instrument: if you are told about the conditions of bloodletting as we previously instructed.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If bleeding occurs from the bone node, then you must hurry to perform its removal, so that you powder it with a ground substance as we instructed: if there is not something else present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then start the restoration of the fracture on the same day: and do not delay this task if there is no wound formed.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed it happens that there is a warm wound, then postpone the restoration until the seventh day, until the wound settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth day either, for you will cause him to experience bad events by doing so.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the fractured bone is protruding above the skin: then you should attempt to reduce it, and level it with your hands with ease and slight stretching.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If the extension of it and its leveling by your hands is not prepared: then reduce it with this tool.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the tool is made of iron, its length being seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of wounds.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of this, it is necessary for the doctor to take three, or four according to their need for any species of fracture treatment, out of them.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round. And there should be a slight thickness within it so that it does not fold upon itself during pressure application at the time of operation. And let its ends be sharp, with borders on their ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part extend to the thickness from the middle of it up to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the pointedly curved end of it above the protruding end of the bone, and push them together alternately until when the bone returns and becomes equal to some equation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to make the ends of the fracture equal to each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the broken ends of it are thin and do not accept the tool well through bending, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the tool has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If however you cannot reduce them with what we have told you to do altogether, then cut it with the tool that suits it from the Cutters as we said: or saw it with any one of your saws in a way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then grind what remains in the bone from its roughness and fine cortical fragments.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	Therefore, when the bone is reduced and a severe pain is felt after its reduction by an inexperienced person, you will know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	So do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great benefit to the weak person when your restoration task on bones is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in a strong, dark wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it's during summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place any metal over the wound, nor anything that contains oil: so as to prevent it from causing putrefaction and decay within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer garlic at the time of completion of your bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And remove the discovered wound: thus, you will create an opening with needles according to the amount of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be cautious at all times, do not tighten the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For indeed, many stupid doctors have done this: and caused either death or decay, or corruption, or disease to happen to their sick patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your tension be soft, gentle, and different from the tensions of the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is evil, or if it's a large wound and you fear some bad incidents which we told, and you find pain in the hanging place: then it should not be that you put stars above it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make involutions from hard cloths at the place of the stars, and tighten it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	And when a day or two later, and you see that the wound has begun to heal, causing pus to form within it: then remove the cloth you placed on top of it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer licorice and apply the ointments we usually use to heal wounds: such as the tetrapharmaceutical ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it will be fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every morning and evening until it has consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it should be prepared in such a way that the member will drain pus downwards easily from it.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	And if many days pass and the wound does not consolidate, nor is the pus removed from it, then you will know that there are small openings in those bones.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	For it is necessary that you inquire about the wound when you are touching it.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	I want those from among them which are separated by a distance, remove them and extract that one itself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of them are not separated and pierce the body, causing pain to occur, try to penetrate those and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that the wound is torn or split open, that is, infected or another form of decay and putrefaction: then you should oppose each one of them with what suits it from treatment, which was previously described in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this point where my discourse should stand and when you make your current thought clear to yourself as the mouth breaks and extends over the body, such as in the case of the thigh bone and its supports, similar conditions on larger body parts: do not mistake its pull, for it often leads to death. Instead, let it be until it decays; then you may dispose of it.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off on its own after twenty days or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	So then, attend to the wound if it appears to you; and if not, dispose of it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	¶ On the treatment of nodulation during inquiry about a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This nodulation happens many times during the inquiry for healing of fractures.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Primarily, it is that which is close to the sutures: and from this, the member's figure becomes broken.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the member from its natural action or operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore consider when it is a recent nodulation: administer medicines that promote coagulation in it, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, carrion wax, and acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, whether you take some of these or all of them, and destroy them with wine that has been boiled, or with egg white, or with vinegar, and place them on the knot in a poultice, and tie them tightly onto it with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And remove the bandage, do not leave it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then解开it, and apply another one, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tie a sheet of tin in the middle over it instead.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing whatever is feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the knot has already turned into a stone and is bound up tight, and necessity hastens its provocation for removal: then apply over her from above, and cut off the projecting excess. Or shave it with some razors until it is removed, and take care of that until she is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	¶ Concerning the treatment when recovery occurs and the member remains afterwards in a subtle way that deviates from its natural state.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the break of a bone has been restored and the member remains afterwards in a subtle way that is weak: then this does not happen except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is that there are many solutions and bindings of the ligament not according to what should be done: or because of an excess of bandage tension until nutrition is prevented from flowing to the member; or because of an excess amount of ointment applied at the wrong time: or because of a lack of blood in the body of the sick, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for that is to nourish the sick body and make it tender until blood multiplies in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer baths.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place the morsel on the member: so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply the application of its ointment with warm water until it brings nourishment and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	¶ On the treatment of fractures when they are being restored, especially those that are crooked or twisted.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member has already been restored after its healing and shows the crookedness or elevation of a fractured bone, or a knot, and is damaged due to this condition but still allows natural functioning of the limb: in such cases, it is not necessary for those who think that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And many obstinate doctors and restorers have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And indeed, this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, in order that it might be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	However, if the limpness and knot are recent: then it should be treated with warm water containing soothing herbs such as the leaves of the hawthorn, its root, and yellow rocket, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make him a poultice with a soothing plaster such as one made of chalk and water.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or use the mucus of the hawthorn root and mix it with chicken fat or safflower oil; then apply it as a poultice.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or the fat of many figs and treated with myrrh of a pigeon's dung, or similar things mentioned in medicines that reduce fixation, they are applied.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes a knot is resolved with frequent, old, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movements of the member are administered to every part at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however curvature has already prevailed and made itself strong, turning into a stone, and necessity for its treatment with iron has been provoked: then it is necessary that the upper part of it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be dissolved, and what protrudes from the knot or bone be removed with fine cutting instruments: and ease should be administered in this matter with concern and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	¶ On speaking about dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is the departure of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is forbidden by its motion, and the shape of the member is ruined.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes accidents to happen upon the weak, pains, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	So when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten its restoration: it does not completely delay it.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if the treatment is delayed, the position may become fixed and possibly with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, one should not move or stretch during the period of stiffness, lest it fix that position and possibly the reduction of the dislocation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because many times it causes spasms and painful injuries to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	However, when this happens, then you must hasten towards bloodletting for the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is released until the lump subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is soaked with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then let it be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every member is cured with it, where its mention will come to its own place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	Indeed, I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even according to what precedes in fractures, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the care of the inferior mandible dislocation.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	Dislocations of the two mandibles occur rarely, not often.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	Dislocation of the jaw happens according to one or two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or indeed, they are moved from their places by a slight movement and are made somewhat soft.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely by a full dislocation until the saliva softens down to part of the chest, until it can soothe the sick person, and they cannot hold it, nor can they close their mouth, and the tongue is enclosed with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however her dislocation is slight, then it returns in various states through herself with little force.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete, then it must be treated with urgency and not delayed completely: and it should have someone hold the head of the sick person. And the doctor should insert his finger of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw bone inside their mouth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert both of his thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of his hand fingers shall be outside, with which he balances.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to clean their jaws and moisten them so they can eat everywhere.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor adjusts the jaw, and drives the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	And if the reduction of it is difficult, especially when both jaws are involved: then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of the jaws becomes easy. Do not completely neglect the reduction of the jaws, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	And when they return and are adjusted, and the mouth of the patient is closed, and does not soften: then place upon them linen wadding with a candle made from wax, and oil that has been mixed.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound with ease using soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on his back: and let his head be supported between two wadding pieces, so that he does not move himself to the right or left: nor let him try, or be made to chew anything: instead, give him a soft drink for sustenance until when the pains disappear and the jaw is set: then let him eat whatever he wishes, and let it be given to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	And do not exert himself over the operation on his mouth during agitation and drink, and shaking, until the jaw is set, and he is healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	And if the reduction of both jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at any hour and do not return to their places: then fevers and frequent vomiting often occur. And perhaps the patient's stomach is relieved, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	And when you see that: then you will know it is a loss, and he who experiences that often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	¶ Concerning the reduction of dislocations of the scapula and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Head XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula indeed does not dislocate from the intrinsic side because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates to the external part: and that is demonstrated by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is for the invalid to lie on his back and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then, force the place with your palm's strong pressure, for it will return to its original position.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Next, place on her some plaster and ointment, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, the ends which follow the elbow and continue with it do not dislocate unless rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	Which does sometimes dislocate on a certain day: then it must be reduced and readjusted according to what we have said and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Next, place over it plaster, ointment, and bandaging.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the patient to remain calm and still until they recover.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it has also been separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ On the Reduction of Dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Head XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus does not dislocate, unless it does so in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is for it to dislocate towards the lower part of the capitulum.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second way is for it to dislocate towards the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it may dislocate towards the upper part of the humerus: that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated towards the back, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated towards the front, due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed, it is dislocated and comes down towards the tip below; primarily in those where there is little flesh.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it leaves them quickly and enters them quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those however where there is much flesh, it behaves contrary to that, namely because it leaves with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people due to a blow or accident, and the humerus is pushed out of joint by heat treatment, and this is considered because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, you should experience that until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	Dislocation is known when it occurs towards the back of the tip; and you can distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	You will find a clear difference between them, and you discover the concavity in the head of the humerus, and under the tip at touch, as if it were hard: and the sick person cannot bring their hand to their ear nor move it with any movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	Similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, then you will find a clear palpation that is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this type of dislocation is easy when it is recent, or if the person is a sick child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	The reduction involves lifting their own hand to above.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under their tip and raise the joint with strength to above to its place: and the helper lifts their hand and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place her lower, for he comes quickly himself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however he does not return through that which we said, and there are days from the beginning where a dislocation occurs: then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water, and an application should be given that softens and soothes, just as if they were decocting tall roots, and fennel, and bee's milk plant in water, and it should be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should be repositioned on his back: and a ball and wool should be placed under his nipples, which should be equal in softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place his heel on the ball and elevate the shoulder blade with force, and draw the patient's hand down.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant should hold the head of the patient so that it does not move downwards; for he comes immediately back.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if possible, reduce him according to this manner: and make it so that the present man is longer than the patient, and stands at the side part, and inserts his shoulder blade under the nipple of the patient: and lift the nipple of the doctor upwards until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant should pull the hand of the patient downwards towards the lower part of his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the patient is light: then it is necessary to have something else suspend him with, in order to cool him down: for the dislocation comes immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood is made to stand in the ground with its head being a round shape: like the handle of a mortar: which should not be too thick or too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place something under the patient after placing some soft cloth on top of his head: and let the patient stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then extend his hand to the lower parts up from one side, and extend his body from the other part with strength; for the union returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If it proves difficult to return him through all of what we have said, then use this care: take a piece of wood whose length is the measure of two arms and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers; let there be a round head on it, so that its entry into the deep notch can be facilitated according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then, gentle cloths are tied over the round head, so as not to harm the fragile wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place it under the notch of the patient, so that the hand or arm extends over the wood until the lower parts: and tie the wood over the support and arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the step of the ladder across its width, and extend the hand to the lower parts, and let the rest of the body suspended drop from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the union enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	And when its entry has been completed according to whatever possible model: then it is necessary that you place under the notch a sphere of equal quantity made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made from mill flour with myrrh and egg white, covering the entire shoulder as it would be turned upwards.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind under the notch a suitable constriction: and let the ligament be wound over the plaster as it would be turned upwards; and connect his hand to its neck, and let him go, without moving his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that there be little food for the patient until the member strengthens, because this leads to a faster healing of him.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then it should be replaced after seven days, or five, and it should be removed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it therefore hardens and does not soften, then he is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If however the stitch is dislocated many times, due to moisture that happens to it or because of another cause: then one should apply with the cautery into that place with three holes, as was mentioned in the chapter about cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is done entirely, and the ligament is released after seven days, and the stitch does not harden, and the plaster and compression are applied to it repeatedly and do not harden, and fall off, and cannot be lifted up to higher places: then you will know that the nerves which go to the shoulder blade have been cut or stretched or softened. And you will know that the stitch never sets in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The dislocation that occurs towards the chest and nipples, or towards the back, is corrected with a push and extension using the hands: until it returns to its place. Then all other compression and care should be applied, until healing takes place.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement, then use the invalid for bathing frequently, until that heaviness is alleviated, and returns to its natural first state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	§ On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty. It is truly dislocated in all directions, but particularly towards the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And you will not fail to notice its dislocation: for it is visible and touchable, regardless of whatever shape it may take when dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it is made clear to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	Indeed, the joint of the injury prevents the arm from being able to bend, nor can it touch with its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must hasten to set the dislocation immediately before a boil forms from heat.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it happens that there forms on him a boil from heat, his reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps he will not be completely cured, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	Indeed, it is worse for all types of dislocations and the pain from them is more intense: and often death follows with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And when restoration is possible from those things that can be reduced, it is to extend his hand with both hands: and let his arm be extended, and the doctor's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he impels the joint with the thumbs of his own hands at the same time, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is towards the front: then he returns in such a way that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until it hits with the base of his palm the dislocated elbow.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	But if the dislocation does not comply with reduction, then administer a strong, great extension: and it is that two assistants should extend their arms. And also let two assistants hold him, so he doesn't move during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is bent back to every part after placing a folded long cloth or wide band over his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches his own joint with his hand, he should apply oil to it: so that this among them helps in lubricating the joint for ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should drive the stitch with a strong impulse until it recedes.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it should be necessary to place on it a plaster where there is coagulation and drying with moisture: and the bandage should be tightened to a suitable tightness.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the invalid: and let it rest for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then loosen (the suspension or bandage).
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the stitch has become firm in its place, then release the bandage from it and let her go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the stitch is not well tight, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and let her rest for several days until it becomes tighter.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release her.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	And if after the reduction of the stitch it happens that she experiences heaviness and is in motion: then apply moistening in a bath, and subtle friction, and compression until it heals. Or place over the stitch a furred thing, that is, a large seahorse.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind her again and let her rest with it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove her, and immerse him in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	And when she sweats, then rub the stitch with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	And afterwards, apply to her once and twice with a furred thing when she enters the bath until it soothes.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if need be, place on her a wet, warmed with butter, tallow, and bind it over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For she does soothe and returns to her own position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of dislocations by Al-Mahassani.
Caput XXIX.	Title XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The shoulder joint is dislocated many times, that is, the connection between the upper arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And reducing this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	In contrast, of the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it must be that the speed is during the reduction of this dislocation when it occurs, before the location settles: or an incident occurs involving a hot pustule.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is, you make Almahassem place his weakened hand on a table and extend the attendant's hand: and the doctor places his palm over the peak of the joint and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it must be considered that if the hand has already retreated to the belly of the hand: then the sick person should place the back of his own hand on the table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should remain internally over the table, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the table so that the doctor's hand falls onto its own peak of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then tighten it with the plaster where the pustule settles: and release it, do not repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate it, you cannot continue with its reduction after passing several days, but the joint remains according to its twist afterwards: and nothing harms the sick person, except that the hand becomes soft, and it cannot be tightened at all: then you will know that the nerves are cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no skill in it except to tighten with a cautery near its condition.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not yield anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	And so, if Almahassem does not return, then place on it a plaster, as we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Next, tie [the wound] and let it rest for five days: afterwards, release it and allow it to heal, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If his movements are restricted and something becomes heavy in there: then warm it with water and apply friction several times until it eases.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	### On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated to any part of the hand, or from the palm's back or belly, then extend the finger and push against the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then hold the head of the finger, and hang it towards the part where it is dislocated, and let it rest for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then hang it and extend the finger until it is straightened out on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	And when it is night, bind it according to that description: and do not cease to release it during the day; and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it if a finger is dislocated towards the belly of the hand: and bind it to that part, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with it when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	### On the treatment of dislocation of the lumbar vertebrae in the back.
Caput XXXI.	Title XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When something befalls someone involving the vertebrae of the back or neck, complete dislocation, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no treatment for it, because death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sickness of the sick person escapes without his will, and he cannot hold it. And many times some parts of his body soften due to it, or both legs of him, or both arms of himself, or one of them: or one vertebra is removed from its place by the others.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Indeed, it often happens like this because the removal occurs in relation to the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed towards the back, is named Humpiness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, the treatment for it is to consider if Humpiness occurs during childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there complete healing from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	As for those that occur due to chance, impact, or similar events, the ancients have already spoken at length about methods of treatment in detail.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which, much does not return with beneficial outcome.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed shortened that which was lengthy due to its proximity and purpose. My exposition of it, and the formation of its tool in a different manner than how they presented it and explained it, and I have presented this as well.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say that regarding the humpiness occurring from the front part, there is no skill nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	Similarly, in that which happens to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And they are not treated by them, except for that which happens properly in the back as I am about to describe. And it is like this: the sick person should extend himself over his own face on an equal platform near a wall, and wetted material should be spread under him so that his chest does not get hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of fixed wood be placed in the trench on the ground, at about the height of its head: and another piece of wood, about the length of its legs, at the other end of the pole: and the attendant holds the wood, and should not firmly set it in the trench.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And let the attendant hold the other one as well.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap it over the patient's head and loosely but firmly tie a ligature under its armpits. Extend the end of the ligature towards the wood that is at its head, and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie another ligature above the hips and over its knees, and at the stones (possibly referring to specific body parts or tools).
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligatures together and tie them to the other piece of wood which is at its feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then have all the attendants stretch the ligatures towards the wood, and do not remove the two pieces of wood from their positions where they are fixed. However, they should not be firmly set as we said before.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor should place his palms on the Spondyle (a term possibly referring to specific body parts or tools) with strength until he leaves it: or place them upon that object.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then attach his feet to the table until he leaves it.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not return through this treatment, then take a table whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And dig in the wall as we said that is near the patient, the place where one can enter the end of the table.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle part of the table on the Spondyle (a term possibly referring to specific body parts or tools).
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the doctor should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten well until it is constricted by the Spondylis, and return it to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you see it, operate with the wheel that is enclosed with your hand: and there is a way, to plant two pieces of wood near the head of the sick at the rear end of each of the legs. And let their length be equal to the span of one arm: and place two pieces of wood near the head of him at the rear end of each leg.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length be what is between each piece of wood, a single palm: and now a hole has been made in every place where the wheel flows: and all pieces of wood are firmly fixed into the ground much, so that they do not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let the round piece of wood be inserted: and there is a wheel where the ligament has rolled in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it there is a hole where the wood is fixed, its length being equivalent to what rolls in addition to itself: and similarly on the other two pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	And then tighten the ligaments that you have tightened in the chest of the sick person with the wheel near its head: and the ligaments that you have tightened on his legs in the wheels near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	And then stand by each wheel with a servant who will turn his hand with the tool that turns the wheel: and the doctor balances the Spondylis, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the wheel which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	And after the Spondylis returns and the location is balanced, then it is necessary to place a dried plaster mixed with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	And then apply the poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place an asterisk above the plaster from the table, whose width should be three fingers or approximately so.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the quantity which occupies the place of curvature, and above the portion of healthy vertebral column.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bound with the ligament that we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the invalid uses fine nourishment until they are healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	And if there remains a certain prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and ease should be administered, with the use of the table we described when we spoke about a long period.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now lead foil is applied to that.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And it sometimes happens that there is prominence at the final vertebral column of the back: and one thinks that through this displacement, and that which already sticks out, becomes this opening.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it is not necessary to assume such a thing about him with this medicine: for perhaps it might cause death.

Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the joint of an ankle and the joint of a shoulder does not occur unless there is simply a dislocation: nor do they have what happens to other joints from removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of an ankle is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	This is because it can be dislocated forwards and backwards.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And mostly it is dislocated towards the inside: and slightly towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment for dislocation towards the inside is: because when you connect the weak thigh of the invalid to his own, it's further away. And his knee sticks out more than a healthy one, and he can't bend his foot at his groin: and there's a spot following on from where the buttocks have been warmed with a hot cloth, for this reason, because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign for him who experiences dislocation is external events, which are opposite occurrences of its kind.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign for him who experiences dislocation in front is that he extends his healthy leg according to completion. However, without any pain existing in his knee, it does not double itself and if he attempts walking, he cannot walk on this side ahead: and he retains urine, and his scrotum swells, and when walking there's a heel strike of his foot upon the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign for him who experiences dislocation at the back is that he does not extend his knee and cannot double itself before it doubles his scrotum. His leg is also shorter on one side. And his groin softens, and there's a thigh bone above the pelvic area.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The correction of this type of dislocation involves considering if the dislocation is old, which has already aged by that time.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer the correction of it and it remains according to its own arrangement: then there is no treatment at all for that.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it does not need to be assumed by him entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In the case of him whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one type among four types of dislocations, then proceed with this method: you need to loosen it, extend it inward and outward, and move it left and right. Perhaps it will return without needing further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if this method does not return the limb in its place, then you need to prepare a strong assistant and have them extend his leg from below. Either manually by using their hands or with a ligament that is tied above the knee on top of his leg, and another assistant should raise his hand upwards so as to insert their hands under his heels.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie with a soft ligament over the root of the thigh bone and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the scapular region, or from the posterior part to the dorsal area.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them serve as one until the sick person is lifted up with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of size is the common type among the four types of size.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If thus the return of the dislocation with what we said is present, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for all types that I say about self-treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Indeed, in the treatment of its own kind when there is a dislocation towards the inside, it must be that the sick person elevates himself over his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then place the ligament over the root of the thigh bone, at the point that is between the head of the thigh bone and beneath the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin area to the higher part of the body, towards the scapular region.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong attendant should take hold of its arms, and reduce the large part of the diseased thigh, extending it forcefully towards the outside.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this is the easier of the other methods of treatment by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If it however escapes you and does not submit to you for entry with this method of treatment entirely, then it must be that the two diseased feet are bound together with a strong ligament at the same time, by a soft one, over both heels, and on both knees: and let each have a length compared to its own quantity of four fingers; and let the weak leg extend beyond another by the measure of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the patient should be suspended over the head of a wooden beam, which is to be in the house: and let its length from the ground be equal to that of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then instruct the strong youth to guard the thigh bone: and have another person suspend the patient with him. And let the other youth push, guarding the thigh bone with strength, for the connection returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the restitution of their own place though, when there's a displacement towards the outside, it must be that the patient lies on a platform, as we narrated in having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the ligament should be tied above his knee, properly for the patient, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then place two pieces of wood; one near his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then place a wooden beam in the middle of the foot, well fixed: under which wet cloths should be wrapped so as not to hurt the patient: and let the wood be between his thighs, so as not to pull towards below during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then, all assistants should extend to their respective parts, and the doctor equalizes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to being returned, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place her/him on the table and press down as we explained with humps, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lie on his/her healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it must be that the patient's leg extends quickly: and this follows in the same description on a platform: and the doctor places his right hand's palm above the groin of the patient.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then with one hand he constrains him and by that constraint extends him down to the lower parts to the knee area.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is towards the backside: then it should not be that the injured person is extended downwards and elevated above the ground. Instead, he should be placed on a hard surface as it would also need to happen when his limb is dislocated externally according to what we said about his lying position on two sides; and he is facing forward, with the ligaments stretched out: just like I explained recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it should be that compression is administered with a table even to the place from which the joint emerges, when completion of the reduction has occurred according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return should not be hidden from you. And this is, to extend both limbs of the sick person: and when you see them equal, and the sick person grips his limb and expands it without any disturbance; then you know that the member has returned already according to what is necessary. Then join the two thighs together, and apply a plaster, and bind with lint, that is, a roll: so as not to move the limb towards any part of the body. And let the sick person rest quietly for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then release the ligament and plaster, and compare the limbs with each other: then if you see them equal in position, you will know that the dislocation has been set firmly. Therefore liberate the sick person for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then return and plaster that area again, binding it according to your first adjustment method, and release the plastering for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then release that (the plaster) and make him prolong walking over a couple of days, until he becomes strong enough.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Title XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It can be dislocated towards the outside, towards the inside, and downwards, that is, towards behind.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not get dislocated towards the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of this dislocation is that when you ask the patient if they feel their leg applying to their thigh, they would not be able to do so.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere with the thigh: then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all manners of this dislocation is to make the patient sit upright so that if they can now extend their leg over it and adhere your back to their face, then place their foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then adhere the knee of its patient with your palms and straighten them between your fingers over the knee of the patient.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm, both sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another assistant should extend the patient's foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of recovery is that the leg should adhere to the thigh gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then bandage him up, and make sure the leg adheres with the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And bind them all together with bandages for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	And then release them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the patient should not use walking for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	And if refusal is given to you for the reduction of his, then administer strong extension with the bands, whose precedes were narrated in the treatment of the ankle, until he returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of dislocation of the calcaneus.
Caput XXXIIII.	Title XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus sometimes is dislocated by a small movement, and sometimes by a full turn.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	The sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, moving towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its return is easy; it consists in extending it gently with the hands and adjusting until it returns to place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of it when it is dislocated by a full turn, you need to make the patient sit straight: and have a strong attendant hold him firmly from behind at the middle part of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then take his foot with your right hand from the upper part of him and in the place of the heel with your left hand from the lower part of his foot.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	And then with your left hand, by two steps.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand, and push the foot's arch towards the shinbone without effort with your right hand.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice as we have instructed.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's arch towards the shinbone in the third turn, and you pull out the heel bone.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns in one or two turns according to this method, and you see the foot aligned, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it: for he himself will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however the reduction of it is prevented by what we have instructed: then make the patient lie down on his back on the ground, and fix a stake firmly into the earth so that it falls between his buttocks: and you have already covered him with a cloth so as not to harm the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant hold the thigh of him: afterwards let the attendant stretch out another foot, or with his hands, or with the band which binds over the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the attendant stretch out against the stretching of his own comparison: and let a pillow stand between the two thighs of the sick person holding him, so that his body does not be drawn towards the lower parts during stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the attendant hold the healthy leg towards the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore, when the dislocation returns and its return to health is declared to you: then apply a plaster and bandage it firmly, and bind it tightly with bands, and connect the foot with the band to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you either fear or consider the nerves that are above the heel bone, so as not to bind the band over them and harm them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then release him for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the band becomes softer, tighten it: then release it on the third or fourth day. And forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	However, if he attempts to walk before that period, there is no security that the dislocation will not loosen upon him, it will be corrupted, and it will not receive treatment after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot boil occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to his sedation the thing that precedes our narrative in another place about treatment and application until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	¶ On Dislocation of the Foot's Fingers, and Care.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated from them by means of extension be corrected with little effort: and indeed this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If the dislocation is in certain nodes of the heel: then it should be that the patient sits with his foot on an equal spot on the ground or on a table: and he stands like one who walks.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand up, and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then strike that with your foot with strength until it returns, and you will realize that it has been corrected, and no longer protrudes in the location.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his heel a table that will hold the entire foot, which should have two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	And then apply it with three days of moderate compression.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then release him, and make him rest from walking for many days until he is tightened and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Section on Types of Dislocations with Wounds or Fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of that sort happens and you attempt its treatment and restoration, it often results in death. Therefore, one should not assume authority over the treatment of such cases without understanding, being compassionate, pious, cautious, not bold nor presumptuous: using only calming medicines at a hot temperature for onset conditions and letting the patient be judged by divine providence for a long duration.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Or do you hope for salvation from destruction with the alleviation of sickness, and there appears something of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt the reduction of its (the patient's) case immediately at the beginning of things, before hot pus occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the member returns, according to what we desire, then administer a regime that stops pus: and take care of the wound with whatever is suitable for it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If there is a dislocation with fracture and happens in the bone of the separated femur, then try their removal, and do what we said about simple illnesses from that which precedes in places like these.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your strength, and protect yourself from entering the way of fear: according to what has preceded my prediction to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more beneficial to your body among them at your time.
