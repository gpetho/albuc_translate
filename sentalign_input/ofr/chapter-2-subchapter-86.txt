of a fistula wherever it may be
Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called a "fistula", and especially when it is deep and produces pus.
And a fistula, in truth, is a false, hard, white knot, where there is no feeling of pain, and is as deep as the feather of a bird;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and other times thick;
sometimes little, and other times a lot;
and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and where there is no flesh, is only due to one of nine causes:
namely, because of lack of blood or bodily strength;
or because of its malignancy;
or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, which prevents new flesh from growing;
or there is too much pus;
or the place is rotten, and the matter is of poor quality;
or the medicine is not good for the treatment;
or because the infection is like a pestilence;
or because of the characteristics of the region, digestion is slow, and healing is slow, and it swells naturally;
or there are veins or bones there:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the medical treatments in the division.
Now I must inform you about the treatment of a fistula that is made by hand. (surgically created)
Know that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body;
for there are fistulas that occur in the large veins, and in the arteries, and in the nerves, or in the peritoneum, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or in the spine of the back, or in any joint of the hands or feet;
and there are some that occur in the principal member itself, and in similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to heal, and there is nothing but work and ignorance (involved in treating them); 
and if there is a fistula that does not reach the place that I have mentioned, and you are confident in the treatment, and you want to examine it, then take a probe of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, and explore it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a thin lead probe, for lead bends easily around the crookedness;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot probe it well, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will run from one opening to another and cleanse it;
then explore it carefully as best you can, so that you know if there is bone or nerve involved, and its depth, and ask the patient carefully about the pain he feels from the pressure of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the location where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove entirely the corrupted matter and flesh that are within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight line, then you must cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in tents soaked in a sharp medicine, and push them right to the end of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then put in ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not hinder you in the principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then scrape it until the corruption is all removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns to pus as before, know that you have not gone deep enough:
so uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, that is good.
If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it;
so there is no other solution than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with forceps, extract it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, do not leave a single one;
and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no error or fear, cut both moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, apply something generating rot to the wound, and leave it until the place is rotted around the bones, and then they will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, like from the leg or thigh, only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone;
it must be scraped and cut all the way to the corruption, and then treated until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that occurred in a man's leg, so that you may take example and assistance in your work.
There was a young man around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that originated within the body, so that the matter went to the leg, and it swelled with a large abscess, and there was no reason to use cautery to open it;
but the physicians, through their foolishness, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed from it, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared there that all released pus and fluid from the body;
and many physicians applied treatment to it for about two years, and none were skilled in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and saw his leg and the medicines with which it was being treated, and what flowed from the holes in large quantity;
and the young man's body became red, and he had a jaundiced complexion.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then probed all the holes, and found that they all connected to each other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption went down to the bone inside;
I scraped away what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption besides what I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with cleansing medicines for a long time, and it would not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing in the bone, and I scraped it, and then removed it, and I tried to heal the place;
but I could not until I cut around a handspan of bone, and pulled it out completely bare, then treated it with medicines;
and it was quickly healed and closed, and there was no need to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure it, and for the fear of death I had for him.
For because of the bloodletting he often sobbed, but he was completely healed, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good quality and he had no harm or discomfort whatsoever, neither in going nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this manner:
Take a linen cloth and tie it to the end of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to pull it upwards;
and put another woolen tie, thicker than the first, and tie it over the flesh that is above the bone, and pull on the end, so that you draw the damaged flesh underneath, and uncover the flesh on the area where you want to treat, so that the silk does not injure the flesh; 
and put a firebrand or a board under the bone so that you can easily cut the damaged flesh;
and it should be treated as long as one can see and feel the infection, and treated again another time.
And if the bone is infected, and it is not visible, and the infection is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a firebrand underneath, and then treat with silk from one side of the infection to the other, and the silk should be a bit longer than the infection, as we have said; 
and if the infection is in the joint, then cut the infected joint, and treat the bone where it connects to the other part; 
and if the infection is in the connection of the two joints, then there is no other solution than to cut;
and if the infection is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, then this is very difficult, but nevertheless you must investigate this corrosion, as it appears to you; 
and clean it in all the ways that you can, but so that the veins or the nerves do not cause you difficulty;
and know that the cutting instruments and the saws for cutting these bones are many, depending on the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size, and their hardness; 
and therefore it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for each type of work;
and know that the work itself will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses;
so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
