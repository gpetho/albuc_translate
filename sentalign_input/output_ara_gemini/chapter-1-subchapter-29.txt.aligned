Chapter twenty-nine on cauterizing hemorrhoids.	CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE. On cauterization for pleurisy.	0.7523667
The ancients mentioned cauterization with birthwort roots for cold quinsy in this manner. It is that you take from the long dry roots of birthwort a single root, the longest you can find, and it should be as thick as a finger, then dip it in oil and burn it in fire, then cauterize with it once between the junction of the clavicle and the neck. And two small cauterizations a little below the jugular veins, inclined towards the area under the chin.	The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.	0.9009654
And two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs. And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclined slightly towards the back. And another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach. And three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the back, lower than the cauterization that is between the two hands.	And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.	0.96327543
And it is not appropriate to deepen your hand with the cautery, rather it should be on the surface of the skin, a superficial burning.	It is not necessary to cauterize deeply, but let it be a mere hint, in the outer skin.	0.59166086
And some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, like a probe, and heat it up, and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself, and extract the pus as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors.	Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver.	0.8532826
And in this recklessness with cautery is a great risk: either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area that has no cure.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.7669723
