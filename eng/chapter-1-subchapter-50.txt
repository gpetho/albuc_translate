 CHAPTER FIFTY.
On cauterization for cancer.
When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.
Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle.
This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.
So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.
