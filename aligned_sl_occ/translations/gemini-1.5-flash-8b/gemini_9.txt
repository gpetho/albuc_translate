O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, by its completion, its conclusion, and its explanations, it seems to me that I have fulfilled it for you with this treatise, which is a section of the manual operation, that is, surgery.
Because manual operation is largely lost in our region and time, almost all knowledge of it is lost; only a few small descriptions in the books of the ancients remain, which have led to errors and hesitation, so that the understanding of it, and the skill and art, have been lost.
And it seems to me that I will revive that [manual operation] through the organization of this treatise, in the way of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and so that it will come with the forms of cautery instruments and other tools of the craft, it is necessary to add a description and preparation of these.
But the reason why a skillful artisan with their hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and that its practitioners must beforehand be practiced in the science of anatomy, which explains the structure of the limbs, and the forms of those, their connection and separation; and must have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number and arrangement; and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their emergence.
And for that reason, Hippocrates said that with one name [i.e., a general concept] it's a great deal, but in the practice [i.e., in the hands-on work] it's small, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said this in the introduction to this book; because whoever is not familiar with what we have said about anatomy will certainly fall into an error by which men will die, as I have seen many of them; for some are trained in this science and abandon it without knowledge or experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician attempt to lance a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and opened some arteries in the neck so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician attempt to remove a stone from a man who had suffered from it for a long time.  The stone was large, and he proceeded to remove it with a piece of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And I, having already called myself to account, saw that because of the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I knew he would die.
And I saw another physician, who received payment from a duke in our land for surgery, and he was treating a black man who had a fractured thigh.  Through the physician's ignorance, he treated the fracture, applying bandages and splints with excessive pressure, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he followed his desires, and then he bound it, and then he left it for a few days and commanded that we untie the ligament. And it remained like this until the thigh and the foot became abscessed, and led to destruction.
And I was called to him, and I proceeded to untie the ligament, and consequently, there was tranquility and a lessening of his pains.
However, since corruption was already established in the limb, I could not stop it, and the corruption continued in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after a few days, until the evil of it was magnified by the patient's condition.
Since this condition is caused by black bile, it is not necessary to destroy it completely by any iron, but rather that the limb that suffers from its complete removal should be carefully considered.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the operation be divided into two parts: one where the operation is associated with health, and the other where the operation holds danger in its most severe forms.
And I have already avoided this throughout this book in which the operation contains error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against it and leave it aside, so that the pages do not find a way to speak and disgrace you.
Therefore, take your weapons with diligence and with God's protection, and your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best path, by God's grace, aiming for health and praiseworthy success, and abandon those terrible illnesses with difficult cures, and remove from your armour anything that makes you afraid, so that your faith and your name might not fail you: for greater glory remains for you, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Already has Gualia said in some of her teachings: Do not treat a bad illness, so that you are not called bad doctors.
And I have now divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter, ordered from head to foot, describes the forms of instruments and the tools for cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting, piercing, cupping, poultices, the extraction of arrows and similar things, is a complete and ordered chapter concerning the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments.
It is necessary for me to explain the benefits and harms of this cautery, and in what constitution it is forbidden.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the benefits and harms of cautery is long and verbose, subtle in its science, and a hidden secret; and many learned people have already spoken of it, and disagreed about it, but a little of their discourse will suffice me, fearing to prolong it.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all constitutions universally, whether with matter or without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.
In the hot and dry constitution with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial for that, and others say the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for an illness that is characterized by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is not appropriate for a hot and dry illness to be cured with something that is also hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite argue that cautery is beneficial in every hot and dry illness affecting the body, because when you compare the body and its humours to the constitution of fire, you find the body to be cold.
And I say, concerning this matter, that experience has revealed this to me on several occasions.
However, it is not appropriate for someone to comment on this who has not already been practiced and skilled in the chapter on cautery through prior exercise, and who has not understood the diversity of human constitutions, the nature of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the appropriate timeframe for treating them.
But in other constitutions, there is no need for concern, and especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all physicians have agreed on these, and there is no disagreement on the benefit of cautery in such cases.
And know, children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its efficacy, differs from cautery with medicinal burning agents, because fire is simple, its action only affects the part cauterized, and does not harm other parts connected to it, except with minor harm.
But the action of medicinal burning agents reaches those parts of the body that are distant from the application, and easily causes difficult-to-heal illnesses and severe harm in the affected part.
However, fire, due to its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, but rather it's superfluous.  And this is already known to us through experimentation and long study of the art of understanding the truth of causes; and because of this, I am excused from a long discourse.  If it were not that it is not written in my book on this subject, and that the secrets related to fire, its effect on the body, and the expulsion of ailments by means of fire, are hidden from you, a philosophical demonstration would be appropriate for your understanding.
And know, children, that they disagree about the time when cautery is most appropriate, and they suggest the best time is spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at any time, because the harm caused by an inappropriate time is outweighed by the benefit of what is removed with cautery, especially if the cautery is performed for severe and urgent pains or ailments that cannot tolerate delay because the feared harm (the disease) is greater than the minor damage that time might cause.
And this is not in your understanding, or children, this is only believed by the ignorant populace and foolish physicians, that is to say, that the disease cured by cautery is not always beneficial, and they ignore the consequences.
And the reason is not at all as they suppose, for cautery is not just any medicine that alters the constitution and dries out the humors that are the cause of the pain.
But nevertheless, cautery is superior to other medicine because of its power and efficacy, and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient's constitution, the location of the illness, the patient's strength, and the accumulation of superfluous humors in the body, as well as what has been acquired through their diet and similar causes.  However, if the illness for which cautery is administered is a localized ailment with only a small amount of superfluous humors and moisture, such as toothache and similar conditions, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this is in small cases.
And it is a common saying that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and this is a true statement, not in the way they understand it, for they believe there is no cure that benefits more than cautery.
And the reason is the opposite of that; the idea that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only true when, in some illnesses, we have exhausted other methods of treatment and those remedies have not helped, and then at the end of the process, cautery is applied and proves useful. And therefore, the statement that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not true according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they said this only because of the nobility and superior nature of gold's substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not do harm, though this is not entirely true, for I have tested this and found that it only does so in certain bodies and not others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you perform cautery with gold, it is not immediately evident, because it is heated according to the amount you desire by the density of the gold, and because it is prepared to receive cold; and if you apply heat, the gold melts in the fire, and in the fire certain flakes fall, so that the craftsman is harmed by the work.
Therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately for the correctness of the operation.
And I have organized this chapter on cautery according to topics, and I have arranged them from head to feet, so that the seeker can find what they need.
The first chapter.
This cauterization addresses the dampness and cold affecting the brain, which has two main causes:  an excess of rheumatic fluid (called catarrh), flowing from the head to the eye and ear areas;  excessive sleep; toothache; and pain in the throat.  More generally, it treats all illnesses stemming from cold, including paralysis, stroke, and similar conditions.
The method for this cauterization is as follows: first, instruct the patient to take laxative medicine to clear the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and usual response.
Then, tell him to shave his head, and afterwards, place him on a smooth bench with your hands supporting his feet.
And then place the blade of your palm (or the blade of the instrument) near the bridge of his nose, between his eyes. However, once your middle finger has reached the place, mark that spot with a probe, and then apply the olive-oil cautery, the process for which is as follows:
Then place it (the cautery) on the spot marked by the probe,  so that it descends, gradually pressing your hand down, and you rotate it.
Then gently lift your hand and observe the area. If you see a noticeable amount of bone exposed, about the size of a grain of millet, then elevate your hand, and if not, return your hand with the iron, another one from the set, if it's cooled down, until the bone is visible as I told you.
Then take a small amount of salt and dissolve it over the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cloth soaked in broth and leave it on until the scab from the burn is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And if the wound remains open, the better you move the arm, because it is better and more helpful.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's marrow is burned.
And then whatever is burned off the bone should be scraped off, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery they should proceed to the back, until it firmly presses on the bone, so that the bone gives way.  This is the method of a small cauterization. And they believe that vapors from the head escape from that area.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
However, I have not seen these two types of cauterization in all cases, but in some people according to a fearful approach; and in my opinion, it is better, when possible, with healing, for the head is weakened by the disruption of its continuity, just as we have seen in other limbs, and especially when the patient's head is of a weak constitution.
And the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion; and by using it and with that procedure, healing occurs.
Second Chapter.
Of the cauterization of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain affects the entire head in a prolonged illness, and treatments like leeches, cups, head purges, plasters, poultices, baths, lotions, and similar remedies have been used, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cauterization method that we have described and no benefit comes from those things, then consider that if the patient's head has a strong constitution, and it is not frail and is subjected to considerable cold, then cauterize with another cauterization technique beneath the first one a little bit. And then cauterize that area over the patient's forehead with a cauterizing instrument until the pain is relieved. Cut open the pain and expose the bone to the extent we described, and cauterize that area with a cautery on the back of the head, in the location called the *vas* (vein) – which is the area where a cupping vessel is placed. And ease your hand in doing this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience very severe pain, different from the pain caused by other cauteries of the head.
And I would advise this cautery in this place, because the cautery used for cauterizing the temples and occiput should be a more delicate cautery than that used to cauterize the middle of the head; and this is the method for it.
Third Chapter.
Of the cauterization of non-chronic migraines.
When a constant or spreading pain occurs in the head, or extends to the eye, the head should be cleared with medicaments, and the other treatment, which I have described in the discussions of illnesses, should be administered; and if all of this is ineffective, then cauterization in that area is done in two ways: either with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and squeeze it and incise the extremities of it at both ends. And then you cut the area of pain in the temple with a sharp lancet until a space is made beneath the skin, until it is hidden.
Then press on it with a bandage to constrict it, and leave it for three hours; and then remove it and take away the garlic, and let the wound be for two or three days, and then apply cotton soaked in butter until the area heals.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron, according to this method:  heat the cautery iron, of which this is the form:
and it is called a "claus clavilhs," for its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
Then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand — so the underlying skin isn't burned — and rotate the iron slowly with speed.
And if the amount burned by the sharpness of the cautery is about half, then lift your hand so the underlying artery isn't burned, to prevent blood flow.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place cotton soaked in butter, and then treat with ointment until healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the sharp edge of a knife as a cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular, somewhat unusual, procedure.
Fourth Chapter.
On the cauterization of an old migraine.
When you treat a migraine using what we have described in the previous treatment and what we have discussed in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment proves ineffective, and sometimes the ailment resists what we have described regarding the initial cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then you must heat the knife cautery until it is white-hot, then draw a line on the area of pain, a length equal to half a finger or thereabouts; press your hand down once, and press firmly until you cut into the artery and penetrate down to the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jawbone, which is strained by chewing, and that the ligaments and nerves that control it are not overly tense and that a spasm does not result.
And if it is about the care and caution of the blood flow from the cut artery, for fear exists in its cutting, and even more so for him who does not understand what he does and is not studious and skilled; and he abandons the operation at the beginning.
And I will bring a reminder of the treatment for accidental blood flow from an artery according to its method, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this ailment is not relieved by this cautery and you see the patient's condition as tolerable, cauterize the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have described in the chapter on the constriction of arteries with a cautery having two blades; this is a better and more beneficial cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear is caused by cold and is treated with laxative remedies and the other treatments mentioned in the previous section, and the pain persists, then apply the cautery, specifically the one called the *puncta* (pointed cautery).  Its form is this:
And then, apply the heated point [of the cautery] around the ear, moving it in a circular motion, or in a circuit around affected areas if the pain is localized. Move the cautery from the base of the ear slowly, after marking the area with a probe.
And if the cautery is used with ten points throughout the ear, then treat the affected areas until they heal.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of the tumour.
A tumour that is cured with cauterization is only of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type that comes from drying or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of tumor with herbs, purging, and other remedies, and your treatment does not work, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the diseased area, for softening only comes to the side that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize the area directly at the end of the ear, slightly above the corner of the head, and another one on the temple, the length of which should be equal to the length of the index finger, and hold the cautery there until the quantity of the inflamed portion of the condition has been burned away by half.
And this is the form of the cauterization, and it is a type of surgical procedure, the form of which is set forth below. However, it is more subtle than that described; and it is necessary to cut away a little of the superfluous thickness there.
And then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Of cauterization for old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on all the temples of their head; and with a cautery on the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done according to what has been previously stated.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and further back; and then it should be treated with the following procedures.
Chapter 8.
Of cauterization of oblivion caused by flame.
There should be given to the sick person at the beginning large jars and pills that purify the brain.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and apply a plaster of centaury, as described in the treatise on plasters, to the patient's temples.
And apply that several times, for that is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order which I have already mentioned.
And so if by that treatment he is cured, well and good; but if not, then apply three cauteries to the back part of his head, which descend from the most superior part of the head down to the part of the neck below. And place the thickness of the finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with what has been previously described.
But if you wish to increase the application, and the patient can tolerate it, then apply a cautery in the middle location; and if you wish a greater application, then cauterize it over the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cautery be oily according to the previously given method.
Chapter 9.
Of the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
You should proceed with cleaning the head with herbs and as we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on all the horns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if in the illness of softening of the body, the patient and the illness are severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and subsequently with a cautery until it is softened from the spinal cord, and remove your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive cautery.
Chapter 10.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the brain from the beginning with herbs and other treatments that we have discussed in the section when the patient is severe and able to tolerate the impact of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate the medicines, then administer remedies and chewing agents that treat the brain, previously for many days, with a beneficial diet.
Then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, following the previous method, and with another cautery on the back of their head, and cauterize on each temple of their head. And if the illness is severe and able to tolerate it, then cauterize it with the cauteries I have mentioned, having simultaneously paralysis and softening of the body, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-oil-based, as was previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then place a delicate cautery, according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries that we have described in the section on paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity inclining towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him to drink that which purifies his brain, according to what has been previously stated in the division.
And then shave the patient's head, and then apply a properly made plaster to it around the circumference, and then place that in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and supported on all sides.
And then apply liniment; and a boiled sheep's wool is even more worthy. And heat that over the fire with a moderate heating, which the said patient can tolerate when it is applied to him. And then apply that to the middle of his head in a circular motion, and leave it until it has cooled.
And do this with the patient once a week, with the other remedies for him until he is healed; or, if you wish, cauterize the area making small punctures according to his tolerance, but keep your hand with a properly arranged cautery. This is a type of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
And then apply this cloth soaked in boiled or warmed wine.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of descending water in the eye.
When you have observed the beginning of water in the eye according to the signs described in the previous section, then begin giving the patient a drink that will modify the condition of his head and protect him from all moisture.
And have him sweat in a bath for several days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of his head; and then cauterize with two cauteries on both temples if the water affliction is in both eyes, or on one temple if the affliction is in one eye.
Cauterize all the veins and arteries under the temple; and let the cauteries be of that length in the breadth of the temples.
And be careful of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flowing from him, stop it with any medicine possible to you.
And I will come with skill in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and precaution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck between the two bones with two cauteries directly applied.
Chapter 13.
Of the cauterization of old sores.
When sores on the face are old, persistent, and through the veins and arteries visible on the surface of the head, and it is clear that this is due to cold phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize this with the cautery we described in the chapter beginning with hot water on the sores, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries on the neck below the temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if further treatment is needed, then cauterize that along the entire edge of the sore on the eyebrow's extremity with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Of cauterization of a foul odor from the nose.
When you treat it with what we've discussed in the division and your treatment is ineffective, then you prepare and give the patient poppy seeds to drink for three nights; and then wash his/her head, and cauterize it with a milder cautery and an olive cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove cautery, using two cauteries on the two eyebrows below the hair, a small one.
And be careful of the spark so you don't set it on fire.
And this is the form of the clove cautery.
Chapter 15.
Of cautery for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery using this lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you [do so], cauterize the area above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries, in all directions, and they should be elongated from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the amount of eyebrow.
And do not press your hand with the cautery too hard, but according to the amount needed to adhere the third part of the eyelid.
Chapter 16.
Concerning cauterization of the eyelid when the lashes have grown inward and are irritating the eye.
When the eyelashes of the eye have turned inward, irritating the eye, cauterization in such cases is done in two ways: either with a burning iron or with a burning medicine.
If with a cautery using fire, first instruct the patient to remove their eyelashes, as if one would pluck them, until they are elongated and plucked out; and if you cauterize just beneath their roots, then bind their eyes with a bandage so that they are not irritated until the eyelashes have grown back.
Then, when they have grown back and been plucked out, place the patient's head on your lap, and carefully apply a cautery to the eyelid(s) using a cautery tool shaped like a myrtle leaf, starting the mark near the lashes.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or a pilli mixture over the eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this shape.
And then cauterize the marked area, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely charred.
A sign of successful treatment is that you see the eyelid drawn in and the eyelashes raised towards the puncture in the eye.
And then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with lint over it until the scab is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if any cause returns to the roots of the hair, and the eyelid is softened, then do the cauterization again, just as you did at first.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize them until they are raised to their natural place and are embedded, and the hairs no longer prick the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine is that you command the patient to leave the hairs until they are elongated and embedded, and then a leaf-shaped piece of cloth should be made, in the form of a myrtle leaf.
And then take known herbs and living ash, or similar things, and thoroughly mix those substances quickly, so that it does not become cold; and then spread this mixture onto the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place that over the one or both eyes; and place a cloth soaked in egg white underneath the eye, and the patient's head should be in your care.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it slightly, but don't remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, because the burning is like a fire.
And therefore, when the patient feels the burning sensation, remove the medicine and wash it away with your finger; then, when the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then observe whether the eyelid has already risen, as if cleansed of the constriction by fire or incision, for then it is good; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the area where the medicine wasn't applied, and do not give up until your treatment is embedded and the eye is healed.
And then place a cloth over it until the burn is healed, and then treat it with a definitive ointment or another remedy until it is cured.
It is necessary for you, during your treatment, to carefully guard against anything from the medicine falling into the eye, and if the eyelid softens after a few days and some substance from the eyelashes gets into the eye, then repeat your application of medicine to the softened area of the eyelid, just as you did at the beginning, and continue this until it is healed.
And this is the method of treating a wound with myrrh.
And know that human wounds vary in size and severity, and therefore your treatment is performed accordingly.
And the path to recovery will not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of fistulas in the tear duct of a wound.
When you treat a fistula as described in the classifications of diseases, and your treatment does not improve, you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have an assistant hold the patient's head between your hands in such a way that it is neither moved nor shaken by their head.
And then apply a piece of cotton dipped in egg white or marshmallow pulp over the wound.
And then apply the cautery, which has this shape:
which is concave, like the shape of a reed or a hawk's wing, on one end where the cautery is made.
And if desired, it should be penetrating to the other end. And if you want, it should be shaped like a probe.
But nevertheless, the concave one is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and through it drain and dry that [infected area]. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which is well ignited, on it, and hold it with your hand a little away from the cautery's point, towards the nose area, so that your hand does not stray or the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the inflamed area and cauterize it.
And therefore, if at the beginning of your cauterization you penetrate to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then apply cotton with oil and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is clean as is appropriate in your chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier practitioners used:  Apply a cautery to the fistula and cauterize it, then place a thin, shaped piece of melted lead into the fissure.  Hold it in place with your hand, securely, to avoid moving the patient, so the melted lead does not reach the sore.  Cover the patient's skin over the fistula with a bandage dipped in egg white or water, because melted lead adheres to the fistula area and heals it with marvelous recovery.
And if the fistula is healed with the cauterization and treatment we have described, that is good; but if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal passage and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose, returning it to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the cauterization of a fissure in the pot (or perhaps, a fissure in the body).
Often, fissures occur in the lips, and more so in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures using the methods we have described in the divisions and your treatment is not successful, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form shown below:
And let its curvature be according to the thinness of the blade (or knife).
Then carefully place that heated cautery on those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or the palate or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess forms, then it breaks, and then it is old, and pus runs and a fistula is formed, and you treat it and it doesn't help with healing, then you must cauterize it according to the amount that is found inside the fistula.  Place that cautery in the hole of the fistula and keep your hand there until the heated iron reaches the bottom, and do this once or twice behind it. Then treat it with what we have said about healing until it is healed.
And therefore, if the suppuration is separated and healed, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be explained in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with medicines and it doesn't help, then place the patient's head in your lap and then heat the cautery—the shape of which will be given—so you place the cannula on the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it. Keep your hand there for a short time so the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as desired.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, for the decayed tooth is sealed, the softened gums are strengthened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is caused by cold, or there is cold or a worm in the area, and you do not consider medicine suitable for treatment, then cauterization there is in two ways: either with a cow's bladder, or with fire.
Cauterization with a bladder is done by taking a cow's bladder, boiling it in an iron container, then taking a piece of cloth and wrapping it around the tip of the probe, dipping that wrapped cloth into the boiled bladder, and quickly placing it on the aching tooth until it cools down.
And then repeat this several times until the effect of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cloth in the aforementioned bladder, place that on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by holding a needle or iron, ensuring its thickness is appropriate so that the heat does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, whatever shape it may be, and place it on the tooth, holding it until the cautery cools; repeat this several times until the pain subsides, either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, during the application of the cautery, the patient fill his/her mouth with a good potion and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize with whatever extremity you can.
And this is the method of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Of cauterization of extrophy.
When extrophy is caused by phlegm and cold humors, and it is not amenable to digestion through medicine, and you desire a quick digestion of them, then you heat the cautery in the manner described below; having two open ends so that the smoke escapes from the cautery through one end, and place that heated object on the abscess once, and again if needed, until you reach the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and place a piece of cloth soaked in a solution on top until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointments, dressings, and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Of cauterization of throat obstructions and constriction of the windpipe.
When moisture collects in the bronchial tubes, and especially when this is due to a cold disposition, then the patient should initially be treated with laxative medicines, and then the affected area should be cauterized near the root of the throat in the depressed region.
And be careful not to extend the cautery to the throat or burn the skin too deeply, but only slightly.
And cauterize the area with another cautery near the junction of the neck, at the back of the patient's vertebra. And the cautery should be a sharp, pointed instrument, in the manner previously described.
And then treat it with what was previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning cauterization for lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the ailment is old, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the furcula, in the depressed, distant and hollow places; and with another cautery in the middle area of the foot between two nipples; and let the cautery be sharp, according to the previous form.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be done by puncturing with the cautery called "puncta", the form of which you have previously described in the section on ear pain.
And make punctures around those areas; and then treat it with the same methods that have been described previously until it is healed.
And the cautery should have three prongs, for cauterization is done with it: with one application, you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the tic douloureux, which is the head of the ailment.
When the head of the ailment (tic douloureux) is dislocated due to slippery humidity and is not held in place during its return from the dislocation until it is in place, and then by a slight movement it is displaced as it should, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned on their back or on their side; then raise the bone that is in the inner part of the tic douloureux to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated in the inner parts.
And then apply the cautery with two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the bone until it penetrates to the other side; and the figure of cauterization will then be of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and for that reason the cauteries are eight.
And then place a poultice of cooked salt on the cautery, and then make the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done, then cauterize the muscle with a wedge-shaped cautery or with several pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive humidity enter the stomach, causing a disturbance to its proper composition and multiplying the ailment within, and if you continue the treatment methods and do not succeed, then the patient should lie on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize it with three cauteries: one under the foot, approximately the width of a finger, with a wedge-shaped cautery, and two cauteries beneath the two sides of the first, until a triangular cautery shape is formed; and separate those that are not properly joined, which will then provide a stronger effect.
And if the depth of the cautery is about two-thirds the thickness of the cord.
And the shape of the cautery should be in this fashion, without additions. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this way; and this should be a cautery in the shape of a circle in this fashion:
And the stomach should be cauterized by puncturing it, as is appropriate for this cautery.  And you should make a mark on the stomach according to the desired amount with a probe, and then cauterize the marked areas with a cautery; and then treat it with the preceding treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain in the liver is caused by coldness, or moisture, or a large amount of wind, until its normal condition is expelled through an excess discharge, and the illness is treated as previously discussed but not cured, then it is necessary that the patient be lying on their back, and you should mark three cauteries in this manner and this same size on the liver under the ribs, where a person’s back rests.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be aligned with the length of the body's right side.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the amount of cauterized area is half the width of the back of a fingernail, and no more should be applied;  and if the patient is standing on their feet, and if they are not standing, then they should be lying down, with their legs outstretched, and their arms raised.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed too much with the cauterization, and do not cauterize the width of an entire fingernail, lest it burn the entire body and reach the intestines, for the skin here is delicate; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of a liver abscess with cautery.
When there is inflammation or an abscess in the liver, and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or its covering, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient will experience intense pain and weight.
And if it is in the liver's covering, the pain is sharp and often leaves doctors struggling to treat it.
Therefore, the patient should be placed on their side; then locate the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which is shaped like a rag, the shape of which is shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the core, until it bleeds clean.
And then treat it, along with the other abscesses, until it is healed.
And only use this type of cautery if the study of it in the art of medicine is extensive, and many illnesses have known it; however, sometimes someone with less experience might be rash in this operation, but rather let that alone, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
Of the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cauterization of the roots of aristolochia, for pleurisy, cold, should be done this way: take a long, dry root of aristolochia, one that's found to be long and pointed, and as thick as your finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck with a cautery.  Use two smaller cauteries slightly angled downward toward the area below the beard, and two more cauteries angled slightly downward between the fifth and sixth ribs, behind the area.  Apply another cautery to the middle of the back; another to the stomach; and three cauteries on the posterior area.  Use a cautery on the area between the shoulder blades, and two more cauteries on the sides of the back, below the cautery between the shoulder blades.
And do not place your hand on the cautery; rather, it should be in the open, displayed in a visible manner.
And some ancient physicians said that some people use a cautery shaped like a ray, heating it and applying it to the area between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and the pus is discharged, as we have described for abscesses of the liver.
But this cauterization is not without risk, for if you happen to cause an accidental fistula in the area, there is no cure.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease with the methods we've described in the division, and your treatment doesn't work, then cauterization in that area can be done in three ways, all of which are effective. One way is to make three or four linear cauteries along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the cauteries for the liver, the method for which has been described previously.
And the distance between each cautery should be the width of a finger, or a little more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as that described for cauterizing the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be lying on their back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to ignite the cautery using two incisions, as described in the chapter on muscle dislocations, and lift the ribcage on the side of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And your lifting should be done along the length of the body, so that cauteries are made along the width of the body.
Then, insert the two incisions, lit strongly, into the space where they will penetrate the ribcage on the other side.
Then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three incisions.
And now you treat the cautery, since it has stopped emitting pus after several days, for this is more important than the other preceding actions in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of dropsy.
Cautery is not applied to dropsy but to elephantiasis properly.
When you treat dropsy using the methods of treatment we have described in the division and your treatment does not work, then you must cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one cautery on the right foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportional to the severity of the condition.
And leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient's condition near the cautery with what is necessary, so that two intentions are added to it, and thus it will be hastened in its healing.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the belly should be wedge-shaped, following the shape of the previous one; and the shape of the cautery used to cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, following the previous one's shape.
Chapter 32.
Of cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot in the area between the auricular and anular (tendons/ligaments), raising the cautery with your hand and not twisting it;  then lift your hand, and do not completely withdraw it, for the yellow water will rush out.
The cautery should be of this shape:  Then, place two cauteries on the two thighs, and on each thigh use the knife-like tip of the cautery. And let the cautery be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee, and another below the middle of the thigh; and place two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with the things we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the abdominal region.
When the abdominal region is afflicted by cold and moisture, to the point that it weakens the virtues – namely, the digestive and retentive virtues located in the stomach and intestines – it is treated using the methods of treatment and not by relying on remedies.  And sometimes, when the patient tolerates cauterization, exhibiting strength, then cauterize the area with a large cautery over their stomach, following the procedure previously described for cauterizing the stomach, using a circular cautery and four small, subtle cauteries around the navel, and a small, keyhole-shaped cautery.  And use a large cautery on the abdomen, or two cauteries.
And if sometimes the excess moisture is prominent, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the area above the groin and over the intestines, and firmly placing two cauteries on the stomach and close to the groin, for it is a perfect cure, a beneficial remedy, from which there is no mistake.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids are due to a thick, cold humor or corrupt moisture, and they have not been cured by the methods mentioned in the division and you are not confident about the treatment's success, then cauterize with three cauteries upon the swollen area below the small spine and a small, triangular one, and with a cautery above the navel the size of two fingers.
And if you fear that the patient's stomach is inflamed, and their food is not being digested, and their face is often inflamed, then cauterize above the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and another cautery on the spleen, using a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for a period of time, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of abscesses near the removal of them.
When you remove an abscess, then you ignite the cautery that resembles a ray. Then place that ignited cautery within the removed abscess, and finally guide your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if there are many abscesses, then cauterize each one according to what we have described, and then treat them with the ointments you apply until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on a large area, it is more harmful than helpful.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that have formed naturally in various parts of the body.
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, it should be treated with cauterization.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula that has formed naturally, is old, and has corrupted pus and moisture, then the most appropriate course of action is to probe it with a delicate probe, and then determine the depth of the fistula using the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery, which should be shaped like a ray. Then place this heated cautery into the fistula, to the depth to which the probe went.
And repeat the cauterization over that spot until those corrupted tissues are burned away, once, or twice, or three times, depending on your needs.
And be careful not to burn any nerves or veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or towards the intestines, then be careful about those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not penetrating.
Then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or in the proximity of a diseased part, or that it comes from those causes which will return to the area.
Chapter 37.
Concerning cauterization of the kidneys.
When the kidneys are painful due to cold or excessive wind, and because of this the patient's body is inflamed, then it is necessary to cauterize the area above the kidneys, using a pointed cautery on each kidney.  The cauterization should bring about a resolution of the problem.
And cauterize lightly with the second a little lower, so that there will be three aligned cauterizations, and thus they will be more effective in the cure.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize the area just below the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin.  Cauterize with one cautery on the right side and another on the left side of the patient.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the amount of the wound's pain; and cauterize there with a cautery on the lowest part of the wound, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a wedge-shaped one, according to the procedure.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the womb.
When cold and moisture are present in the womb, and for this reason conception is forbidden, and her menstrual periods are corrupted, and their occurrence is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we have said in the case of cauterizing the bladder; and with a cautery on the lowest part of the wound, or with two cauteries, and the cautery should be wedge-shaped.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of a dislocated ankle.
When mucous moisture is accumulated in the ankle area, and causes it to be displaced from its proper location, and a sign of this is that the joint is elongated relative to the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it is swollen.
Then you should cauterize the patient's ankle area with a circular cautery, after you have marked the area's outline with a probe, so that the affected area falls into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form used in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And perform the cauterization according to the extent of the inflammation throughout the area; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the area of the groin, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is cured by what we have already said and do not repeat, which is outdated.  Then you should rid the patient of gross humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize the area.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods.  One is to cauterize the area near the patient's groin with three triangular cauteries, shaped in this way; and make a good depth with them. And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, whether the cauteries are small or large.
However, sometimes the cautery is placed over the middle area over the groin, which means there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, whose form is previously used in cauterization of groin dislocations,  [using] a continuous circle and burning the inflammation throughout the area.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized to the groin and has not spread to the thigh.
However, if the pain has spread to the thigh, then cauterize that area with two cauteries on the thigh, over the spot where the patient's pain is located; and use one cautery on the shin, about four fingers' width towards the outside.
And if the cautery is knife-like, then the depth of the cautery should be according to the amount of inflammation in the area.
And if the patient indicates that the pain has spread to the area near the toes, then cauterize that area with a cautery at three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates pain below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize that area with a knife-like cautery.
And be careful in every cauterization that you do not burn nerves or major arteries, lest you cause further harm or contraction to the patient.
And I have already seen others who cauterized near the ankle and, in the cauterization, caused the leg to swell up until the swelling reached the foot, and the foot became perforated and corrupted. And this often leads to severe abdominal problems, and subsequently death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
And some learned men in the practice of cauterization suggest a cautery of this type: make it in the shape of an iron ring, whose circumference is half a palm; and let its opening be according to the thickness of a date seed or a little less.
And within that ring, place another one; and let the space between them be the size of a hazelnut; and let those rings be open in two parts; and let the length of those wedges be one or two hazelnuts, and make those iron wedges appropriately fitted into the rings; and this is its shape:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the body, the patient lying on their side. And therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at one time.
And then leave it for three days; then apply a plaster with butter and leave the wound open for many days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says:  O, children, we have used little of this type of cautery because of the fear of its appearance, and because few have been found who look upon it with approval.
But of the good cauteries, to those who endure them, and find with it the place of their affliction.
But cautery with adhering medicines is what you should do:  make two circles using an awl-pierced instrument, from which the iron bar of the gate hangs; let the length of the wall be in proportion to their size, they should be two nuts or wedges.
And if the spaces between each are the size of a finger's width; and let them be open below and above, and let them contain each other in this manner:
And then place the patient lying on their side upon the affected area, and place your hand over the affected area.  Then take hot water and pour it between the two circles, and let the heat gradually increase with gentle fire, and hold it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and scorching - for that produces a burning sensation like that of fire - until the burning stops.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the entire affected area with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and apply a bandage until the blackness of the burn remains, and leave it for several days, and the area will heal; this is the final treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a poultice for the affected area that contains water, as was done for the affected area of the foot.
And this is the method of applying hot water, and I have already written about it in my treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take a portion of potash and quicklime, each one part, and crush them. Place them in a new pot, the bottom of which has a small hole,  corresponding to the size of the wound.
And place another, lined pot beneath the bottom of the first pot.  Pour fresh, sweet water over the potash and quicklime in the top pot, gradually, a little at a time.  Then, after you have thoroughly mixed them by hand, let the excess, now caustic, water drain down into the lower lined pot.
Then collect all that water and pour it over fresh quicklime and potash, for it will now be highly caustic.  This is used in many medical procedures and for cauterizing other parts of the body, as it acts as a form of fire.
And some of the medicines used for cauterization include:  teazizic, honey, and quicklime with some kind of spice, mixed together in this way.
And Galen, recounting the procedure and cure of an ancient physician, speaks highly of this method for treating pain in the groin and sciatic nerve, stating that it required no further treatment and that once the patient is treated in this way, they are fully cured.  He says that a simple bath and this treatment is enough.
And it is to be taken, if possible, fresh green ceratargi, or if not found green, fresh fig; and it should be finely crushed with a little cumin and placed on the affected area in the groin, thigh, or leg, and bound up.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient experiences a lessening of the burning sensation.
And then place him in a bath, and when his body is thoroughly warmed, lay him on the ground, for the pain will cease and he will be cured.
And know that no one should use cautery with these remedies except after the body's evacuation.
But already Eschirides said that when, with a goat's horn, a constricted vein is cauterized, it benefits him greatly; and the cautery should be done this way:  wool should be soaked in old oil, and placed between the heel and the ankle.
Then take a dry goat's horn, and heat it over fire until it is charred; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it has spread out. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the sensation of the biting [pain] reaches the chest and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the cautery of goats (or "goat's horn cautery").
Chapter 42.
Of the cauterization of pain in the two [parts, or areas].
Sometimes pain in the back arises from various causes, such as injury, blows, or excessive discharge, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold and moist material.
And cautery is only effective in this specific type of pain, which is caused by the outflow of cold material.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with pills and similar remedies, applying them to the back where the pain is, making three lines along the width of it, placing five cauteries or more in each line, according to the patient's tolerance and the cauteries' strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medial, wedge-shaped cautery, according to this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a swelling.
This ailment often affects young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that they stumble or fall, and show difficulty in raising and moving their limbs.
And you find at the rear of the spinal column, and in the vertebrae of the spine, that it has already begun to protrude over the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery that is circular in shape: that surrounds the entire affected vertebra.
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three times. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful that the cautery is not administered to a swelling caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter 44.
Of the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that are infused into each limb of the body, then when pain comes to the feet, by custom of physicians, this is properly called gout.
And therefore, when gout caused by cold is treated with the usual methods of cure and the pain does not subside, then remove it with cauterization.
And you cauterize that area around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And the cautery should be olive-oil based, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides using this olive-oil based cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize the area, but do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand; only lightly touch the affected skin.
And if the pain reaches the knee and the thigh, then administer the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, and it is called "suagra", then pierce along the flow of the veins, piercing along those two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then pierce along the flow of the veins over each finger and over the palm of the hand.
And if the pain spreads over a few days to the thighs or muscles, then cauterize each one of the affected areas.
And you do not evacuate the illness with good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the bad humors are expelled with this cautery, it will be healed, God helping.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines and/or hernia are protruding from the opening, and this begins gradually, then you should instruct the patient to abstain from food on that day and use remedies that are soothing, so that the opening in their abdomen closes.
And then hold the patient between your hands on their abdomen, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines are fully extruded.
Then, gently return it [the hernia/intestines] with your hands, and press the rupture on the hip bone with a finger, the end of which should be similar to half a circle at the articulated parts of the body.
And then apply the cautery, of which this is the form of it:
until it is very red and emits sparks. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out again.
And you have already opened between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, and another servant is on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery upright, and hold it until you reach the bone of the heel (or possibly "the foot bone") to the middle of the toe; and do it again if you have not reached the bone in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the movement of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest it cause death or other great harm to the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, you have not properly performed your procedure.
And it is necessary for the cautery on children to be subtle according to their size and proportion.
And then care for the cauterized area for three days with a bandage until the scab from the burning is gone.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and the wound are sealed.
And it is necessary to regulate their nourishment according to the length of their healing time, which will also affect their stomach, and to prevent the intestines from being forced out during the process of recovery.
And then, when approximately 40 days have passed, administer a properly made bandage, and let them wear it for another 40 days.
And let him/her be protected from work, overeating, and strong noises, for if he/she follows this regimen of treatment, complete healing will occur.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and if, at the beginning, you want to prevent them from coming back, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and that which has been excised from the lining should be the same size as one-third of it.  Then treat it as previously described, and it will not recur.
And some earlier practitioners would say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape, since it is marked with a probe:
And a line is placed along the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and then your hand is placed with a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first, lighter cautery is better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of twisting (or torsion).
When, in some limbs, pain arises from injury or impact, and that pain persists for a long time and you do not find a cure with medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be of every limb according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, the location of the twisting, and the pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, good.  And if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is the custom of those pains to be punctured on the limb closest to the affected one, so that you must treat these with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of the cauterization of leprosy.
Some leprous people receive great benefit from cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, if you wish to cauterize it, consider if the leprosy is superficial and has been treated by what we have said in the division, and is not spreading, and you fear that the corruption will encompass the entire body and constitution of the patient, then cauterize it on the head with five cauteries: with one in the middle of the head, with a second below it, covering the forehead to the ends of the hair; and two on the temples; and one at the back, on the nape of the neck or its vicinity.
And finally, press the cautery slightly into the bone to create a small indentation, so that the expulsion of thick vapors may be eased from it; and cauterize the spleen according to what is necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is clearly evident, then you must cauterize it with those cauteries that we have mentioned for the head; and with one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two on each cheekbone, and two on each vertebra of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the chest, one on the chest, and two on the hips, one on each hip, and two on the groin, and one on each groin, and two on the thighs, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of each foot; and cauterize it on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the armpits of the arms.
And be careful of the nerves that are near the heel, so you don't burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the bone of the pelvis, and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, just as they do not from needles, because the patient's body is already numbed.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as has been previously described by the types of instruments.
And then treat the cauterization with flour of herbs cooked with honey and the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of cauterization for numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery enter the depth of the wound a little. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness is cauterized, which affects the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back, and the nerves that affect that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume upon this unless one is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the passage of the nerves throughout the entire moving body.
Chapter 49.
Of the cauterization of a skin disease called morphea.
When the skin disease is longstanding and you do not find any benefit from the usual medical ointments, then cauterize the affected area with a cautery, applying it for a brief time according to the extent of the lesion, until the whiteness and its color are gone, and the color of the area is changed.
And then treat it with flour of barley and lentils, mixed with rose oil and arnica leaves, and with a part of dove's blood or swallow's blood, all combined.  Then apply a clean cloth over the area and leave it until healed.
Chapter 50.
Of cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around the affected area, as it is twisted around.
And the learned say it should be cauterized with a deeper cautery in the middle; but I do not see this, for I fear it will become ulcerated, and I have seen this happen several times.
And it is more correct to cauterize it around the affected area with a circular cautery, as we said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 11.
Of cauterization of swellings.
When a swelling has been delayed in maturation, and this is due to excess matter produced, or the patient's age (being old and frail, with little blood), or due to time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the swelling; then cauterize around it with many small, pointed cauteries; and afterward leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you want to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery—of which this is the shape—and place it in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a lower location, so that the arm's condition is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of a corrosive (or ulcerative) condition.
A corrosive is a wandering corruption within the limb, which corrodes it as if by fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if this corrosive is in a place suitable for cauterization by fire, then use small, pointed cauteries, and larger ones depending on the size of the area affected by the corrosive.
And then cauterize it from every side until all the corrosion is eradicated and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply dressings soaked in oil mixed with [other ingredients] to the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is gone.
And then treat it with a flesh-healing ointment.
But if after three days the healed flesh in the area appears healthy and free of corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on the remaining corrupted areas.
And sometimes corrosive medicine is used as a substitute for cauterization. But cauterization with fire is a more readily effective treatment.
And I have already described its treatment with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore use it when needed.
Chapter 53.
Of cauterization of ulcers and other similar conditions.
Often in the parts beneath the sick foot there is an illness called an ulcer, a large, deep wound that troubles the foot; and cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, that is, cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is done by igniting a hollow cautery, similar in shape to a small bird of prey, made of iron to the exact size required for the entire ulcer, and with fine edges/points.
Then place that ignited cautery over the ulcer, and then rotate your hand with the cautery around the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer. And leave it there for three days until it begins to form a scab. Then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it for one night, for that will uproot it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with water.  Take a cannula made of bronze, iron, or a bird's bone, and place it over the ulcer.  Pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, then hold your hand steady, rotating the cannula with pressure from your hand, making sure the cannula's edge presses against the base of the ulcer.  The hot water will travel to the root of the ulcer.  Allow the patient to endure the hot water's action for an hour, then remove it.  This will uproot the ulcer from its roots.
And thus do this to each one, and then to the others, until all such afflictions on their bodies are gone.
And then treat those pus wounds where the roots of the ulcers have been eradicated with ointments that promote flesh regeneration.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of tremor.
When someone has a tremor caused by cold in the nerves, or by a cold-causing fever, or by another similar cause, then you should cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on the soles of their feet, and on their stomach, using an olive oil cautery.
And the tremor subsides, hastening the health of the cold illness.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the cauterization of white spots/accidents on the body.
When white spots and pustules appear on the body, which are caused by thick corrupted matter, then, as soon as it appears, you should cauterize the head of the fistula with a thin cautery made of myrtle wood, the end of which is heated; or with the roots of long-stemmed herbs; or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes a cautery is also used at the beginning of its expulsion in this way; and it is not believed, and the superfluity is broken by these actions, and it heals through these actions.
However, this must be done near the time of evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter LVI.
Of the cauterization of accidental blood flow by means of an archer's incision.
Many times there is an archer's flow [i.e., bleeding] that is incised towards the plague which emerges from the outside, or towards the incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and similar things, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, if this happens to someone, then you press with your hand at the opening of the wound, and place your index finger over that, pressing repeatedly until the blood flow beneath your finger is stopped and no longer escapes.
And then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, many of them, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and the wound where the artery is ruptured, and quickly place the cautery onto that vein *after* you have stopped the flow with your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is cauterized and stopped.
And if the blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from among the cauteries that have been prepared in the fire, and thus continue doing this repeatedly until the blood is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and cause further harm to the patient.
And understand that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be stopped, especially if the artery is large, without one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have described, or by extraction if it is not already extracted (because when it is extracted, the patient's extremities are often damaged and the blood stops), or by tying it with thread or a ligature with a strong constriction, or by placing on it medicines whose properties are to constrict the blood and be pressed down with a cushion or tight wrapping.
However, those who administer constriction by tying and tightening with cloths or through the application of burning substances and similar methods will only be successful after a long time.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present, nor is there medicine, then use the method of pressing a finger over the artery's opening as described, and maintain a firm pressure until the blood is stopped from its excessive flow, and the finger is not removed from the artery; then pour cold water of great coldness over the artery until the blood is congealed and thickened; and further action like cauterization or medical treatment should be used when needed.
Of incisions, perforations, leeches, phlebotomy, sores, and similar afflictions.
We have already discussed in the first chapter all illnesses in which cauterization with fire is appropriate, along with burning medicines, and the occasions and causes of this, and the necessary instruments, with the forms of cauteries.  And I have ordered the chapters from the sovereignty of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker may be relieved of this, concerning whatever they have inquired about.
And before I begin this, children, you must understand that this chapter is a continuation of the first chapter on cauterization.
And therefore, great caution is necessary, for in the procedures of this chapter, often an evacuation of blood, which sustains life, is involved, such as the lancing of a vein, incision on an abscess, opening of a wound, healing of a sore, the extraction of an arrow, the incision of a stone, and similar procedures. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in their hands lies death.
And I warn you that this should not happen to you, for sometimes the hands of men bring many diseases. And some of them become enraged by their illness, and death is near to them, both because of the intensity of their illness, and because of the duration of their illness, and with the illness comes fear, which signifies death.
And of those is the one who gives you their possessions and says, "You, hoping for health, and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to one who comes to you with such a condition; and your caution should be greater than your eagerness and your rashness; and do not presume any cause regarding this except upon certain scientific knowledge which verifies this to you, and which leads to praiseworthy success.
And use in the treatment of all your patients prognostication and indication of the path towards their health, for in that lies your aid in gaining fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold direction and protection from you, for that is in his hand.
And I have organized this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, as preceding in the chapter on cauteries, from the treatment of the head to the feet, so that what you seek concerning this and what you need may be eased for you.
First Chapter.
Of the treatment of water that is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often comes to children during or after birth, and when the nurse tightens the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it arises from a hidden cause that is unknown.
However, I have only seen this illness in children; and all those I have seen have died, and thus it seems to me a hopeless case in them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head of this child was always so enlarged that it could not hold itself upright because of the size of its head, and that the moisture increased until [the child] died.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the skull and the bone, or it is accumulated below the bone over the spinal column.
When the operation is performed in that case, if the moisture is between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should make a cut in the middle of the head with a lengthwise incision, and the length of the incision should be about two fingers until the moisture flows out.  This is the method of lancing.
And therefore, if the moisture is more extensive and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is below the bone, a sign of that is that you see the seams of the skull open on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you press on it with your hand at different spots, and this is not hidden from you. You must cut in the middle of the head with three incisions in this way:
And then extract all the moisture from the incision; then compress the incisions with cloths and lint; then apply wine and oil to the wound until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with bandages and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry foods with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another way of incision, considering where the abscess's size and collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occipital area, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore make the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it in the manner that seems best to you.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest blood flow out and the patient die from that blood loss with the moisture evacuation.
Second Chapter.
When there is chronic catarrh or inflammation in the eyes or foot, and previous treatments with medicine have not worked, then the final treatment in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise those, where the patient's illness affects the head,  you should first rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the arteries, then firmly bind the patient's neck with a cloth; then consider where the vein pulsates; and the locations of each, which are near the ears, are depressed, and are somewhat hidden in some individuals.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then cut each with a sharp-edged instrument, making an incision penetrating to the bone, and let this be done throughout the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the instrument beneath the artery and cut it at the incisions on the parts above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers wide, for when any vein is incised, the blood is emitted with a pulsating outflow, which leaps out in frequent spurts.
But if the artery is not visible, then you must measure from the ear a distance of three fingers, and then mark it with a probe, and cut into the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be drawn is about a wine-cupful, and one may draw more or less, depending on the condition of the patient and the fullness of the artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of inflammation remains on the bone, then dissect that so that a painful abscess does not develop.
And then staunch the wound with lint and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When a person experiences a persistent headache or a sudden violent throbbing, due to acrid humidity and a quality in the temples' membranes, or is afflicted by a severe and similar ailment, and conventional medical treatments are ineffective, then we have found that in these illnesses, the extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have shown, is beneficial.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those [arteries] is that the patient shaves the hair from the temples; and is to locate the apparent artery in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except to a few because of its intensity.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's head should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water until the artery is clearly visible. And then you take the instrument, of which this is the shape: And then you gently scrape the artery with that instrument until you reach the artery; and then, by applying pressure and extracting it in sections, you extract it from the sheath and expose the tissues underneath it, from every side.
But if the artery is delicate, then you wrap it with the tip of the instrument, and then cut off a portion according to the length that the parts are stretched and contracted, and no blood will flow, because if they are not cut off, the blood will not rise completely.
And then remove the blood from one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with strong double-fold linen or long cords, and do not allow it to fester before the wound heals, and excessive bleeding will result.
And then cut away the excess that is between the two ligaments; and do this now or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery instrument up to the bone, with a knife cautery until the ends are cut off, and it will remain in the same place.
And it is better if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot temperament; because cauterization is from among the things which help consume the humidity, and therefore it is better in youth.
And after the extraction of the arteries, you should fill the place with old cotton, and place well-made powders on it, and then treat it with dry medicines that promote flesh growth and with lotions until it is healed.
And if, while working, there is a flow of blood from the artery again, then you must try to stop the blood, either with a cautery or by filling the area with cotton and pressing your hand until the bleeding stops. And if none of those things is available to you, then place your finger on the area until the blood clots, and apply water of intense coldness to the area until the sharpness subsides, and tighten it as needed.
And the easiest way to extract an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two knives, since you have marked the two areas with a probe, and use each one, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the ends is elongated, because it is not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two knives is equal. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two knives, it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives, it will cut close to the skin on each side, and won't cut through the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those areas, the heat of the fire is retained there and the flesh is separated easily.
And this method is better than any other method and easier.
And the space between the two knives should be the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of bodies afflicted with sharp and acidic sores (or ulcers) of the humors.
When the sores are acidic, and the affected veins are on the scalp, and you find no medicinal cause for treatment, and sometimes the patient's face turns red and feels a crawling sensation on their forehead as if ants were crawling, and the sores are weakened, moist, so much so that their skin is exposed, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acidity of the tears, the ancient physicians used a particular treatment for these sores, and called this treatment "spassa".
And you command the patient to shave the hair from their forehead, and then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, according to the length of the forehead. And if the incision is two fingers long: the first incision should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a short distance along the path of the tear ducts that are in the lacrimal region, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries which are on either side, and keep your hand away from the continuing line between both jaws. And the space of each incision is the width of three fingers.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths, with which you absorb the blood.
And then place the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of the incision on him: which is from the temple area up to the second incision. Scrape away with that all the membrane that is between the two incisions, using the instrument that is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision up to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that instrument against the flesh adjacent to the membrane, and the blunt edge on the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut off with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the heels.
But the incision should continue down to this part of the membrane, and then do this in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And since a quantity of congealed blood flows out, express the places of the clots of congealed blood.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old cloth, and place on that powders mixed in wine, oil, and sour wine, and be careful that it does not become a hot abscess.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basil ointment with rubbed oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the treatment of wounds by cauterization and ulcers descending from parts within the head.
When a sharp and persistent cauterization occurs to someone, and the patient's wounds are small and spreading, and the care of them is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and the skin around them affected, and there is sharp, piercing pain in the forehead area and consequent exhaustion, then know from these symptoms that the materials and cauterizations arise only from numerous veins in the inner parts.
And the best treatment in these cases is this:  command the patient to lie down, and then make a small incision in the middle of the forehead, in a straight line (starting with the incision from the left temple towards the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles, which are close to the chewing muscles), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth, and then fill the gap between the two edges of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then cover it with powders mixed in wine and oil, so that a painful abscess does not develop.
And when you remove this and see that the abscess has begun to decrease, then it is necessary to rub the bone until flesh starts to grow there, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh, just as if you took two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and mixed them together, and from this make a plaster and apply it to these wounds to aid in the growth of flesh.
Chapter 6.
Of the treatment of what ails the ears.
Every ailment in the ears is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron or glass; or it is from a plant, such as thistle or beans; or it is a flowing substance, like water, sour wine, and their likenesses; or some kind of beast.
And therefore, when a stone or similar hard substance is lodged in the ear, and you hold the ear towards the sun, and the stone is moved, then pour some oil of violets or wormwood into the ear, and then apply a method of extraction, and make the patient sneeze with some inducement, and block the nostrils in the course of the sneezing action. Then place some cloths or wool around the ear, and gently pull the ear upwards in parts, for often it is forcibly ejected by these methods.
And if it is not expelled, then apply an extraction method with an instrument called a *gesti epicicarios* (a fine, specialized extraction tool), of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the instrument, it is good; and if not, then apply the extraction method with a fine, little-folded (thin) probe.
And if it is not expelled by that, then make a brass cannula and insert the tip of the cannula into the ear canal, and seal around the cannula with softened wax and oil so that only the cannula remains open. And then extract with your breath with strong suction, for this often works as we have described.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a bright or previously prepared *halka* (likely a small, specialized instrument or bandage) of a sufficient size, and place this on the extremity of the wound, and then wrap a suitably placed piece of cloth around that. And then gently insert that into the ear canal, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then you must try to cut it out before it becomes a painful abscess or spasm.
And the way to cut it out is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to its proper virtue, and then place your hands around it and lift the ear outwards, and make a small incision in the root of the ear towards its base in the area well pressed by you. Let the incision be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone, and, upon finding the stone, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; and then quickly close the incision, and treat it until healed.
And if the cause festering in the ear is one of the growths that swell and become inflamed, then administer its cure and extraction; but if you do not succeed in this way, then you should take a fine, thin spatum (possibly a medicinal poultice or application) in this manner: And apply that to remove the growth that has festered in the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already been softened by the vapor from the ear, and place it in small pieces, and then carefully remove these with tweezers or with a delicate action, or with an incision as we have mentioned, for this will facilitate its removal.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should initially use sneezing techniques, and fill their ear with some old cotton, and lie on the side with the affected ear down.  If the water is expelled this way, good.  If not, then take small, smooth, flat stones, the length of a finger, and gently heat them in a fire. The patient should then insert one of these stones into the ear canal, and rest their foot on that side, using another stone to tap the one inside the ear. So continue this with the stone until all the water has been expelled.
So continue this with the stone until all the water has been expelled. And once the water is expelled in this way, take some paper or linen, and place one end in the ear, while you hold the other end over a flame until the majority of it is burned.
Then put more linen in and repeat this process as many times as needed until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula, as described earlier regarding the removal of stones.
However, in removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, treat it like any other small foreign object; following the earlier instructions. But if it is large, and visible within the ear canal, then remove it with forceps or hooks.  This is a less problematic condition than most other ear obstructions.
But in removing a worm that has grown within the ear, if you treat it with the methods described in the sections on general treatment and distillations, and your treatment is unsuccessful, then you should expose the ear to sunlight.
And therefore, if any sign of a worm is visible, remove it with fine forceps or hooks.  But if no sign is visible, then take a cannula that is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, of which this is its form: Insert the narrow end of the cannula into the ear, according to the patient's tolerance; then, vigorously suction with it, repeating this many times until all the worms have been expelled.
But if this doesn't work, then you should seal the cannula's opening with wax, as previously described.  Then apply the distillations used by past practitioners in treating worms, which you will find in the section on distillations.
And use the method for pouring medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, of which this is the shape: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and flat on top.
And therefore, it should be fitted so that the contents of the cannula's cavity are pressed against whatever is required. And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its end decently with cotton. Then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or the juice of some herb, or whatever medicine you choose, into the cannula (which is in the ear). Then insert the reed with the cotton on top and, with your hand, gently press it until the oil is pushed into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil within.
And whatever is put into the ear should be warmed a little with fire. And be careful that the cause you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the treatment of ear blockages.
Sometimes children inherit this from their mothers' wombs without being pierced, and this also happens to some men, a blockage in the ear canal due to an infection or some growing flesh there; and this blockage is sometimes at the opening of the ear canal itself which does not allow passage, and sometimes it is in the areas outside.
And that which happens at the opening of the ear, which does not allow passage, is in the greatest positions for difficult healing.
And in that which allows passage, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And therefore, if blockage appears, open it with a very thin instrument whose shape is like this:
If its extremity, in which the width is small, has one part sharp and the other not; and the instrument has two thin strings so it doesn't damage the ear.
And therefore, if the blockage is due to flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then remove it with fine tweezers, and cut away that flesh vigorously until all of it is removed.
And if the blockage is in the front of the ear, then take a very thin, sharp reed, heat it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have perceived a blockage that the patient finds difficult to hear, relieve the pressure gently; and be careful not to injure the ear's nerves.
And then place a cloth over the ear, the size of the hole you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing; or take some and grind it into powder over the wound, and apply it; and if the ear has already become festering, then you must remove the poultice and replace it with another poultice wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the inflammation subsides; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear, and use other treatments that constrict the bleeding, which are described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling that appears on the eyelids.
Swellings that appear on the eyelids of the eyes sometimes are moist, sometimes are dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or tweezers, and separate them from their roots with a spatula, and then apply a compress to the areas.
But if pain with a flow of blood occurs, then you cauterize them with a thin, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often, in the eyelids of the eyes, there is some cause that is like a swelling in its strength and hardness, and therefore it is called swelling.
And it is a collection of thick moisture on the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the operation for them is to consider whether the swelling is protruding from the eyelid and spreading in all directions; and the cause of it is slight.
Therefore, make a slit across it, and then cut it away from all sides with ease until it opens, and then lift it with forceps and cut it.
And if the figure [or, swelling] is large, then you should close it with sutures; and heal it until it is cured.
And if it is small, you will not experience any harm because the ointment will restore and heal it.
And if the size [of the swelling] is decreasing towards the inner parts of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then lift the eyelid and hold the swelling with forceps, instead of incising it, and press it on all sides. And if the eyelid is stretched by the incision, that does not matter in any way.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and heal the area with something that promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the treatment of a tumor on the eyelid above the eye.
A tumor is a serious condition that is generated in the tissues of the eyelid above the eye, and it is more common in children. It aggravates the eyes of those affected and causes them to have difficulty seeing clearly in the morning; and they cannot look at the sunlight because of it, as tears accumulate in those affected.
And because of this, you often see those lying on their faces all the time, sleeping on their faces; and there are moist spots under the eyelids, on their eyebrows, which are already covered by inflammation, and the appearance of a tumor is evident in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the tumor there.
And a certain method of operation is that the patient rests their head on your lap, and you then place a cloth over them and make a circle around the tumor, encompassing it entirely.  Then place this over the affected area and press with your fingers so the tumor is contained within the circle. Then, in the center of this moisture, make a small incision with a sharp instrument, and the incision should not be larger than that made in a standard surgical procedure.
But in the process, you must cut through the skin entirely until you reach the tumor, for in most cases, the tumor is spread by a white, greasy substance.
Therefore, remove that [the white, greasy substance] with cloths that you have wrapped around it, between your fingers, and twist it between your right and left hand until it is gone.
And be careful not to force the incision, so that with the instrument you don't pierce the eye and damage it.
But if the tumor doesn't appear at the beginning of the incision, but rather you need to widen the incision slightly to make the tumor appear; and then remove it as previously described; and then immerse cloths in warm water and vinegar, and place them over the area, and press them down with powders.
And some [doctors/practitioners] sprinkle salt and place it in the wound cavity to absorb any remaining moisture.
And then treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing poultices until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Methods of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural skin and they are hardened, then these irritate the eye and cause various ailments such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and tissues, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called "tactinir of the eye."  It is treated in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or with a sharp medicine as previously described in the chapter on cauterization; or a "tactinir" is treated by incision and suture; or by means of a canula (small tube), as I will describe.
And therefore you should place the patient's head on your lap; then, grasp the eyelid with your left hand, and if it is already turned back, good.  But if not, insert a needle into the thickened part, below the eyelid, and thrust the needle with the thread above, and this should be—near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow—close to the hairs. Pull the thread towards the upper eyelid and then pull the eyelid back into position with your hand (or a tool).
Then, in the part inside the eyelid beneath the hardened hairs, make incisions with the major lacrimal (tear duct) extending down to the minor lacrimal; then withdraw the thread and place small, powdered cotton or cloth beneath the eyelid.  Then cover the eyelid with a bandage, in a shape resembling a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape of the bandage should correspond to the degree of eyelid swelling, since this varies from person to person.  Some patients require a more extensive incision in the eyelid, depending on how much the eyelid has swollen.
Then, with the spatula, make incisions along the two lines you have drawn, starting from the major lacrimal duct and extending towards the minor lacrimal duct. And if your incision is close to the natural hairs, it should be as wide as the king's finger.
Then place the lancet at one of the two corners of the wound, and scrape it all.  Then use a thin wool thread or thread to draw together the two lips of the wound, and remove the blood. Apply any excess thread to the two eyebrows if you wish; otherwise, don't worry about it.
And leave the stitches of the thread for three or four days, then treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with what dries and constricts it, since the eyelid is raised against the sealing of the wound and its adherence; however, stitching is better.  Therefore, the ancient physicians said this.
But nevertheless, there should be concern for the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is no fear for them.
And there is another method in treating this, which is to draw on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then lift the eyelid with three separated and joined hooks according to this shape:
But if that is not possible, to hold the hooks, and it is not appropriate, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads equally between these, and then, with a firm upward motion, elevate the entire flap, on which the figure was drawn, as we have described.
And then stitch together the two edges of the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess appears near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with poultices and similar remedies, and with ointments.
And sometimes the eyelashes on the eyelid become inverted; then you should use what we have said about incisions, but a suture is often more effective/better in such cases.
To treat with canes (likely referring to a type of medical treatment using canes or rods) is according to this method: And you must turn the eyelid and cut the figure within as I have described; and then, skillfully, make two thin canes or rods, whose length is the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the opening (space). And you have already incised at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads (or sutures).
Then carefully attach each one to the excess eyelid tissue, and tightly bind the canes to each part. Leave it for several days, because the excess skin, due to the tightening, will die and become withered and decayed until it falls off naturally.
However, if it has lingered, then break it open with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Thus, once it is healed, the eyelid is elevated and the skin is not inflamed.
And this is the method for two canes, which you will do according to this method: and have the quantity of the length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of raising inflamed skin on the boil with a needle when the skin is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and inflamed boils, then the operation for them is that you take a fine needle and place it on that delicate and soft part of the boil, and then you adjust the ends of it, twisting each one in a very subtle manner. And the length of the threads should be about the length of a palm.
And then you place another thin thread underneath it shortly, and twist the ends of that one if you want.
And then, place the patient's head in your lap, and be close to the sun so your work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
Then, insert the needle into the root of the affected hair, which requires skill, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you remove that from the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out, and put it in a container.  Let the hairs be one, two, or three, and no more.
And then, pull your hand with that until the hair is pulled out, along with the loose skin on the eyelid from the natural hair.
However, if the loose skin is pulled but the hair is not removed, you will pull the skin in different directions below with the salve you have prepared, until the loose skin is removed from the wound.
And you will apply a poultice to the eye, for then you will remove the salve and the ointment, and each of them will close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you will attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it, or let it be until it is stretched out approximately a little way, and then you lift it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of a wound that appears on the upper eyelid.
When a wound appears in the eye, and the eyelid is contracted upwards, either on the right or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, a cut, or cauterization, and is called 'leporine' (meaning hare-lip-like), this wound or ulcer may be either natural or accidental, and is caused by poor healing from a wound, a cut, or cauterization, or similar poorly treated injuries.
The method of treatment is to dissect the scar tissue and separate the edges, placing a piece of linen cloth between them, and binding them together until they heal.
And you should not use treatments that dry or constrict, for if you do this, the wound will return worse than it was before any treatment.
Use remedies that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice made from water with chamomile and flaxseed, or diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil, and immerse the cloth in it, and treat with that.
The key to your treatment is that you should perforate any unhealed portion according to the original form of the wound.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing more than a rectification of the wound, restoring the area to its previous shape.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a wound made on the lower eyelid.
This wound on the lower eyelid, truly called a wound, can be either natural or accidental in origin.
But an accidental wound is caused by a blow, a cut, a cautery, or other similar things.
And the way to treat it is to take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and have it pass from the tear duct on the left side to the tear duct on the right side, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh apart with the needle and sew it together with the needle, and cut away with a wide spatula. And so if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that's good; and if not, take a strip of cloth and place it in the gap, and with that, close the eyelid, and mend the two slits in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two slits be at two angles of the incision, which you have made until they meet, and let there be an angle formed by their meeting.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then remove the flesh in an amount equal to the sharpness of the lower eyelid, which is what forms the eyelid.
And then join the separated parts and stitch them with a wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medicines and poultices we have mentioned until it is healed.
And if it needs to be treated by a slit, suture, or cautery, then you should make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid, according to what has been previously described. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as we have said.
In the summary of the treatment of a protrusion, whether above or below, let the operation proceed according to the form of the protrusion, and that is in various forms.
And the skilled craftsman always prepares an instrument in every possible way until the form returns to its natural shape, or close to it, and the patient is appropriately prepared for the operation and the instruments in the best possible positions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in many people, so that the eyelid is firmly joined to the white part of the eye, and its natural movement and actions are hindered, then you must insert the tip of the instrument under the eyelid, and lift or extend it with the forceps.
And then you carefully cut through the adhesion with a thin blade, avoiding sharp incisions,  keeping it slightly blunt so that the patient is not disturbed by the procedure, and remove the blade so that it does not damage the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should carefully sever that adhesion until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you apply salt water to the eye, with which you wash it; or instill a solution of lead dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with care, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and on the third day use healing substances until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of incisions of the nail and protruding flesh of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types: one is nervous, and resembles hard, fine, chip-like material; or it is non-nervous, resembling frozen white moisture, which when touched by an iron, or when forced with forceps, is detached and the forceps do not get stuck in it.
And both types originate from the larger tear duct, gradually extending to cover the eye and obstructing the light and movement of the eye.
But the method of operating on it is that the patient rests their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with forceps of little curvature and extend it to the surrounding areas. Then take a needle and insert into it a horse's, ox's, cow's, or similar hair, or a strong thread, and gradually thread it to the tip of the needle and place it in the middle of the nail.  Pierce the nail with the needle and tie the nail with thread; extend the thread to the surrounding areas and scrape off with the hair the part of the nail covering the pupil. And thus you secure it with the hair until the back of it.
And then you cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a thin blade or small scissors, and leave the natural tear duct tissue intact so that cutting it does not cause continuous tears.
And sometimes the nail, with just forceps or thread, as we have said, and then scraped with a lion's blade, of which this is its shape:
And be careful not to touch the cornea with the blade, lest it be broken, and the pupil be pierced.
Then put a bit of powdered salt or a prepared powder into the wound, and leave it overnight; then treat it as necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle, or if it is not caught by forceps, then frequently this type of nail is cured with medications, and is healed as I have written in the division (or section).
And if you want to incise it, then open the patient's wound and take a sharp, slender lion's blade, shaped like this: with precision. And if it is often inflamed, and swollen, and has entered the root, then distill from your own mouth into the wound a prepared powder, or red powder, or powdered salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until all the [affected] material is removed, unless a warm abscess has formed in the wound. In that case, leave it alone, and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your procedure on it with reason until it is healed.
If a weeping of flesh is seen in the wound, a severe harm, then suspend it with a bandage; and cut it [the weeping flesh] from the wound in a part of it, and do not complete the incision so as not to cause a flow of tears.
And then distill into the weeping flesh red powder and prepared powder until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the incision of an abscess and of what has arisen from congealed flesh in the wound.
Sometimes in the wounds of some, red flesh grows, and it overgrows until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or tightens upon the eyelids, and forcefully compresses the eyelids to the sides and is assembled like the edge of a balustrade.
But the operation on him is that the patient places his head on your lap; and then open the wounds of that and collect all that flesh with suitable forceps, and hold it with a forceps or with scissors; and then cut the flesh with the incision tool until it is all finished, and be careful of the wound that you do not damage it during your operation.
And your incision be made with the instrument with which we described the incision of a nail, or with small forceps with which a similar (or appropriate) collection is done according to the form that will appear in this chapter.
So, when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the wound with crushed salt, or a red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a bandage over the wound outside, with egg white, until a hot abscess is ensured.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and there is hot, inflamed blood, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the wound and treat that abscess with something to reduce that abscess, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly treat the accumulated flesh that occurs in the wound of this sort.
However, you must avoid all healing of the wound through natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand on any of these operations until you see that that limb can tolerate the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus in the wound.
Pus comes from red veins that are hardened over the wound and prevent the wound's operation, and the wound must be cleansed over many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the wound in which the pus is strong and there is no other illness but pus, then you collect that pus.
And you order the patient to rest his head on your lap, and then you compress those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and that ounce shall be of a subtle fold in this manner:
or two ounces gradually in one vessel according to this form:
And then those veins should be collected with subtle force, subtly, and the blood should be drawn out little by little, until you see those veins to be emptied from the wound and to be closed up.
And be careful that you do not injure the wound with the extremities of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you only cut the veins.
And when you have finished, then you instill green or red juice into the wound, so that with its sharpness it may corrode what remains of the matter.
But if this is not possible for you to collect all at once, then you plaster it over with whatever relieves the pain, and leave it for several days until the pain is calmed and a hot abscess is sure to have formed.
And then repeat this procedure in the same manner until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of a nosebleed.
When you treat a nosebleed with a cautery or a sharp, burning medicine, as described previously, and it is not cured, then there is no remedy there, but you must make incisions around the abscess before it matures, and remove all the moisture and pus until the bone is exposed.
And therefore, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness there, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called a sharp head, and is made of iron, and the head is round like a hazelnut, which is made pointed by the scratching of a file or a sharp, thin tool (as in the following form).
And place that on the corrupted area of the bone, and then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And do this several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown there, and the body is free of pus and remains for 40 days, and is not renewed and has not become suppurated and no accident occurs there, then you know it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a case for treatment, but to reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and in this manner:  and it is that you expose the second bone with iron or a sharp medicine, and once the bone is exposed, then you take a strip in this way:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and the shaft be thin and tapered towards the tip, thus and so.
And then place that [iron/instrument] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and extend your hand a little from the eye, and then move your hand with the strip until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient feels air escaping when you move their hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with styptic, drying medicines, as you have been taught.
So, when the flesh and the area has hardened, then the material that had spread to the outside returns to the nose, therefore it is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the prominence of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and you do not notice any harm or diminution in its appearance, then you should leave the patient alone, and gently follow its course, and then place leeches on the neck without incisions, and suck well; and then apply a liniment made of acatra, aloe, ens, and sarcocolla to the eye, and then bind the poultice tightly over the eye with much powder.
And the method for the powders is to take very fine linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four pleats; and make many of these.
And then place those cloths one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs. And then bind them together with a hard cloth with a strong pressure; and reapply the leeches with suction without incisions; and then remove the leeches and leave the eye bound tight day and night.
But if during this time the swelling is softened, then it must be bound very tightly.
And then remove the bandage approximately day and night, as we have said.
And if the eye is already reduced, it is good, and if not, then reapply the plaster with powders, the pressure, and the leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the choroid.
When there is a protrusion in the choroid, and it is prominent and protruding from the eyelids like a bunch of grapes, and the shape of a man is affected by it, and you want to incise it, then the operation there is as we have described, that you insert a needle into the root of the choroid from the lower part to the upper part, and then place another needle with a double thread from the tear duct side, and push that one through, leaving the first needle according to its position; and then, incise the area with the double thread and remove the part of the choroid in the circumference of the needle, and hold it tightly.
And then withdraw the needle and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white, and leave it until the thread with the grape-like protrusion falls out.
And then treat the eye with that which comforts it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes, with a circular cloth around the eye, a large prominence is brought together, and then it is perforated with a fine spatula that comes to the edge of the eye, and the whitish fluid runs out, and the eye goes down and enters quickly.
And then hold it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of falconry injuries.
This illness, called alconati, is nothing but a sanious fluid that gathers in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and proper seat, then take their head in both of your hands and hold it until you see the blood coming down the lower parts.  Then dry it so that it doesn't descend, and cover the light, and let the patient see the cause as they see it.
And if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
However, if the descent of the blood is not prepared as we have said, then place the patient between your hands and take a subtle, fine spit, and use it to touch the panniculus slightly near the joining of the conjunctiva and the cornea, at the limbus (where the empty space is), until the blood is expelled.
Therefore, once it is expelled, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of the water descending from the eye.
We have already described the types of water in the division and which ones need to be pierced with a cautery, explaining, then, what is appropriate according to the health.
Then you should place the patient between your hands on a blanket, and press firmly on their eye socket.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their eye, if the eye with the water is the left eye; or with your right hand if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand, take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Then place the tip of the almond near the eyelid's edge along the thickness of the ray, into the white part of the eye near the smaller tear duct, and then press the almond with force, and roll your hand with it.
Then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space/cavity.
And it is necessary that the distance traveled by the almond be the same as the distance from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the eyelid; for you will see with that pupil with the sight of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond into the area where the fluid is, and then pull it down a few times.  Then, if the fluid descends quickly, you will see the patient looking at something quickly, and the almond in their eye.
And then rest for a little while; then if the fluid has descended, then you pause again before the almond is thrown.
And then, when it is dried and does not descend, you extract the almond with ease, and gently rub it with your hand. Then dissolve a small amount of clear rock salt in water, and wash the eye with it. Then, place a cloth or bandage or wool soaked in rubbed olive oil and egg white on the eye and apply to the eye firmly.
But we and those of our time place it on the crushed mixture with egg white.
And if you are not able to get the almond into the eye due to its hardness—for in some people the eye is very hard—then it is necessary to take the substance called "alberid", whose form is:
And then pierce the conjunctiva with it, and do not press your hand into the hole, but rather make a subtle path for the almond.
And then introduce the almond, as we have said.
And complete your work by preparing the patient's sleeping quarters properly, where they sleep on their back in a dark room, and all movement is forbidden.
And apply this to him/her so that their nature is calmed, and do not allow their head to turn to the right or left at all.
And let the binding remain according to its arrangement until the third day.
And then remove that bandage in that dark room, and expose the affected area to the light, and show him/her some things, and then return the bandage until the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the hours of treatment or immediately after the infusion. However, you must prevent this, because water can easily cause great and violent swelling.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you must remove the dressing before the seventh day, and treat it with whatever causes the abscess to subside.
Then you uncover the patient's eyes and place a mask over the patient's face, through which the patient's vision is controlled below it for several days, the patient remaining in the dark room.
And gradually be released from that room and return to their normal circumstances.
And know that in a serious case, the student is not excused from observing some actions multiple times, and then you must be courageous about the operation.
And we have heard from some of those who are at Artach, and some said that fire was made in the Ayrac, a magdaam [a type of tool or material] pierced through which water was drawn out.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has accomplished this, nor have I read about it in any ancient books; and it is possible that this is a new method.
And these are the forms of the types of magdaam so that anyone who is unfamiliar with them may understand them:
And they are made of bronze or iron, and their extremities are shaped with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end being such that this is the form.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various kinds of flesh grow in the nose, some of which have a cause resembling a scorpion's tail or a fish's polyp; and this disease is called polyp, because it resembles that represented fish. And from it comes cancerous, ulcerated flesh, of a dark color; and from it is flesh that is lion-like, not of a dark color.
Therefore, in that type of flesh that is not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands and expose them to the sun, and dry their nostrils, and apply your lancet to those flesh growths. Then remove those growths to the outside, and then cut away what you have grasped of them with a sharp, thin spatula, from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; if any part from which removal is possible remains, then scrape it with one of the sharp instruments easily until nothing remains. But if it swells with blood or forms a hot abscess, then apply what is appropriate; or if it is a malignant abscess, then cauterize and cut it until the blood is removed and all the cavities are emptied.
And then put vinegar and water or wine into the nostrils after the incision. But if the nostril is open and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is still some flesh in the pus, or superfluous bone in the nasal passages, which has not been reached by the incision.
Therefore, then it is necessary to introduce a piece of lead, some thickness, and apply many small pieces, and put between each piece the quantity of a finger or less, and apply it to the patient, and insert one end of the lead into the nostril with a reed or some other suitable instrument.
And after that has been done, draw the patient's breath in until it reaches the nasal passages, and comes out over the throat, for children often do something similar in schools, and it is an easy thing to do.
And then place the two ends of the lead, one end protruding from the nose and the other remaining inside, and then apply a flesh-cutting instrument to the pieces of lead, doing this until you know the flesh is now attached to the lead pieces.
And then remove the lead, and apply a cauterization to the nose, in the area of the blood extraction, and do this for three days or more until the medicament has corroded everything remaining of the flesh.
And finally, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you desire a more thorough cure, use this one.
And this is the method for a nose-cleaning instrument, using which oils and medications are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or brass, resembling a small, open lamp, or a small shell, and similarly shaped mouthpiece.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the nose-cleaning instrument be flat, open; to which there is a handle at its back, with which you hold it while heating oil or whatever you want of juices and subtle substances in it.
Chapter 25.
Of ulcers in the nasal extremities.
Often an ulcer forms at the extremities of the nose, and it grows and enlarges in a few days until it is very difficult to see.
And therefore, you should cut it open at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it. And then place either a cautery or a burning medicine on the area.
However, if its incision is delayed until it has grown large, then consider if it is hardened, hard, dark-colored, and with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron, for it is a chronic abscess; for often the one who incises this abscess can cause great harm to the person it was in.
And if the abscess is tender to the touch and not dark-colored, and its incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the area with things that dry and constrain it until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by plague or similar [diseases/wounds].
Know that when you encounter a disruption of continuity in one of these cartilages, you will achieve little in that operation except in skilled hands.
Therefore, when you encounter any such cause, consider if it is fresh plague with its own blood.  If so, you should bring together the two sides of the wound with sutures and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the broken continuity are already separated and each is apparently healthy, then you must scrape each part of their edges until blood comes out. Then bring together the two edges with sutures and tighten them.  Powder the area with dragon's blood and crushed herbs, and place a piece of diaphanous plaster or another of the consolidating plasters upon the powder.  Leave this dressing for two or three days, and then remove it and change the plaster, leaving it until the pus is separated, and then treat with unguent until healed.
But the method of suturing is to join the broken continuity either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the belly, or join the break with glue, as you have been shown.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things that are inside the two edges/lips of the wounds.
Often, in the inner parts of their lips, men have some hard abscesses resembling grains of corn, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you must turn the lips and slit each of those hardnesses from every side, and then fill the wound with scraped sage until the blood is stopped, and then wash the area with sour wine and treat the area with something astringent, until it heals.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of flesh adhering to the gums.
Often, flesh adhering to the gum, which the ancients called "albulus," forms a growth.  Then, you must detach it with a knife or forceps, and cut it at its base, allowing the pus or blood to drain.
And then apply crushed sage or other astringent or drying powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again and cauterize it, for the cautery will prevent it from returning.
Chapter 29.
About toothache with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, there are rough, hard, and sometimes black or yellowish scabs, which cause the gum to become inflamed and the teeth to become hard.
And therefore, you should place the patient between your hands, place their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth where those scabs and similar things like sand appear until no trace of them remains, and do this to remove the blackness, yellowness, and other such things until they are cleaned.
Therefore, if what is described at the beginning of the treatment is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those areas the following day, and the second, and the third, until it reaches the desired outcome.
And know that teeth require many tools of various shapes and forms, depending on the preparation for your operation. And therefore, the scraper used to clean the inner portion of the tooth is different from the scraper used to clean between the teeth, in different ways, and these different scrapers must be prepared by you, and you will see them soon.
Chapter 30.
Of the eradication of teeth.
You must treat the tooth's pain with all your skill and take your time in any tooth extraction, because there is no remedy to replace the tooth once it is removed, for it is a sublimated substance until it is extracted.
However, when the patient must have a tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is the painful one, because many times the pain deceives the patient and indicates a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is removed, for we have seen this in the practice of barbers.
Therefore, how should you be certain which tooth is painful, and that you know it well?  Then you must scrape the gum around the tooth with a substance that has some virtue, until it is loosened from the tooth and gum on all sides, and then work it with your fingers, or with small, sharp scissors, little by little, until it loosens.
And then, use strong pliers for good grip or strong leverage, and place the patient's head between your knees to hold it firmly so it doesn't move, and then pull the tooth straight, in a way that does not break it, and do not cause the patient excessive pain.
And so, if it is not completely loosened, then take one of those instruments and place it under it from all sides with ease and exert the removal of it just as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you must cover the crack with cloth and tighten it with the fine end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken during the application of pliers to remove it.
And you must carefully scrape around the gum on all sides, and be very careful to avoid breaking it and damaging any part, and return to the patient, for the treatment's severity may exceed the initial pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their recklessness and audacity in tooth extraction, without the care we have described; for many times they bring upon people serious illnesses that are more difficult to cure than the original, leaving the roots of the tooth entirely, or some of them, or even tearing off some bone from the jaw as we have often witnessed.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be rinsed with warm wine or vinegar with salt.
And if blood flows from this, as often happens, then apply a small amount of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if that does not stop it, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers with which the tooth is initially grasped should be long at the end, with a short and thick handle so that they do not bend when using them.
And they should be like those with thick handles so that when you grip them, they don't bend, but with short ends.
And they should be made of well-forged Indian iron with straight ends, and on those ends are teeth that interlock and grip tightly with strong constriction. Sometimes the ends of these are shaped like the beak of a stork (or, likely, a similar bird of prey). These too have a strong grip.
Chapter 31.
Of the eradication of teeth and the extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you must eradicate a fractured tooth which remains for some reason, then you should place wool with a bandage on the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then use forceps or pliers whose ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or heron, the shape of forceps:
The ends of them [the forceps] should be made like a file or rasp.
And if you are not successful with these forceps or pliers, then you must cut through the gum and expose the entire root, and use an instrument called, this is a small lever whose shape is like this:
And it should be of short length, with a thick end, a little bit, and not overly sharp so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is completely loosened, good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument is triangular at the end, with some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is to be triangular and with a more slender end.
And you have now been assisted by this instrument having two ramps, of which this is the shape, approximately the following: and with other instruments, which I will describe in the rasping of teeth; for helpfulness is done with this instrument, which is like a large chisel, and this is the form:
of a triangular, bent or short end, which has some thickness, and should not be blunt so that it is not chipped.
And further know that the instruments for teeth are very similar to the other instruments.
But the skillful and subtle craftsman in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and diverse illnesses indicate to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not devise or prescribe a specific instrument, because of the diverse shapes of illnesses.
However, if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are fractured, or decayed, then apply a compress to it in its place with what is appropriate to it from the instruments and forceps that we have mentioned in the extraction of teeth roots, and help with a gesture of which this is the form:
And if there is some small thickness, it should be pressed or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or loosen until the bone is completely set; and afterward restore the area with suitable remedies for this.
But if there is a small ulcer on the bone, then cut away that ulcer and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth prominent above the others.
When teeth are prominent beyond their natural position, due to an irregular shape, especially in women, and more so in young women, then you must consider: if a tooth is directly next to another tooth, and removal or binding is not possible, then cut it out; but if it's not attached to another tooth, then you cut it with an instrument shaped like a pig's snout, made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And make your incision in such a way that you cut it in several days, because of the tooth's hardness, and so that it doesn't damage other teeth.
And if a prominent tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, of which this is the shape:
And it should be entirely of Indian iron, easily worked; and it should have many small points, like the file used to make needles, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days easily, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then, finally, bind it and pull it out with some razors.
And if a tooth has a broken part that cuts the tongue, then you must file it until the sharpness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and made whole so that the tongue is not harmed and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of broken teeth with gold or silver fillings.
When teeth are damaged by impact or displacement due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot firmly hold on to what's missing, and you've treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment hasn't worked, then, because it won't hold, fix those that are broken with gold fillings and not silver, for silver turns green and will become rotten after a few days, but gold never changes.
And the filling should be of such a fineness and thickness as to fit between the teeth; and the method of applying it is to take the filling and place twice its size between two healthy teeth, and then work it in with two bends of the filling between the broken teeth, or if there is one or more, until the material reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the process until you reach the starting point, and apply firm but gentle pressure until it is no longer broken.
And your grip, with which you hold the filling against the tooth roots, must be firm to prevent it from coming out.
And then cut off the excess parts of the filling with forceps or scissors, and shape them to fit each location, and position them between the healthy tooth and the broken tooth, so as not to injure the tongue. And then leave it like that, firmly in place.
But if it is loose or broken, hold it or them in place with another filling in such a manner at all times.
And this is the method for treating teeth, and the procedure for joining two healthy teeth to two broken teeth, as these teeth are sometimes joined together:
And when you have returned a tooth or two to their place, close up each one, and they should have grown back as we have described, and remain in place.
And only skilled and knowledgeable craftsmen can do this.
And sometimes a piece of cow's bone is suitable, shaped like a tooth, and placed in the space where the tooth is missing, and held in place as we said, and it remains and serves well for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the inflammation of the ligament that affects the tongue and prohibits speech.
This ligament, which sometimes forms beneath the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental, resulting from a wound that has already healed.
And the procedure involves opening the patient's mouth, their head being supported by you; lifting their tongue, and then carefully cutting the nerve ligament along its width until the tongue is freed from its constriction.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting in that area, a result of a healed wound, then you apply leeches and cut it along its width until you have severed the ligament and dissolved the knot.
And be careful not to create a fissure in the flesh, and to avoid cutting into a blood vessel and causing bleeding.
Then wash the incision site with water or vinegar or cold water; and then place a linen pad under the tongue; this is a bandage that the patient will keep under their tongue every night to prevent it from sticking together again.
However, if bleeding occurs, apply powdered vitriol to the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a smooth cautery iron suitable for this purpose. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula (a cyst) beneath the tongue.
Sometimes, an abscess resembling a small tumor forms beneath the tongue, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows significantly until it fills the mouth.
And the treatment for this is to open the patient's mouth, sitting facing the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is a dark color, or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, then do not touch that, for it is cancer.
And if it is pale, with moisture, then apply a poultice to it, and cut it with a thin scalpel, and separate it from all sides; and if blood is released during your operation, then place a crushed piece of gypsum, or vitriol, on top to stop the bleeding.
And then return to your work until you have successfully removed it, rinsing it with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the other appropriate remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses from the two ears and those on the throat and other abscesses.
When a boil develops on the throat, which are glands clustered together, which burst outward and are called boils, and if you treat them with what we've described in the division and they don't heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and has little sensitivity. In that case, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is reddish in color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron for fear of blood flow; rather, leave it until it is ripe, and then either you will drain it or it will break open by itself.
And if it is whitish, soft, and its root is subtle, then it is appropriate to make an incision.
And the procedure for it is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already been warmed with adequate rest or if it has diminished with some reduction; and then make the patient sit in the sun, and place their head on your lap, open their mouth, and the servant taking hold of their hands, press down on the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument, whose form is as follows:
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be thin like a knife.
So, when you press with that on the tongue and the abscess is shown to you, and you cover it with your cloth, then take a spoon and place it in the cavity, and pull it out to the sides as much as you can. After that, if you pull out any cause of the tissues, then carefully cut it with an instrument whose shape is this:
After that, if you pull out any cause of the tissues, then carefully cut it with an instrument whose shape is this: and it is similar to forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is on the opposite side, very sharp, and made from tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then cut it with a spatula that has this shape:  And it should be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other.
And after you have incised one incision, make another incision in the same manner, and then the patient's incision will be healed by cold water.
However, if there is bleeding, heal it with water decoction of pomegranate bark or myrtle leaves, and similar styptic substances until the bleeding is stopped, and then treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the neck or near the two ears, and cut those according to the incision of two incisions previously described.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her neck, an abscess that was tending toward a dark color, with little sensitivity, which had already constricted her throat, and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and I had forbidden her food and water, and she was close to death if it had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had formed two bulges before bursting through two openings.
Then I incised it fistularly and placed a cupping instrument on one of them, and pulled it out, and a large portion was pulled out.  Then I incised the area where I understood another opening was, and then opened the patient's mouth, and pressed down on their tongue, and then inserted the cupping instrument into that abscess.
And then I excised a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and soon ate food.  So I continued to incise that abscess many times for a long time, and another abscess would form in the same place, which I incised until it resolved.
Therefore, I cauterized the throat, adding more cautery; and then I pondered and did not know what God had wrought upon her.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the incision of an abscess when it is inflamed.
When catarrh settles on the uvula, and it is inflamed and prolonged, then it is called a perpendicular abscess; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a boil.
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not succeed, and sometimes an abscess has already subsided and is becoming more subtle, then you should incise that which is round and swollen; and if it extends in length, and is blood-red, dark-colored, or black, and there is no feeling there, then you should hesitate to incise it, for there is fear for the patient's well-being in that case.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, you should have the patient lie down and press the tongue with an instrument that reveals its shape. Then, position the lancet on the swelling, and draw it down and incise it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the incision of double boils.
And you should only incise that which is adjacent to the natural boundary, without exceeding it, for if you incise further, you will damage the patient's speech.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of double boils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, use cauterization without hesitation.  The method of cauterization in this case is only with sharp water.  You should position the patient's head on your lap, and then press the tongue with the instrument we have mentioned.  Then take the water described in the chapter on cauterization, apply it in a live, non-thick, non-thin layer.  Fill the hollow of the instrument which has this form:
The tip of it (the instrument) should be concave, like the bowl of a spoon. Place the instrument with the medicine on the ulcer.  The patient should lie on their side, so that saliva or mucus from the mouth flows away from the medication, preventing any substance from running down the patient's throat and irritating it.
Then, place your hand with the medicine and press it onto the uvula for half an hour, until you see it blackened and softened by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take cotton, wrap it around the tip of the spoon, dip the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a tube until the cotton adheres to the tube. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it until it dries and falls away in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it. Afterward, clean the cauterized area around the uvula with cotton dipped in water or a similar liquid.  Remove any remaining medicine. Wash the area with cool water. Treat it externally with an ointment, and internally with remedies, until it is healed.
This type of treatment is safer than an incision and less prone to fear (or complications).
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more delicate than cauterization or incision, through fumigation in this way: take mint, hyssop, rue, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, balm, and similar herbs, combine some or all in a pot, and immerse them in sour wine and boil.  The pot should be properly sealed, and a small hole is to be made in the middle of the pot over which a concave metal instrument, either silver or bronze, is placed in this manner.
And the end of the instrument is inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is significantly softened.
And then repeat this several times until it is dry.  Be careful not to perform this treatment at the start of an abscess, as it would only make the abscess worse; you should instead treat an abscess with heat (cautery).
However, if you do not have this instrument, take a reed and place a hard-boiled egg shell on its end, so that the patient's mouth is protected, as the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the removal of thorns and things that adhere to the throat and other such causes.
Many times, thorns or fish bones or some other thing adhere to the throat.
Then it is necessary for you to remove whatever of those is apparent, upon which you fix your gaze, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that it may be revealed to you what is in the throat.
And that which is not apparent and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for the cause adhering to the throat will be easily expelled by vomiting; or that the patient swallows a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or that the patient takes a piece of dry sea sponge and tightly binds it with a bandage, and when the patient swallows it, because it reaches the place where the thorns are and is expelled, then it is expelled. And further, take an eel and drink it with a bandage, and it should be placed inside and quickly extracted; or take a leek and quickly put it in and quickly take it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
And it should be larger than a small ray, and at its end should be a cavity which you easily insert into its throat.
And have the patient hold their head up, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that it does not hurt, and with that you push on the bone or thorn, or the physician with their hand.
But it is better if the patient, by their own knowledge of the place of the associated cause, pushes it down, and the doctor pulls their hand with the instrument upwards, all of this according to the amount prepared for them, until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the removal of bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When the leech is medicated with what we have described in the division of treatment with medicine, and you have not succeeded, then place the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed the tongue with the instrument we have discussed.
Therefore, if you see the leech, remove it with a small forceps or with subtle, skillful gestures.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it with that, then take a concave tube and insert it into the patient's throat. Then, place a heated iron in the concavity of the tube, and do this repeatedly (until the leech is dead and detached from the throat).  And keep the patient abstaining from water all day.
Then take a vessel full of cold water, and open the patient's mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it.  And let him not swallow anything, and hold the water for an hour or so with your hand, because the leech will immediately fall off when it senses the water.
But if it is not dislodged by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with wormwood or asafoetida using the instrument we described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it falls off.
And another method of fumigation for this is to take a pan in which there are burning coals, and the pan is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole.  Place the end of the instrument in this hole.  Then, perform the fumigation above it.  Have the patient put their mouth over the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will fall off immediately.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and let them eat salty foods and garlic, and do not let them drink water; and thus, with this regimen, it is necessary that it be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is treated when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, but differs in that it has some curvature in it. Which is placed on the leech, and its tip is similar to a crane's beak, which is covered, and in which a file is placed, so that when we grasp any thing, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and the incision of them.
Abscesses are of many kinds, in many ways, according to their remembrance, each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is according to the nature of the abscess itself; and by what we grasp of the humours.
And the second way is according to the locations on the body where they occur, for an abscess in the head is different from an abscess in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy area is different from an abscess in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment regarding treatment.
And some abscesses should not be opened until the pus is sufficiently mature or the abscess is fully formed.
Other abscesses should be incised while they are still inflamed, and not fully mature, such as those near joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its presence often extends until it impacts the surrounding area, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, causing contraction of that limb; or it is near a vital limb, and if you delay its opening until it matures, you risk harming the limb; or it's near the anus, therefore open it while unripe.  Do not open an unripe, incompletely formed abscess, but if it's near the anus,  so that the pus does not spread and extend into the depths of the anus, creating a fistula, or causing a lasting lesion that will not heal. But you must know the right time to open the abscess, and this is when it is mature.
And you will know it has matured when the pain subsides and the fever ceases, and when the swelling and throbbing decrease, and the head of the abscess becomes prominent, and the other signs.
And therefore, the incision should be made in the pus-filled area beneath the abscess, and from the pus coming from the swelling.
And the incision should always be made along the grain of the flesh or the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and away from the tendons, nerves, and arteries; and, in general, in all places where there is no reflex action; for in those areas that have a reflex, use the incision appropriate for that particular limb.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to let it be until the digestion of the area is confirmed according to the fulfillment of the condition, as we have said; for if you incise it before this, you prolong the illness and much filth, and the lips of the abscess will harden and deepen.
But some abscesses are incised according to the width of the flesh or body, depending on the necessity, or according to the needs of the limb.
And you should make a small incision in small abscesses, and a large and wide incision, or many sections, in large abscesses, according to the variation in size of the abscesses.
And others are of abscesses in which the skin should be hollowed out and incised, when it is done in such a way that it is in a state of maturity, such as those that occur in cases of many boils and buboes.
And some are incised with a three-angled section; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the groin.
And of those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision are used, and similar to those.
But in those cases where there is no such deep abscess, like superficial lion abscesses, you should pierce them with a superficial, or flat, incision only.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should pierce it and do not attempt to remove all the matter at once; having removed a portion, you should then bandage the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and do this repeatedly according to the degree, until it is entirely discharged.
And especially if the patient is of frail constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old person, because the animal spirit is often dissolved by the discharge of pus, and the patient dies easily, and you should be careful with your treatment.
Observe great caution in this chapter, and when making your incision into these abscesses, you should cleanse the wounds and consider whether the abscess wound is small, or a flat incision. If so, apply lint or old cloth. But if the abscess is large and the openings of the incision are many, you should place medicaments in each hole until they meet.
If in the abscess a portion of the skin has been incised or has been hollowed out around it, then you should fill it with old cloth or thread made of linen, like when you have removed bread or roots, without moisture.  And bind that tightly until the third day. Then proceed with treatment and heal it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
But if you encounter a blood flow during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar on a linen cloth, and place that over the site of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment and remedies, using the powders described in many places in this book and in related sections.
But if it is wintertime, and the site of the abscess is a region with many nerves, then you must infuse powders in warm wine and oil, and apply those to the affected areas.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must apply powders soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, and all of this should be cool until the third day, as we have said. Then you must drain the abscess, cleanse it, and provide appropriate treatment until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general; however, according to the method of distinguishing that I have already described, the treatment of each type of abscess is detailed in specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the incision of abscesses that appear on the scalp.
Small abscesses appear on the scalp, and they are a type of swelling containing membranes that are formed around them; and their variety is quite significant.
And some contain pus, and from that comes a moisture resembling lime. And some contain a moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and some are like stones, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as extracting them does not cause any counter-reaction or harm.
And the surgical procedure for incising them is that you probe them with an instrument shaped like this, called an *entromes*, until you know what they contain.
If what it contains is moisture, then you cut it with an incision along the length, by a superficial incision, like this:
And begin the incision on line B up to line G.  Then, once the moisture is evacuated, you scrape off the skin containing that moisture, and leave absolutely nothing of it, for it often returns if any remains.
And then soak a cloth in Egyptian unguent, if available, and otherwise in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it for another day, because this will corrode any remaining skin fragments.
And then repeat applying the Egyptian unguent to that cloth a second and a third time if needed, until you are confident that no remnants of that skin remain; then treat the wound with unguent until healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you incise it in this way: with an incision shaped like a cross, and insert hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your strength in removing the membrane that contains it.
But if your effort encounters resistance, then do what I have told you first.
And similarly, do in the calcified abscess the incision and treatment as we have described; and incision on a calcified abscess is easier, because it is of little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses that are on the head in some men lack moisture; the reason for this is that I incised an abscess on the head of an elderly woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if someone were to be struck with that, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses on the head, this is not the case, like those abscesses that arise near the roots of the ears in children, but the incision of all these should be superficial.
And make the perforation in those from the lower part, so that the body is relieved of the blood in the lower parts.
And then treat them with what is suitable for their treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas which occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they appear in other parts of the body.
And those that appear on the neck, and many are generated among them, and every scrofula of them is within its own tunic, and thus, like the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for among them are some that are like stones, and some that contain moisture, and some are malignant, which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in the one that you find well-disposed upon touch, of which the apparent color is similar to that of a stone, and it is soft in every part, and is not connected to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, along a line from G to B, and drain it thoroughly, and spread the edges of the stone with forceps, or with several forceps if necessary, as we said in the case of head abscesses, and extract that little by little.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve is not cut.
And if the pustule is not very sharp, do not press on it with your incision, or disturb the patient, and do not cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you should cut a vein or artery and thus hinder your operation, then apply crushed vitriol or other powders that stop bleeding, and compress the area, and leave it until the severity of the abscess subsides and the affected area softens and begins to decompose. When the blood is drawn.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then examine with your index finger if there is any other cause of the small scrofulas, then cut them open and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrophula, then you should not cut that scrophula from its roots. Before that, you should tie it with a doubled piece of strong thread and let it be until it falls off by itself without harm.
And then fill the wound with old cotton, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scrophula, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them up as soon as there is no more excess fluid.
But if you see that there is excess fluid due to the size of the scrophula, then you must proceed to cut the root of it, and drain it, and administer sutures and what has been said [in the previous instructions].
And for those scrofulas containing moisture, pierce it with a superficial incision where you see the area of its maturation, and place a drainage incision [or "perforation"] in the area of the pus located lower on the body, as we have said.
And then apply a perforation, some with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes whatever remains of the corruption. And when you see the wound is already cleansed, then you heal it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the boil of an abscess that has happened inside the throat.
The ancients said this incision of the boil, and no one in our land has seen anyone do it.
And this is the writing of their sermon.
But in those with back pain, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, as it will not be beneficial, because all the veins and major organs of the patient are located there.
But in those who have hot abscesses in the mouth or throat or ears, when the illness is not in the throat, the incision of the boil should be used to avoid the loss that is caused by burning.
Therefore, when we want this, we must cut the boil below three circles of the boil's circles, or four with a small incision along the width in the one between two circles, so that the incision is made in a wedge shape, not on the cartilage.  This area is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is fearful, he should then extend the throat's abscess with a hook, and then cut the abscess until he reaches the canal, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any reason for doing so.
And then he should cut the wedge-shaped section, as we have described; and the incision of the canal is indicated by the pus that comes out with what is broken off from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then, once the time for perforation has passed, bring together the two edges of the wound's abscess, and stitch them together without including the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the treatment we have described is not complete unless you see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's airway, and the patient is close to death, and the patient's throat is cut off, and some will cut the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the wound area for some breathing, and thus be saved from death.
And therefore, I command that the wound be left open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then, I command that the wound be closed and treated until it is healed.
And what I myself have seen is that a servant took a knife and placed it in her throat and cut a part of the windpipe, and I was called to treat her, and I found the wound as if it were a wound of the dying, and I uncovered the wound and found little blood that had come from the wound.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming from the wound, and I treated her until she was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant if she did not have a voice problem, and after some days she returned to her former condition.
And now I say that there is no fear in the section of the epilepsy.
Chapter XLIV.
Of incision on an abscess that occurs in the throat, outside, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body, and it is common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural [case], there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental [case] is in two ways, of which one is similar to fatty tumors, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by an artery blockage, and in that case there is fear (of complications). And it is not appropriate to treat it with iron (presumably, cauterization or surgical intervention) except in the case of a small one. And you should test and investigate it with the probe (to determine the nature of the condition). If you find it similar to a fatty tumor and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should cut it out like a tumor, removing it with whatever is contained within its skin and bursa; but if not, then the entire nature of it must be explored, and then the area should be treated with whatever is necessary for healing until it is cured.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount the difference between a tumor and an abscess, as there might be doubt.
Therefore, I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the boiling of the excess is quelled; and complete putrefaction occurs, at which time the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a tumor there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it resembles that lion's paw which is on the proper sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a seed, and it is made thus, like a vessel, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for either it is fatty and contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the cure for a tumor, you should examine it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument called a probe, as its form will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
And it is a way of investigating abscesses and all tumors, and it is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most moist place you find in the abscess, and you will turn your fingers with that little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then, finally, place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then extract the probe and consider what has come out on the trace of it.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you dissect it with a superficial incision as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if from the trace of the probe there is no moisture, then know that it is fat.
And dry it with an incision having the shape of a cross, in this manner: As I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and carefully scrape the pus from all sides, and if possible, save the skin or sac over it and remove the matter with a knot.
However, if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to remove all the matter, and often this happens, and then you remove it in pieces until nothing remains.
For if any part, little or much, remains, the knot will return to the affected area.
And if you see any small part remaining, then fill the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders, and compress the wound, and place a warm poultice over it, and treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large knot, then you sew the two edges together and treat it with something that promotes healing.
But if there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein nearby, then you cut and fill the area with crushed vitriol (green vitriol), and leave it in place for two or three days until the wound subsides and the blood's inflammation quiets down; and then return to dissecting out what remains of the knot.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary for incision and perforation.
Of those (instruments) which are of three types, some are large, some are of medium size, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
Let them be made of iron, or bronze, with sharpened extremities, so that they may penetrate the abscesses easily.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and are called probes, and one of them is called a lancet.
And there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large instrument, its form:
The form of the medium instrument, its form:
The form of the small instrument, its form:
It is fitting that they be used for those abscesses, boils, fistulas, and buboes, so that between them are the bones and other things.
And they are made round, thick, sharp, like large needles with which saddles are stitched, and are made of citrus wood, or of horn or iron or silver.  And the best are when they are made of citrus wood.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are believed to open fistulas in whose cavity are reflections, that they are reflected by their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the amount of the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many kinds, for some of them are simple, having only one curve, and these are of three kinds: large, small, and medium.
And of them are also hooks without teeth, and these are of three kinds.
And of those are hooks with two curves, and these are of three kinds.
And of them are also those with three curves, and these are of three kinds.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small, simple hook, its form:
Form of a large hook with two curves: Form of a medium-sized hook with two curves: Form of a small hook with two curves:
Form of a large hook with three curves:
Form of a medium-sized hook with three curves:
And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and they are of three kinds, for of those there is a large, medium, and small one.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of the medium-sized scalpel:
Form of the small scalpel:
The ends with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are blunt, and they are not placed in such a manner, but so that the removal of the nodes is done gently, to avoid the cutting of a vein or nerve.  This heals the patient and brings some peace by the burning sensation felt at the incision of the abscess.
And these are the forms of lancets, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron, and are similar in shape to a reed with which one makes alcohol.
And it has a pointed tip concealed by a sheath, and in that sheath, it has parts inside and outside, so you can use it as you see fit.
The forms of lancets, which are hidden among the fingers to pierce abscesses without the patients perceiving them, come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The forms of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is drawn, are of three sizes; large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They are made from citrus wood, round with some length, and are thin.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be available to you, so that through them the flow of blood can be drawn quickly when needed, and this is the primary medicine in those cases.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, breasts, belly, and knees, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments like thin skins of bladders are made in this fashion; with which blood is drawn when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the treatment of male breasts that resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep, as they begin to become hairy, and then the breasts swell, resembling women's breasts, and become inflamed, painful.
And whoever sees this, should cut those with a lunar incision in this shape, from line B to line G, and then scrape off all the swelling, then fill the wound with a flesh-healing medicine, and then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and treat it until healed.
But if the breast inclines downwards and is softened by its size as it should be in women, then it should be split into two equal halves with two incisions similar to a lunar shape, each contained within the other at the end of each, until the larger line contains the smaller one following this shape, from line B and line G. Then scrape off the swelling which is between the two edges of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about stitching and powders, what is necessary in the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision needed to cut because of the patient's discomfort and blood flow, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment and leave it until it has corroded away the remaining fat, and then treat it until healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the lancing of abscesses that arise beneath the skin.
These abscesses that arise beneath the skin are a type of scrofulous, hard swelling, which contains a pouch-like skin.
And of these, some contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut along this line: from line G to line B.  And when everything that is in the abscess, of the pus, is emptied, then you should fill it with old cloth and leave it until the next day.
Then the cloth should be removed and treated with an appropriate ointment until healed.
And if the abscess is of the nature of nodes or scrofulas, then you should incise it similarly as we have described in the section on scrofulas as well.
And if the ulcer spreads so that it might break open, then administer a cautery to it, as we previously described in that regard.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses caused by arrow wounds or by vein damage.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the sheath surrounding it is consolidated, often an abscess arises.  And the signs by which one knows that inflammation and abscess are caused by an artery or a vein are: for when an abscess is from an arrow wound, it is long and aggravated in the direction of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a whistling sound.
And the one caused by a vein is round and evident on the body's surface.
And incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in those located under the armpits, in the elbows, in the neck, and many other places on the body; and it is very serious, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that on the extremities, or head, should be avoided.
But on those caused by inflammation of the arrow's opening, make an incision along the sheath; and then widen the incision with hooks and pull out the arrow, and free it from the tissues until it is exposed.
And then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and pull the arrow with a double thread at two points—which I teach you in the extraction of two arrows, which are in the Templars.
And then prick the area between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment in which pus is generated until the ligaments fall; and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess from a vein's incision, then you should hold with your hand the part of the abscess nearest the sheath, and then insert the needle below the area you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and have a double thread there until you extract it from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a bandage, as I have shown you in the ligament of a grape with two parts and two ends of the thread.
But if you fear pulling out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle beneath the entire abscess, below the incision of the first needle, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until what is inside it comes out; then cut the excess of the sheath, and leave what is bound to it.
And then place on it a poultice soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that arises from a twisting of the nerves.
Thus, as abscesses arise in the arteries and veins, similarly abscesses arise in the nerves when they are injured by percussion or excessive strain, and by similar causes.
And it is most common in the places of the ligaments or the heel, or in any location where the joints are strained.
And it is a serious abscess, and is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is in the worst of positions, without their own, and when it is tight with vehemence, the patient feels a kind of stupor.
And it is not an abscess gathered in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the rib cage, and it is painful all around, and it does not extend to the front or back parts.
Therefore, for those that are in the joints, it should not be opened with iron, for it will very easily cause contraction.
But that which is on the head or forehead, lance with a lance (spatum). But if it is a small abscess, then cut it out with forceps and excise it from the roots.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with hooks, and scrape it, and then remove it; and stitch the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Of the incision of an abscess that arises from a boil that arises in the belly.
Many times, in the bellies of some people and other parts of their bodies, there are boils that are called "fungal" due to their resemblance to fungi, whose roots are subtle and the head is large; and the lips of these are often folded, and some are small, and some are quite large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly there were two boils that were more like fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with small roots.
And their lips were inverted and split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
Therefore, I incised them and found one weighing eighteen ounces and the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you should consider if the patient is moist, and the boil's color is white, moist, with subtle roots; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries ready in the fire, because often a lot of blood is expelled during the incision; and if you see blood coming out, cauterize that area.
And if the patient is weak and fearful, beware of incising with iron; but then take fresh lead plaster and compress the boil with it, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead bandage; therefore, do not cease compressing the lead bandage firmly on the boil, until it is separated and falls off on its own without effort.
But if the boil has thick roots, then its incision causes some fear and apprehension, especially if it is in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize that area so it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a boil that is dark in color, has little feeling, and is hard to discern, for such a boil is cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to do this.
Chapter 52.
Of the treatment of a swelling at the navel.
A swelling at the navel is caused by various things; either by ruptures in the tissue over the belly, where part of the bowel or intestine is protruding, like other hernias; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as mentioned before; or by trapped air or gas in that location.
However, if it's due to a rupture in the abdominal wall and protrusion of the tissue, then the color of the abscess will resemble the color of the body; and it is painless, and appears in various locations. And if it's due to the intestine protruding, then its location is different from what we have described, with more diverse symptoms, and when you press on it with your fingers, it is hidden and then returns; and it's very close to the opening of the abdomen, and greatly swollen and very painful.
But if it's due to moisture, then it's painless, and it is not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor swollen.
And if it's due to blood, then the abscess appears with a darkening, blackish coloration.
But if it's due to dead flesh, then the abscess is severe, large, and hard, and is fixed in a specific area.
But if it's due to wind (gas), then the touch of it is painless.
And the treatment for it is to consider whether the swelling near the navel is from an arrow wound, a vein injury, or wind/gas; then you should avoid treating it, because there is fear and dread in such cases, as has been taught in the chapter where I discussed abscesses from arrow wounds and vein injuries.
And if the swelling near the navel is due to the intestine or the mesentery, then you should tell the patient to hold their breath and lie stretched out.  Then, gently probe the area around the entire navel with a probe.  Then, have them face between your hands on their back and carefully use a blunt instrument to circle the area around the navel where you marked with the probe.  Then, carefully cut away half of the abscess at the top portions with a large scalpel.  Then, tie the area around the perimeter with strong thread or linen and tie in a proper, well-constructed manner.
Then, cut open the middle of the enlarged abscess over the ligament and insert your finger into that opening and search for the intestine.  And if you have found or identified the intestine within the ligament, then you gently extract and push the intestine back into the abdominal cavity.
And if you have found the mesentery, then take hold of it with a scalpel and cut away the excess.
However, if it is an arrow wound or vein injury, then encircle that area and then return to your procedure.  Take two needles and thread strong thread through them, and insert the needles into the circle you created around the abscess in a cross pattern, pushing them in. Then, compress the abscess into four sections over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the swollen flesh subsides and falls away on its own; or, cut it open when it is softened and begins to yield, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling at the navel is caused by flesh growing there or by moisture, then it is necessary to drain the abscess as we have described and remove the blood or moisture you find there, and then treat it with what is appropriate to consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of cancer and how it is treated with medicine, and that cauterization with iron is harmful because it does not heal the ulcer; and we have discussed cancer originating in the breast and the precautions to take in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to remove it, such as cancer in the nipples or the thigh, and similar growths on other body parts, especially when it is small and newly formed.
But when it is old and large, it is not advisable to treat it directly, for I have not been able to cure any such case, nor have I seen anyone who has, nor has anyone succeeded in doing so.
And the operation on it, when located as we have said, is that you should proceed by making the patient vomit and purge black bile sometimes, and then bleed them, if a clear accumulation is found.
And then prepare the patient with the preparation appropriate to the location of the operation, and then insert hooks into the wound as required; and then, using a suitable sharp instrument, excavate thoroughly from all sides until no trace of the roots remains. And allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it lightly, and squeeze the area, and clean away the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instrument you have available.
However, if you encounter difficulty with thick blood from a vein or artery incision, then cauterize it until the flow of blood stops, and then treat it with the other methods until it is healed.
Chapter 154.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy caused by water, and the symptoms of each type, as well as the treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of [a disease affecting the]  upper part of the body [or a certain type of swelling], and it is not appropriate to use iron on the type of tympanites [abdominal distension] or the type of hypospargia [a type of fluid collection, perhaps in the scrotum/groin], for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanites dropsy with medicines, and your treatment does not show improvement, then consider, if the patient is already weakened, or has another illness, or another type of dropsy, such as if it is in their chest or abdomen and similar conditions, then be careful not to treat it with iron, for fear of harm.
However, if you see the patient's vitality is strong, and it's only dropsy and not another illness, and the patient is neither a child nor an elderly person, then the method for treating them is to lift the patient between your hands, and have an assistant press on the patient's abdomen with their hand, pushing the water towards the lower part of the chest, and then take a spiny swab in this manner:
It should be two parts long, pointed at one end like a swab; however, there should be some slight shortness to it, so that in the procedure you do not pass it into the intestine and injure it.
And then consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for if so, you must, with the incision, move away from the navel by about three fingers towards the lower parts, on the right side above the chest.
But if the dropsy is caused by liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And your incision should not be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, for fear of the superfluities flowing to that constricted place.
And then pierce the entire membrane with the instrument, and insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the sac, and you scrape it; and if the amount is a fingernail or about.
And then pierce the sac until the spatula reaches the empty space, and it is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles a thin silver cannula; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on the lower part of which there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is cut in the manner of a feather, just as you see:
And on its highest point is a little arm or flange, because when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately falls over the instrument, therefore evacuating a moderate amount of the water, for if you evacuate more than necessary at that time, the patient will quickly die by resolution of their vital spirit, or it brings on the signs of impending death.
However, evacuate it according to the quantity indicated by the instrument's effect and according to the patient's condition, the strength of their pulse, and their overall well-being.
And then remove the instrument, and retain the water, which is why it is immediately retained by the valve that covers the hole in the [device/part].  And I have told you to pierce it in this manner.
Then repeat the procedure on another day if the patient tolerates it, and remove a small amount of water.  Do this for several days with caution, and avoid mistakes until little water remains.
However, if you fear for the patient's health and leave a large amount of water, then cure it with burial in hot sand, and induce perspiration through bathing, and exposure to the sun for a long time.  And cure it with drying remedies until it is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen, and liver after the water extraction, as I have described in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children born in places where the urinary tract is not perforated.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urinary tract is not perforated (or is a narrow opening or is not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with a perforation as soon as it is born with a very fine instrument, following this method:
And then place a thin lead peg in the opening, and bind it, and keep it in place for three days or four.
And when it wants to urinate, let it urinate; and then return it [the peg].
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow this opening to close.
But that which has a narrow opening should be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for several days until it widens.
But those in whom the opening is not in its place, as mentioned, and the cause of this is that, for example, the opening is near the end of the penis' head so that it cannot urinate properly, then raise the penis with your hand upwards; and this is not due to a problem of generation, because the semen cannot reach the mother correctly, and is a very slow illness.
And the method of the operation in this case is that the patient be placed on their back, and then gently pull the head of their penis with your left hand, and cut the tip of the penis' head from the area of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, like the incision of a pen, or to scrape off some part, so that the middle of it comes to resemble the head of the penis and that the opening falls into its proper place, as necessary.
And be careful that during your surgical procedure, blood flow often happens; and stop it using something to staunch the blood, and heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of the hardening that occurs in the foreskin on the head of the penis, and of the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
Many times this hardening occurs on the penis, and it is a protuberance of loose flesh.
And of that one is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine thread and cut it off until it all comes away; then place a bit of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment on that area; and then, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the hardening is malignant, of a livid color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and its roots.
But if the hardening is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the hardening is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the hardening that is inside first until it is healed; and then you treat the exterior part, for when you treat them both at the same time with the foreskin, it is not guaranteed that it will not be torn.
And if you see darkening and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you should remove all that which is already blackened and is about to corrupt or is already corrupt; and then apply a line over it with honey mixed with ground pomegranate bark and crushed and sieved herbs.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
because a helpful cautery is for two conditions together, that is, for a flow of blood and for the plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is eroded and completely destroyed at once, then you should insert a lead cannula into the foreskin's opening so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a plague or an abscess), you must scrape with a blunt spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed completely.
And if it is difficult to discern them precisely, then you should scrape off any cause of adhesion between the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when thin, is easily pierced by its own thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with thin linen cloths, which have already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
And then it should be treated with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
Chapter 57.
Of the purification of children and the treatment of what occurs in those undergoing circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is our procedure and of our volition, and its purpose is primarily in children, it is necessary to focus on the best procedure and easiest path to recovery.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not discuss circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws. It is only because we have acquired it through experience that I have found the majority of craftsmen and barbers using circumcision and purification with a razor and with torches; and they use a ligature with thread and an incision with a fingernail.
And I have already tried all these methods and have found no better purification with scissors, with a thread ligature, than with purification with a fingernail, because many times the foreskin comes off too quickly, as the foreskin has two layers, and the deeper layer remains, and it is easily forced to further incision and a more certain pain. And with purification that is performed with a knife, and is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secure, for it easily enters the opening.
But in the procedure with a fingernail, it is very easy to damage the iron and spoil your work. And the foreskin of the child is short by nature, and many times they are born in such a way that it does not require purification, and I have seen that.
But the purification done with scissors and a thread ligature, its goodness, experience has shown me, because the scissors are for a proportional incision, because the sharpness on top is as sharp as the sharpness below; and thus when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and you can cut it according to a comparison in a moment; and the compression of the thread, in a form containing the foreskin of the penis on all sides, prevents any error altogether.
And the first method of the operation is that you should have the child mostly if it is one that understands a little, and you should simply tie the thread around its penis and leave it until the next day.
And then do that joyfully in whatever way possible for that which receives its intelligence. And then place that between your hands, firmly prepared, and let there be no hesitation; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child does not see them or any other instrument.
And then put your hand on the penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then clean it of any dirt clinging to it.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt and the other sharp, so the blade doesn't come out of the handle, and the length of both blades should be the same as the length of two handles together.
But the error in cleaning is that you forcefully remove the foreskin completely, or part of it, from the incision.
Therefore, you must extend that with your fingertip before the abscess is incised and make the incision along the line of equal length.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingertip, then pull it out with tweezers and make the incision.
But if three days have passed and that which is inflamed beneath the penis remains an abscess, then you leave it until the hot abscess has subsided, and easily scrape it away, and then make the incision as you have prepared.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not help him.
And then cure it with what consolidates wounds from the powders that we have described in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised from the tendon excessively and you make incisions on the surrounding areas, that will not benefit him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction created by a stone or by congealed blood, or by pus or by coagulated matter, and similar to those things that we have discussed about the methods of treatment in the previous division/section.
And if the urine is not released by what we have discussed, and a powerful cause is at work on the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction of it with an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the form: It should be of silver and have a subtle, conical shape, like a bird's feather quill, with subtle, long, ray-like protrusions resembling a palm and a half, at the tip of which should be a narrow tube.
And the way of extracting the urine with this is that you should take a folded linen cloth or cotton and tie it to the end of it; and introduce the ends of the cloth into the area below the syringe, and cut away any excess cloth with scissors, but introduce it firmly into the tube with force.  Then you should lubricate the syringe with butter and egg white.
And place the patient on a pillow, and lubricate the bladder and urethra with moist oils, and olive oil and water.
Then introduce the syringe gently until it reaches the root of the urethra; then pull the urethra upwards towards the navel area; then push the syringe into that; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder, and that indicates the patient's condition has reached the void, and this is not done in this order, but the path is tortuous.
Then pull out the cloth with the wool little by little, for the urine will dry the cloth.
Then remove it and use the urine for treatment; use the syringe, do not stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 9.
Of the quality of bladder irrigation with a clamp and similar instruments suitable for that purpose.
When the bladder has an ulceration or abscess, or congealed blood within it, or its opening is constricted, and you wish to instill liquids and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a clamp-like device, and this is its form:
but rather than having an opening, it is closed, or sealed at the end. And on that (closed end) there are three openings; two on one side, and thus two openings.
At the beginning is a concave space, in which is what is to be expelled, and it should be according to the quantity that obstructs it, without additional force, so that when some cause draws the humors out, it is drawn out, and when it is expelled, that draws along with it, and when it is expelled far, as does the clamp-like device with which naphtha is used in naval battles.
Therefore, when you wish to inject liquids into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp-like device into the liquid, and pull out what is being pushed towards the upper parts, for the liquid is drawn into the concavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp-like device into the urethra, as we have described in the treatise; and then push the liquid with what you are pushing, for that liquid will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will feel relief.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is cauterized, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or lead, of which the upper head should resemble a small plume, and below it a narrow channel within it.
Then take a bladder, and place in it the liquid you want to cauterize in the bladder, and then tie it between two things with a strong double-threaded bandage, and heat that liquid over the fire.
Then insert the tip of the cautery into the urethra.
Then press your hand firmly on the bladder containing the liquid until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; and perforate it all the way through; and then insert strong thread into those holes, turning it as you go; and then attach the circle as it is attached to a frame, so that you can place in it the liquids, oils, and waters you wish to treat.
And then you tie that to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, and press with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed the stones in which manual operation and incision are necessary.
And the stone formed in the bladder is properly that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder primarily affect children; and among the signs of it is that the urine expelled from the bladder is like water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs their penis, frequently groans, and the penis is often erected; and with this they strain their anus in many of them.
And the cure is easier in children than those who have reached fourteen years of age; and it is a difficult cure in the elderly. But in young people it is easier because it is among them (or: it is common among them).
And for that in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning to clean the patient with a clyster that removes all the inflammation in their bowels; for this inflammation sometimes hinders the expulsion of the stone from its place.
And then the patient should be placed with their feet elevated and gently beaten/massaged below so that the stone descends to the bladder, or that it jumps out of its place, or sometimes.
And then, position the patient with their hands placed beneath their thighs, so that the entire bladder is positioned downward.
And then, remove that (the stone) and all the rest from outside (the body).
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you immediately apply a cut (incision) on it.
And if it doesn't completely descend with your touch, then you must oil your index finger (of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if they are a grown adult) and insert it into their rectum. And remove the stone until it is below your finger. And gently push it (the stone) little by little towards the bladder neck.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outside the area where you made the incision.
And tell the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and tell another assistant to, with their right hand, pull the genitals upwards, and with their left hand, hold the groin area, the part below the genitals, near the place where the incision is made.
And then insert the spatula properly, which is shaped like this: And cut through the area between the buttocks and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be made on that stone, and your finger be in the buttocks, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the incision outside is wide and inside narrow according to the amount that the stone protrudes, as possible, and not more, for if you press too hard with your finger in the buttocks on the stone near the incision, it will be forcefully expelled without difficulty.
And know that there is some stone with angles and edges, which makes its expulsion difficult because of that.
And that one, which is like a nut, round, is easily expelled.
Therefore, if it is the one with angles and edges, adjust it into the fissure.
And if it is not expelled this way, then you must carefully manipulate it, or gently press it with a tool, the end of which is like a file that you press against the stone, and do not remove it from the area; or gently insert a curved, slender instrument underneath it.
But if you cannot do that, then enlarge the opening slightly, and if you see blood flow, staunch it by pressing with powdered vitriol.
But if the stones are more than one, then at the beginning, you press your hand against the opening of the bladder, and then cut into it; and then gently press further into it; and do the same if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is foolish to cut it with a large incision, because you cause the patient one of two things: either death or the constant leakage of urine, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer an expulsion process until it is expelled, or manipulate its fracture with forceps until you break it into pieces.
Therefore, once you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and press it down. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in warmed oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be soothed.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have loosened that, bathe the area with water and warm oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound a hot, burning, and corrosive abscess appears, and it resembles the blood in the bladder being congealed, and because of it, urination is obstructed (and this is known by the blood coming out with the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will cause corruption of the bladder and eventually putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with whatever else is appropriate for its treatment, until it is healed.
And during all the treatment, you must bind both thighs and adjust the medicines that have been placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, and is embedded there, and urination is also obstructed, then treat it with what I recommended before, so as to avoid cutting into it, for often this treatment is mistaken for cutting; and I have proven this, and so you should take a sharpened iron drill, of which this is the shape:
with a triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take a bandage, and bind the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing it easily until the drill reaches that stone. And rotate the drill with your hand on that small stone little by little, and you widen the hole until you make the other end penetrate; for the urine will be released immediately.
And then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, for that is fractured, and it has been forced out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
However, if this cure is not suitable for you for any reason that prohibits it, then tie a bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then cauterize the stone on that penis between the two bandages. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and clean the congealed blood, which has formed on the wound.
And a bandage below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and the other bandage above it is only necessary to prevent the expulsion of the stone, because when the bandage below the stone is loosened, the stone returns to its place and heals the wound.
And therefore, when you tie the bandage above, it is necessary for you to lift the stone upwards, or it will return towards your hand, and thus heal the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Concerning the extraction of stones from women.
Stones are rarely formed in women.
However, if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and there are many different methods.
One of them is if the woman is very young/virginal.
And the second is that you do not find a woman well-informed who reveals herself to a physician when she is chaste, or is one of the married women.
The third is that you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the surgical procedure with hands.
And the fourth is that the place of the incision on a stone in women is far from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and in that is danger/fear.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a knowledgeable female physician, and few are found.
However, if you are deprived of that, then seek a skillful and subtle male physician, or present a skilled female matron experienced in women's matters, or a woman proficient in this art.
Therefore, present her, and instruct her to do everything you command her, concerning the examination for the stone at the beginning; which is done to see if the woman is a virgin,  then she must insert her finger into the woman's vagina and feel for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she should press down on it with her finger, and then instruct her to make an incision on that spot.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it gently.
If it is found, then she must gently extract it from the opening of the bladder towards the lower parts, using the full force of her strength until it reaches the base of the thigh.
And then make an incision near the midpoint of the vagina, towards the base of the thigh, wherever the stone is located.  Hold the stone in that place, and keep the finger pressed on the stone, firmly underneath.
And the incision should be small at first; then insert the instrument into the incision, and if the stone is felt, enlarge the incision according to the size needed to ensure the stone is ejected from the area.
And know that the types of stones are many: some are small and large, some sharp and rough, and some long and round, and some having ridges.
Therefore, you should know how many types there are of [stones/things], so that you can refer to what you desire to speak of.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply powdered vitriol to the area and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your procedure until the stone is expelled.
And prepare the instruments necessary for the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your procedure.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the incised artery, then you apply powder to the area and constrict it with bandages and a tightening descent, and do not repeat this; let the stone be and do not remove it, for the patient will likely die. And then treat the wound.
So, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area heals, then you return to your procedure until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of incision on a strangulated hernia.
An acute hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which is beneath the groin's sheath containing the testicle, and is called the scrotum.
And sometimes it is in the proper pouch that nature prepared in the region of the testicle, until it is cared for as there is another testicle; and it is the groin's sheath between the white scrotum that we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a delay.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that affects the testicles, so that this matter is released into them, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours, for its colour is either leaning towards citron or bloody, or red, or black and slimy, or watery and white, and that is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this collection of water is are these: if it is in the white scrotum we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, sloping slightly lengthwise like an egg shape, and the testicle is visible, because the moisture surrounds that on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper pouch, then the swelling is round with a part resembling a testicle, and thus one mistakenly believes it is another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the folds of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it lies lower on the groin.
And if you want to know the colour of the moisture, then you probe the colour of the moisture in the swelling with a thin, pointed instrument, whose shape precedes it.  And according to what appears on the trace of the instrument, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, it is necessary to order the patient to be bled, if possible, and to empty the patient's body.
And afterward, place him on his back on a slightly elevated surface, and put several cloths underneath him.
Then sit on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right, who should stretch his staff to one of two places: at the fold of the testicles and at the groin/lower abdomen area.
And then, take a sharp blade and divide the groin crease along its length, roughly towards the pubic area.
And the incision should be made along a straight line, equidistant from the line you should follow on the skin of the groin, until it reaches the visible white tissue.
And scrape away that [tissue], observe, and be careful not to cut into it; and your scraping, with which you scrape it away, should be done gently and subtly, as precisely as possible.
And then pierce the water-filled sac with a wide opening, and extract all the water.
And then, separate the two edges of the incision with forceps, and extend the sac outwards;  do not touch the groin crease, and cut the sac in whatever way is possible for you. And cut it [the sac] entirely or in pieces, and especially its subtle layers, for if you do not carefully examine the incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the sac protrudes from its cavity during your operation, then once you have completed the sac incision, return it inside, and then rejoin the edges of the groin crease with stitches, and then treat it just like other wounds until it heals.
And if you find the sac corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie off the vessels that support it, remove the sac, and then treat it as we have described.
But if the water is collected in two distinct places, for example, know that there are two hernias; therefore, cut that part as you did the other one; and if it seems to you to be one operation, then do it.
And then you clean the blood, and apply wool soaked in oil or clarified oil to the incisions; and put another wool soaked in wine and oil over that, and spread that over the groin and the abdominal wound; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and bandage it together in this manner:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with wool prepared in this way; and make the ends with which they are pressed with cotton or damp wool, and attach them with a tight band to the undergarments, one end goes from the buttocks to the groin, and the second goes to the area of the thigh, and two ends over the thighs below, and two other ends over the knees, and all the bandages should be fastened to the undergarments.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of cutting with iron; and you should take a sharp, small knife cautery and with it cut the skin of the groin, and cauterize as we have described until the white membrane containing the water is exposed, and then you take a cautery in this shape: and it is shaped like a Greek letter.
And then pierce through that membrane, and cauterize until all the moisture is expelled.
Then pull the membrane open with forceps, and scrape off the membrane with a heated, sharp cautery; and cut it as much as you can until you eliminate it all; and be careful that the heat doesn't burn the egg sac (testicles/ovary).
And know that this operation is safer and less likely to cause bleeding, and better than an operation with cutting.
However, if you encounter an abscess during the incision or cauterization, or bleeding, then you must treat any complications that arise from this, with a treatment that is appropriate to the situation.
But if the patient is weak and cannot tolerate a second operation due to its severity, then perform the perforation as I have described; and it is when, based on what we have said about the signs, you are certain that the hernia is acute.
Then you should have the patient sit on a raised surface, then pierce the abscess in the lowest part of it with a narrow, flat instrument, and direct the perforation along the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough that all the fluid drains out.
And then place a cloth over the area, bind it, and leave it, so that the remaining fluid drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the fluid draining, then you pierce it: and this is done because a white film in the opening of the wound creates resistance and prevents the fluid from escaping.  In that case, you should insert a reed or instrument used to draw water from hydrops, the form of which is previously described, or apply gentle pressure to the wound.
And know that the fluid returns, and is retained for approximately six months or thereabouts; and when it is retained, then it should be pierced again in the same way, so that the patient will pass through their days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this fleshy hernia, there is fear of harm in the most serious cases; therefore, I have seen its dismissal and survival by this better method.
And I am recalling the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the parts where the humors are collected, and this is done for many reasons: either because of a sharp, severe excess of humor which is discharged into the parts, or because of a blow.
And the color of the abscess corresponds to the color of the affected part, and if there is no pain felt there, it is a serious abscess.
And a hard, stony abscess is a serious one, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in the area.
And sometimes it is caused by the obstruction of arteries, and by the inflammation of those, just as is perceived in the recollection of it, or by the inflammation of veins.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the arteries is recognized by the dispersal of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and it is not appropriate that you touch it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means from pressing with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision be made on this type and on other flesh; and you should incise the skin of the genitals, and then spread the scrotum outward, and extract that from the white sac, and release the suspensory ligaments, and tie them, and cut the suspensory ligament further once you release it from all the parts of the scrotum.
Therefore, if the scrotum is already with those flesh-like tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the scrotum and cut it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the sac, or between the vessels, then it is necessary that you release all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the area of the adhesion that is behind, then it is necessary that you cut all of that away, and extract the scrotum just as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in warmed oil and wine; and then treat it with further care until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of a hernia that is incarcerated.
An incarcerated hernia is a swollen abscess, encased in something like a swelling with softening of the testicles, making difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the patient.
And in treating this illness, fear is to be considered, given what has preceded.
However, one must perform the operation as soon as possible.
And I say that you must place the patient on a raised surface; then pull the support of the testicles downwards; then hold the base of the genitals with your fingers and the bandages around the penis;  and let another assistant do the same, and extend them with strong pulling force.
Then, with a sharp, wide scalpel, make a transverse incision along the course of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then, scrape away everything as we have described in the extraction of arrows, which are in the temples.
Then, insert a needle with a double thread into those places where you have incised; tie it to the front of those places where you have incised, and then tie it again to the back of them. Then, cut those in the middle, lengthwise, along the body's length, and extract the accumulated foul and corrupted humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment for other wounds where you want pus to be generated, so that the vessels that nourished one or the other of the two genitals may collapse, for that is no harm.
However, if you have incised all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed, or that the testicles be cut off along with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be dried up, or that they are cut off so that there is no nourishment by them.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a cut that extends on the belly from the groin area of the abdominal region, causing the intestines to emerge from that rupture into some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either from the groin or from a straining of it, and these two types occur for many reasons: either by a blow, or by a jump, or by shouting, or by lifting something heavy, or by similar actions.
And the sign of this, when it is due to a straining of the groin, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it forms a swelling near the groin because the groin constricts the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is due to a cut in the groin, is that at the beginning it causes sudden and intense pain; and there is a diverse swelling appearing below the groin area close to the surface, and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and the body of it is in parts outside the groin.
And sometimes the intestine and the membrane are expelled, and this is called an intestinal hernia, or a visceral hernia.
And sometimes it is caused by wind, and sometimes a tear in the intestine occurs, and it is trapped there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it creates severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this illness with iron there is a fear, for which it is necessary to avoid such a treatment in that case.
And the manner of the operation for this is that you command the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the inside of its cavity if you observe its return, and then it should be placed on his chest between your hands, and elevate his legs.
And then stretch the cord which is attached to the testicles upwards, and cut the cord of the testicles entirely lengthwise; and then place two hooks on the sides of the incision, as you would need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the testicle to be expelled.
And then scrape away the tissue that is underneath the cord of the testicles, until the hard white scrotum is exposed on each side.
Then, you insert your finger into the area where the testicle is, between the white scrotum that is below the cord of the testicle, and the other scrotum, and separate the adhesion that is on the back side of the testicle.
Then, hold the cord of the testicles outward with your hand, and with this, lift the white scrotum upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with the scrotum towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle up, and you detach the adhesion that is behind it with a complete solution.
And check with your fingers that there is no cause for the intestine to be wrapped around the hard white scrotum. But if you find any such cause, then you push it back into the abdominal cavity below.
And then make an incision in the area below the testicles, through which blood and pus will flow, just as we have described in what we said earlier.
And then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the bandage we described (and sometimes the scrotum is cauterized, which we mentioned near the incision to prevent bleeding, since sometimes that happens), and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the healing process is delayed, then warm water should be applied and kept there until it falls off, as we said.
And then treat the wound with other remedies for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of the windy hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that should be burned with iron in the treatment.
And the earlier ones said that it is done as we have described in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision over it with ease; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with what opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that is done in the ankles.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the ankles, as we have said, and you should remove the foreign object.
And do not leave any cause of intestines in the groin; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at any time.
However, if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure in the groin is likely, until the intestine descends into the groin; and this happens because of the extension of the groin area, as we have said, which causes the groin to be stretched and softened, and the area becomes suppurated and you remove it.
And the treatment for it is with a cautery, as is preceded by the narration of it.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron, in this manner:  the patient lies on their back with your hands on them, and then the area of the rupture and the suppurations are dried up with incision by the width, according to the quantity of three days.
And then hold the white groin that is under the cod (testicle) until it is uncovered.
And then take the reed and place it on the prominent area of the groin, and press it to the area of the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent areas above the groin's reed-like (elongated) area, and join one of those to the other with stitching.
And then pull out the reed, and do not cut the groin completely, nor extend the testicle, nor anything else, as I have instructed you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment for ulcers, and as you would cut away pus, cleanse it and restore the ulcer until it is healed; for the groin is contracted and the rupture's prominence is not aligned.
And cautery is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of softening the tightness of the testicles.
Often the tightness of the testicles in some men is softened by this, because the flesh between them is softened, and care for them is required.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one attending to the cure to have the patient lie according to their side, and to spread out all the softened tissue that surrounds the natural tightness; and then to bring the two edges together with stitches.
And if you wish, stitch the excess of softened tissue at the beginning with three or four stitches, and with firm stitching.
And then, you should make incisions between the stitches; and then treat with a cure for other wounds until it is healed and the pus subsides.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our law, is forbidden, but for a reason, it is permitted to me to mention it in this book.  Its mention is necessary for two reasons: one, so that the physician, when asked about it, will know how to treat the condition it causes; and the second reason is that we often need to castrate other animals for our own benefit, such as oxen, goats, pigs, and animals similar to these.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by a cut to sever.
However, in the method of castration by crushing, the procedure is to place the animal in hot water until its genitals soften and hang loose. And then grasp them with your hand until they are broken and no longer appear beneath the touch.
But in castration done by cutting and severing, you must hold the animal and press the scrotum with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut into each testicle with a cut until both testicles are severed.
And then cut those [parts] further, once each is scraped/skinned. And do not leave behind any cause from the scrotum, except the subtle membrane that is over the vessels.
And this method of castration, which is done by scraping, is better, because vigorous scraping leaves no cause in the testicles for the animal to desire mating.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when it appears as a space in the scrotum, between the testicles, in the shape of a woman's vulva, containing hair.
And sometimes urine flows from the area in the scrotum between the testicles.
But in women, it is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman, on the pubic area, is like two testicles of a man, slightly enlarged outwardly, in the same way as a man's foreskin and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: for two of the men and one type for women. And it is necessary that you incise those adhering flesh until the pressure subsides, and then treat them with the remedies for other wounds.
And in the second type of men, concerning urine in the scrotum, there is no cure nor operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of swelling and protruding flesh due to women's conditions.
A mild swelling is often caused by natural factors until it subsides and the condition improves; and sometimes it becomes severe in some women to the point of spreading as in men and extending to the area of intercourse.
Then you should remove the excess swelling with your hand or with a scalpel.
And do not over-cut, especially in the area of the root, lest you cause a flow of blood.
And then treat it with remedies for sores until it heals.
However, a fleshy growth that arises within the mother's womb until it fills it, and easily comes out at the openings in the form of a tail (and therefore some early doctors would call this "a tail-like disease"); thus, it must be cut as one cuts swelling, and treated until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
Dropsy is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental dropsy is due to a preceding illness, and this is caused either by flesh that is not properly joined or by a subtle or thick fluid.
And it occurs either in the region of the mother's womb, or in her ribs, or in her upper or lower abdomen, and you forbid cooking, consumption, and childbirth, and strongly forbid menstruation.
And the diagnosis is made by observing the midwife, if the obstruction is apparent, promptly; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your words or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a subtle fluid, and is close to the two lips, then you should cook and break it apart.
And you should place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers on both lips together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then forcefully spread the two lips until that subtle fluid is broken and the obstruction is open.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the affected area, and let the patient rest there for the day so that the incision does not become consolidated.
But if the fluid is thick and dense, then you must cut it with a sharp instrument (perhaps a lancet) or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to a clot, then lift that clot with forceps, and cut it open.
And have with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing bites, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and linseed, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it in place for a few days and apply warm compresses.
And then treat it with another healing treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes, it affects the surrounding tissues, and then it needs to be incised using this method. But if it is due to a boil, a boil located in the head should not be pierced with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids, and of a red swelling that appears in the female's vagina.
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and if the hemorrhoids are long-standing and ulcers have formed.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of those [hemorrhoids] and their signs, and I will now say which ones receive treatment and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and ulcers, when they are deep within the anus and do not appear on the surface, no treatment with iron should be applied.
But those which are on the opening of the anus, where one can feel them, are the ones that can be treated.
And you should place the woman in a cool place and then carefully cut the ulcer with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and remove the roots.
And then sprinkle over them the flow of blood from one of the cutting powders without biting, such as acacia and similar ones.
And then soak their feet for an hour, and then place them in cool water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make the patient sit in a decoction of sumat (likely a plant), and the bark of pomegranates, walnuts, and similar things.
And then take barley flour, mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a poultice with it and place it on their back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two leeches, and to the breasts without incision.
And then take wool, soak it in the juice of coriander or the juice of arnagloza (possibly a similar plant) or the juice of germander mixed with diluted wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the accidental perforation of the breast (or chest).
Many types of abscesses can occur in the breast, such as cancer, stony abscesses, ulcers, boils, creeping sores, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fistulas, and other abscesses. And I have already described these illnesses and their types, their symptoms, and their treatments in the division.
And I must discuss in this treatise the acute abscess that occurs in the breast when it is one of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you wish to know how the operation with an iron is performed.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with throbbing, phlegm, and fever, and whether there is redness and if you feel it when pressed, then do not rush with puncturing it, but treat it with what assists in maturation until the severity of the condition subsides.
Then you must have the woman lie on a bed with two supports; have her recline on her side and place her feet at the lowest part of the abdomen, and her thighs spread out; put her arms under her temples; and bind each limb with suitable bandages.
And then the midwife, standing on the right side, administers the instrument with which the opening in the breast is made, the shape of which will be evident in the procedures that will follow.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you must insert, with the rod, the nipple of the woman's breast, and what enters the breast from the instrument should be no more than the nipple and the surrounding area. But if the instrument is larger than the nipple, then you must place powders on the nipple's surface, so that the instrument is prevented from entering the nipple.
And you must place the liquid that is on the instrument's tip on the upper side, and have the attendant hold the instrument and turn the liquid until the opening of the breast is exposed.
And when the secretion appears, and it is touched with the hand and is slippery and moist, then you must dry that around the head with a cloth.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then you must place a piece of cloth soaked in warm oil or green oil (in which some astringent is present) on the area; and place the cloth on the nipple area.
And place outside the nipple, and over the chest, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And it should be treated for approximately two days with the ointment that is appropriate for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the nipple and the area are washed in such a way that it is rinsed with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long gentian has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep within the nipple, then you must be prohibited from treating it with iron, instead treating it with what we have mentioned in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living embryos when they develop in a non-natural way.
It is necessary for the midwife to understand the natural birthing process from its initial signs.  When you see the woman pushing downwards and desiring to breathe the air, and is relieved by the weight pressing on her during labor, and hastens the delivery of the embryo, then know that this birth is natural.  The delivery should be of the embryo at its head, and the afterbirth either hanging or suspended from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, the abdomen should be compressed so that the embryo descends easily.  For when it descends by its head, it also releases the afterbirth, and it is cleansed of excess material with good preparation.
However, a birth that is different from this is unnatural and undesirable. For when the embryo is delivered on its feet, and its body emerges before its head and feet, and one hand, or one foot, or the head emerges, or the belly and is turned forcefully onto its side, and its form is not acceptable.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against errors and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of those things, and what the meaning is within them, so that it may be understood and be established upon them.
When the birth is expelled by natural expulsion, and the woman is struggling with it, and it is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then apply compresses, or what women use, and vaporize the head with collected fenugreek and moist oils.
And then the midwife should gently insert her fingers into the small space and tear the afterbirth, or cut it with her fingernail until she removes the moisture within it. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman must be treated with a poultice of ptilium and a poultice of fenugreek with cumin.
Then command her, have her be treated, to be squeezed and make her sneeze with incantations; and cover her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled soon.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at first, then it is necessary that you gently and gradually return them. But if you do not succeed in pushing it back in, then place the woman on a board and lift her legs up, and then gently move the board down to the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the movement.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then cut them and remove the remains of the fetus, or tie the body to the woman's hand with a cloth and remove it carefully, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must push it upwards, and then turn the fetus gently, and then wrap it, and then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
But when it has emerged into the thighs, then you command him to strain, and make him sneeze with condiments, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you gently return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with a light expulsion.
And if it is not expelled by all of that which we have recounted, then take marshmallow and dissolved gum, and crush them well in a mortar, and then apply this to the area around the woman's vagina, at the lower part of her abdomen. And then apply this warm water compress, until the hypochondria is relieved.
And when the parts around him are soothed, then give him a fumigation of myrtle and place that close to him. And after the fumigation for an hour, then you place him on a bed, and make him sneeze, and hold his mouth shut, and lift from that, and gently compress the lower part of his abdomen, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
The fetus emerges lengthwise, hanging by one of its hands. If it is possible to reduce the hand of it (the fetus), then do so. But if that cannot be reduced, then lift the woman and have her walk.
And if walking is not possible, then have her lie down on the bed, and forcefully massage the thighs, and then administer bandages made of mucilages.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, and then focus on reducing the hand, and reposition the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
The fetus emerges with its arms outstretched, and its face is towards the mother's back. The midwife should hold the baby's hand and gently turn it, and move it with ease.
And when it is repositioned, then place on its head what we have mentioned of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to move slowly, and when you have done that, then have her sit on a stool and instruct her to lean to the right side, and then instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze with remedies. The preparation of the fetus's exit onto the side.
When the mother is delivered of the afterbirth in this manner, consider, and then you cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended by its face and neck, then you cut it at the navel, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then push the fetus into its parts until you have placed it as is necessary, and tell the woman to strain herself several times, and it will be expelled quickly if God wills it.
The delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born frequently, and sometimes three or four, but this is unusual and rarely happens; however, some things are outside of nature, and not alive.
And count those, whether they have multiplied, a second time, and separate them by a piece; distinguish them at the ligament in the navel of each of them.  And sometimes they are expelled as easily as one fetus through natural means, and sometimes through unnatural means as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult during their delivery and reach the point that we have described of unnatural figures, then you treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is ingenious in every way according to how the patient is prepared for healing.
A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  I have verified that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all fully formed.  This was determined through the measurements of renowned scholars.
And all this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for it is easily understood from that small resemblance, and therefore one must proceed with what is appropriate.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have discussed in the division of medicine and it hasn't emerged from the body, and you are forced to use manual procedures, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and not suffering from any of the conditions that could endanger her life.
Then the woman should be placed on her back on the bed, and her head should be lowered and her legs raised.
And the attendant should hold her (the woman) in two places, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body does not move away during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where she can hook her fingers into the fetus.
And suitable places for this: then consider if the fetus is prepared to descend headfirst, and then hook your fingers into its forehead, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or in its armpits, or near the ribs, or under the lower ribs.
But if the descent is feet first, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary that the finger(s) be held with the right hand, and place its curve in the area between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and place the fingers into any of those places we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space/opening.
And then place another finger, or a third if necessary, in contact with it, so that there is a drawing together, and not just a stretching out according to its natural shape alone.
And be moved in all directions, so that its extraction is eased, just as is done with a tooth during its removal.
And it is necessary for the area between them that the stretching be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert those fingers and turn with them whatever is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fet (perhaps a piece of tissue) is expelled, then the fingers should be moved to a higher location; and do this until all of the fet is expelled.
However, if the hand has emerged before the other, and it is not possible to return it by compressing it, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is completely expelled, and cut it either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.
And thus it is necessary that you do the same for the other hand and for both feet.
But if the head of the fet is large, or if compression causes it to swell, or if water is collected at its head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the bony protuberances, to split the head and remove the water, or to cut it with an instrument called an "alundat" (a type of surgical instrument), the form of which will be shown with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter immediately following this one.
And similarly do if the fet is naturally large-headed; and then it is necessary to cut it with a scalpel, or to remove it with an alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head has emerged and is compressed towards the crotch, then it should be split until the moisture within the feet is expelled.
But if it is not complicated, nor subject to swelling, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the belly is suppurated or hydrops, then it is necessary that you pierce it until the moisture within it drains out.
But if the fet is on its feet, then the traction of it is gentle and its direction towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is compressed towards the belly and the feet, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and split the belly and feet until that which is within them drains out.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head remains, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she inserts her hand into the air cavity, and searches for the head with it, and pulls it with the said fingers towards the mother's mouth, and then inserts a finger, or two fingers, into it, and pulls it with them.
And if the mother's mouth is closed by a festering abscess that has afflicted it, then it is necessary that it not be forced; beforehand, it is necessary to administer a runoff of oily, humid things. And administer plasters; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetuses is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned: and what we have said about the living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no cause inside the afterbirth.
And when you have completed all your procedure, then administer what we have said about the treatment of the abscesses that occur from the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then immerse in astringent waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb a fetus was dead, and soon after that fire, again pregnant, and soon after a dead fetus again. A long time ago, an abscess occurred near his navel; and it swelled until it burst, and began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and medicated him for a long time, and the wound was not healed.
Then I applied some strong-drawing plaster to him, and a bone came out of him, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was very surprised, as there are no bones in the abdomen.
And then I thought they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I treated the wound, and removed many bones from it, the woman being in her best condition, and lived in that way for a long time, recovering from the little amount of pus.
And I did not consider this strange, but rather that it is science and helpful to what the skilled physician provides with their hands for treatment.
Of the forms of the instruments necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of dizziness with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of constriction in which the books are bound, with which binding are two twists at the two ends of two strings. However, this twist should be more subtle than a constricting band, and it should be made either of thread or of a wooden stick.
And the width of each stick is about two fingers, and the margin of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle place of the two sticks are two attachments of that same stick, which are already fastened, the length of which is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two attachments are inserted into the mother's mouth, so that it is opened when you revolve the two prescribed twists.
Another form similar to that one, more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of wood or a stick, following the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity, there are two attachments, just as before, and the length of those attachments is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then have the woman lie on the bed, feet hanging down, opening the space between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument like you do with shears, as much as you want to open the mother's mouth until the woman does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients said:
Form of impetus with which the fetus is pushed:
Form of friendship (or perhaps "treatment") with which the large head is contained.
And it is similar to forceps, which has teeth at the extremity, as often happens, and sometimes it is made long like forceps in this manner, as often happens, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw with which it is incised and contained. Form of slight treatment (or perhaps "assistance"):
Form of a hook having a spine (or thorn):
Form of a hook having two spines (or thorns).
Form of a spatula with two extremities with which the head is severed.
Form of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments are used, and the more the types of them are multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the easier their operation becomes and the more powerful they are to men because of their quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, wherever you are prepared, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should command the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with remedies, and firmly press your hand over her mouth and nostrils.  If by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot, and pierce a hole in its cover, and place inside herbs, opening the mother's mouth, like camomile, rue, anise, chamomile, arabic cicadas, cassia wood, and St. John's wort. All of these herbs, or some of them, are submerged in water in the pot, and place that on the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the cavity of the mother.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
However, if this treatment remains ineffective and the afterbirth has not been expelled, then you instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow infusion, and then insert it into the vagina and seek the afterbirth with it.  And when she has found it, then take it and extend it little by little. But if it is attached to the mother's womb, then she should insert her hand as we have described, and when she has found the afterbirth, she should extract it slowly, as directed, so that the mother does not suffer undue stress. Beforehand, it is necessary that it be moved from side to side with ease.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and with herbal remedies.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out by repeatedly trying to remove it. Instead, it is necessary that what has been expelled from the woman's body into her mouth, remains in the woman's vagina, and then treat it with unguents and four-drug remedies. For this will cause it to rot over a few days, dissolve, and be expelled.
But when it rots, a bad odor rises from the head and stomach, and this torments the patient.  Therefore, soothing fumes and appropriate remedies must be administered.
However, some of the ancients already tested the use of fumigation with ground-up resin and dried figs.
Method of instrument with which the woman is fumigated for retained menstrual blood and afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or clay.
And place the narrow end in the receptacle and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigating substance should be placed on the embers of the fire.
And let the person holding it ensure that the fumigating substance is consumed and then replace it with more.
Concerning the treatment of an unperforated child's anus.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which are then described as narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that constriction with her finger; and if not, to perforate it with a sharp instrument, taking care not to touch the sphincter.
And then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it is obstructed, then insert a cannula into the opening for several days, and remove it when the child is ready to swallow.
And anal obstruction can occur due to the consolidation of a plague or an abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the treatment and lead.
Of the treatment of fistulas that arise from below.
Fistulas that originate in the lower area,  being swollen and thick, which arise near the anus externally or in the space of the lower region.
And it is a fistula or several.
And when that swelling is old and flows with moist, white moisture or a subtle putridity, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those that are penetrating are known by what emerges from them through discharge and by windiness; and sometimes the patient's discharge and a strong outflow of worms are present from them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the bladder and into the urethra; and some of these penetrating ones reach the hip joint and the groin.
And how a penetrating fistula into the rectum is distinguished from a non-penetrating one is that you should insert your index finger into the rectum and gently introduce a thin probe of iron or of some other material into the fistula if there is no twisting or obstruction.
But if there is twisting in it, then introduce a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel any of this at all, nor does any discharge, worms, or windiness proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then proceed with the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then the sign of it is leakage of urine from it and prohibition of urination until the area is consolidated with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone, and causes pain around it, then the sign of it is that the probe passes into it if there is no twisting into the bone, and causes pain around the area; and that it may be permanent; and that no medicine will work on it, nor can it be consolidated with ointments.
And for all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of these is the work and vain effort of foolish physicians, upon which you should not rely.
But in the case of one that is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected, as I will tell you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies with their hands under their stomach, and their legs raised up, their thighs bent towards their stomach, and then insert a lead probe, or an iron one if the fistula is twisted, until you know the spot where the probe passes through.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe penetrating through your finger, or something like flesh or pus between your finger and the fistula, then know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
But perhaps someone might say that it is cured in some men slowly.
And the treatment through which improvement is expected is that you apply a fine heated cautery, according to the width of the fistula, as described, and insert this heated object into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the flesh that is fused together in the fistula-like a bird feather's quill - has been cauterized.
And then treat it with some bandages until all the fused flesh has healed, and then treat it with medicines that encourage the growth and healing of flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it will not be cured at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate completely into your finger that is in the anus, and between it and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or pus, and the fistula extends to the surface of the skin, then cauterize the skin at the beginning of the fistula, and use the probe to cauterize, and keep it in the fistula until the cauterization reaches the place where the probe's tip ends, and then the probe is removed and discarded.
And then cleanse those fistulaed tissues, which are like the hollow quill of a bird's feather, leaving no cause for concern.
But if bleeding occurs between you and your procedure while cauterizing those tissues, the best and easiest tool is to cauterize with fire or an acute medicine, for cauterization with fire has two good effects: it cauterizes the fused tissues, and it stops the blood flow and removes excess moisture.
And then treat it with bandages or a woven cloth until the wound is well-covered, and then treat the wound with ointments that promote the growth and healing of hard flesh.
And those medicines that contain astringent and drying properties; when this is done, the wound is already healed and you need not fear a recurrence.
But if the fistula extends to the anus and is distant from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate with it.
And therefore, if you feel a resistance and between you and it is a tough membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation to be done there, but rather to proceed with a route of trust and hope.
This condition can be treated in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach its cavity, so you can insert remedies and promote healing; and do not proceed too forcefully with cutting, for fear of injuring the surrounding tissues and causing the patient unnecessary pain or injury; and then treat it with what we have previously described, for a quick healing will result; or separate the membrane and cleanse the pus that collects within, near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp end, and then clean the fistula wounds within the cut, where you can apply a scab; and then strive to restore the whole wound through cutting, and if the opening above is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the anal area, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus near the body surface, with the string or at the edge of the anus, then use a probe with a pointed end, which is similar to a needle prepared in this way:
and insert it into that, wrapped with five threads or around them; and then insert the probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
However, if it penetrates the edge of the anus close to the inside, then you pull the thread from that hole as if you were inserting your finger into the anus; and pull out the thread's end and tie the two ends together, tightening each one, and leave it for a day or two. And whenever you cut the thread into the flesh, firmly tighten it until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls off.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way you are prepared, but not too deeply, because it is not up to you to do so lest you cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the spatula with which the fistula is cut: one curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that you don't cut what's unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks like bunches of grapes, or they are like the grapes of a bunch. And they are small and large, and the blood flows from them constantly and is one, or many, and they are outside the anus, and on its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the degree of little moisture, from which runs yellow water or a little blood with a continuous flow, and it is according to the color of the body.
And the cure for those that are inside the anus is to command the patient to sit down and to strain until the anus is open and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grasp and lift them with tweezers or your nails, and then cut them away from their roots.
But if the tweezers cannot hold them because of their moisture and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth or cotton or wool cloth, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them and sprinkle some hot powders over them near the incision, to act as a cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not open, then prick the patient with a small-pointed instrument, and wash it with what is inside the anus, and make it open slightly when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is superficial, and you should grasp them with your finger or tweezers, and cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And when you have made the incision, you must apply sutures to them in this manner: take a thread wrapped around it, insert it into a needle, and then pull the hemorrhoids apart, and pierce it with the needle on the other side, and tie the two ends of the thread on the part below the needle, laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong tightening, then tie the thread and remove the needle.
Do this to all of them, and leave one unsutured, so that excess blood can drain from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in warm oil or ointment on the anus; and place it on the anus and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it subsides; and when it has subsided, treat it with ointments or other remedies until it is healed.
And since they are old and no longer respond to that treatment, then you should scrape them with the point of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist and the skin pus on top is removed, which prevents them from healing; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then you should scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first, until much blood and they are raw; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a boil, that is a key point, and is a small round sore in the color of the skin, resembling a nailhead, and arises on the whole body, most often in the parts below the feet and on the fingers, and usually results in pain due to its presence.
And then it is necessary to incise what is around the boil, and hold it with forceps or tweezers, and uproot it from its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described in the preceding chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round prominence on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And the treatment for it is to scrape and cut that, or to squeeze it with a file or a piece of wood until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize this, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
However, a pimple is a small, fleshy or fistulous, large prominence on the body's surface, often found on the buttocks.  When the cold encounters it, the affected person feels a sensation similar to an ant bite, and it appears around the body.
And the treatment for it is to take a hollow tube, made of a hawk's or a vulture's feather, which is strong.  Place that over the pimple until the tube surrounds the pimple completely. Then, move your hand with the tube until you cut that which is in the pimple's circuit, and place it onto the surrounding flesh, to eradicate the pimple from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron according to this method:
The part above the tube should be thin, closed (that is, unperforated), so that the grip on it is sharpened and its movement is smooth.
And if you wish, cauterize the pimple as previously described in the section on cauterization of boils in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the instruments that are administered to give treatment.
Sometimes treatment is done with silver or bronze or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes it is done with those small and large instruments, depending on those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small, and for those whose buttocks are sore or painful, the treatments for those should be small.
The form of large and small treatment:
The head of the cannula above it, to which the bag is attached, should be wide in this manner; and let it be distinguished where the bag is attached, just as it has been before.
And the lower end of it, which is inserted into the anus, should be tightly closed (i.e., not open) very finely, tapered; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and the largest one a little smaller.
And the bag, in which the bladder medicines or sheepskin are placed, should be a palm in size.
And it should be pierced with many holes, just as it is rolled; and if the space between the holes is the width of the finger.
And then insert into those holes a strong, potent, crude, ten-part or approximately that amount of bile; and secure that with the bag; and when the bag is placed, tightly tie the top of the cruets with two strong ties, and then tighten each hole with that.  However, the nature of tightening it is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be warmed to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
And then the patient should be laid on their back, and raise their legs and place a cloth under them, perhaps a sheet or blanket; and then anoint the tip of the cautery with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then insert that into the anus with ease, and then the attendant takes the bag and squeezes it with both hands forcefully until all that is in the cruet is expelled into the bowel; and then remove the cruet and the patient lowers their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces it out, keep it in as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is better for recovery.
However, if you use this cauterization in illnesses of loose bowels and their discharge, then you repeat the cauterization until healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the anus, then the cruet should be very small and slender, like the cruets used for cauterizing children.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already stated in the division of plague treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I now say that the treatment of those with hands and medicines follows the completion (or fulfillment).
Therefore, I say that plagues are diverse depending on how they are caused and the location where the plagues appear.
And the causes by which plagues are often brought about are like a stone blow, or an incision with a knife or sword, or a blow with a spear, or with a stick, or an arrow, or similar things from many causes.
But the plagues that occur in the body's locations are like a plague that strikes the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the stomach, or the liver, and similar ones in the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with simple head plagues, for the recollection of compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone blow or similar, and the skull has only been cracked, and it is a large wound, and you fear the development of a hot abscess in the patient, then you should quickly apply leeches and phlebotomize the cephalic vein immediately; and draw blood from the patient according to the strength of the patient, unless some cause prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that issues from the wound is scant.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the affected area; and guard the patient from repletion and from heavy food and drink.
But if some cause forbids this (phlebotomy), then reduce the patient's food intake and keep them from meat and strong drink.
And if a hot abscess occurs on the wound, apply a poultice of roasted olive oil or wine with astringents.
But if a hot abscess is certain, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood, and if the air hasn't changed the powder I will soon describe in detail.
And if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or from an incision of a space or similar, and its edges are not brought together by sutures, then bring them together with stitches, as I will describe later on the suturing of wounds.
However, if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is no retention of it but only a slight protrusion, then cut it away and subsequently treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh, roughly in the location of the original tissue. Advise the patient to eat foods rich in fat: cabbage, thickened broth, and similar, until it heals.
And if you find putrefaction in the tissue, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied material and discard it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood might flow, and it is not severed by medicines, then you must locate the artery, and if you find it unsevered, then you cut it with a knife, or tie it off; and if necessity dictates that the above methods are not suitable, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore, you should sprinkle this powder over them, for it will consolidate them before the air alters them.
And the method for the powder is this: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unquenched lime; thoroughly grind and sift them.  Then fill the wound with the mixture and bind it tightly until it adheres well and the blood coagulates.
Then bind it tightly with dressings and leave it, and do not remove them until it is no longer inflamed, for the medicine will not be effective until the wound is healed.
And sometimes this alone is enough, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood available.
And the same procedure works on large wounds when it is necessary to apply it to them and bind them tightly, especially fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air hasn't yet altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially during summer, then this powder application is not appropriate.  Instead, treat them with what we have already described, or apply digestive ointments, or powder made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until it forms a paste; then treat them with the other cures until they are healed.
But if a small fracture occurs in the bone, then you extract it with skill.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of wounds of the neck.
But if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between that and a simple wound of the head.
But if the nerve or artery of the neck is cut, then if it is a nerve, do not apply anything that causes strong astringency, such as zinc or vinegar, which is vitriol, and similar things, for they harm the nerves and counteract healing. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the limbs.
And if this is treated with mild medicines, such as washing with clean water, sometimes infused into oiled or un-oiled ointment, and poultices when washed with clean water and other soft stones following this method, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or close its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or has descended to the lower part of the flesh, then pierce it in the most depressed location.
But if an artery has been incised in the wound and blood flow has resulted, then separate or cut it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or the entire neck have been incised, and the veins of the neck are saved, then you should stitch the edges of the wound along the neck bone and do not touch it; first align it and return it to its natural shape, and then tighten it with suitable bandages and leave it for a few days. Then treat it with ointments that have a styptic and healing effect until it is healed.
But if the wound has reached the bone, you must treat it, and if there are fragments of bone within it, remove all you can; and what you are unable to remove, leave until the wound begins to fester and separates, and the discharge is reduced.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle the powder recommended to you on it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with whatever remedy is mentioned in the appropriate chapter.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you note its depth, then consider further if the wound is ventilated when the patient breathes; if so, know that the wound is fatal.
And if there is no great depth to the wound, and it is recent with its blood, then you place on it at first powder, and do not press it so that the blood is not trapped in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but put an attracting ointment on it, and remove it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available to you, then place old cloth over the wound opening so that it absorbs the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that the trapped fluids drain out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound, and you do not observe spasms, tremors, or a bad heart condition, or constriction of the windpipe, and the other conditions are good, then know that the wound is salvageable; and then treat it with poultices and other remedies until healed.
But if healing is impossible, and the wound is perpetually open, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat it according to its own specific procedures.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or blade, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if the wound has penetrated the bone, and already detached pieces are present, then you should try to extract those detached pieces by forcing the wound open. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound has healed, for the extraction of those pieces will be easier then.
And for other wounds occurring on other limbs, the method of treatment is the same as that which we have already described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment which occurs in the abdomen is either severe, or mild, or moderate.
A small rupture is more difficult to repair in another way, and if the reduction of them is more difficult, unless you quickly return the intrusion of them to their place, for it opens and enlarges, making their re-insertion difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is moderate, because in that one, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that abdominal suturing is performed in four ways, but two sutures are common and applicable to the suturing of other wounds in the body.
And two other specific sutures are applicable to other wounds, but nonetheless, they are more pertinent to abdominal suturing.
And I will explain each to you with exposition and declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has protruded through it, and it is difficult to reduce, then this is in one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, you must warm it as follows: you should submerge a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone, or in water with squill, cyperus, and pepper, and apply this to the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this is done with vinegar, which has astringent properties, and is better than just water in resolving the inflammation.
And once you see the inflammation resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow root and mallow have been boiled, for this alleviates the discomfort with little effort.
But if the discomfort is not relieved by this treatment, then carefully cut the rupture a little with an instrument used to treat hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate and does not involve cutting, and there should be no attempt to dry it out unnecessarily and risk further harm.
Concerning the instrument, note its shape:
One part of it is sharply curved, the other part is not sharp, and the tip is slender, but not as slender as a spatula; rather, it is slightly blunt.
And thus, if the wound is aggravated and the intestine has protruded, then its reduction should be according to its natural form, back into its proper place, if possible; for that is best.
But when the rupture is wide and in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise the patient's head and feet higher than their lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then always keep your attention and consideration on this, so that the part where the wound is is higher than the other.
And thus you should apply this to large wounds and to medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant hold the rupture with his hand and close the edges, and then determine whether there is any other reason for the suture or additional cause.
And this is the common method of suture: one who takes the needle, or a count of needles according to the size of the wound; and then places the tip of the rupture on the ring finger, and tightens the needle one, or another, so that you don't put faith in the two ends of the cord, with two ends of the thread that is under the cord of the inner parts, until you have made it penetrate that part; and you have already joined the two ends of the cord and the two ends of the thread, making four knots.
And then tighten with a double thread around the needle, and sometimes from two parts together, and then close the two edges and the wound with a proper closure; and then leaves the thickness of the finger and puts another needle into that, and then ties that with thread just as it was tied with the first needle; and do not stop doing this if necessary with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness between thick and thin, for thin needles easily pierce the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the thread, and therefore, they should be medium in both thinness and thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted into both ends of the thread too quickly, so that the flesh is not pierced easily and the wound is broken open before its healing.
And do not prolong the suture so that the wound is prevented from healing.
And then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not bother the patient during their rest; and you will place on the suture, powders spread everywhere, that hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know the wound has healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient for their suture.
However, the second suture is common:  and it is that you suture the four ends of the thread and two ends of the cloth simultaneously, with a needle that is proportionally thin and thick enough.
And then, when you have pierced these four ends with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same place where you began, so that the thread retracts from the most superior part to the wound, so that the suture is like the stitching used to join fabrics together.
And place between each suture the thickness of a little finger.
And this suture is known/recognised by men.
And with such a suture, I closed the wound that had befallen a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife.  The wound was a gap/break of more than a hand's breadth, and the intestines had protruded about two hand-breadths from the middle of the wound.  The rupture was in the middle of the member; and thus I reduced that protrusion of the intestines, which had been outside the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of 15 days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he was healed; and after this, he lived for many years, and remained in his usual state/condition.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and by a miracle it was, for I did not heal him with ointment, for it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine was found.  Instead, I placed old wool on the wound twice a day, and applied frequent washes with honey water until he was healed.
But I shall describe two kinds of sutures, proper according to the account of Scripture.
And it is that you begin with a suture of the thread, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus, as the needle penetrates the thread and into that same tear, following its straight line and length along the whole wound, and leaves the end of the thread at the point where you inserted the needle; and push the needle from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And then, when you have made that penetration, you then make that penetration again in the same wound end from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and push the needle into the other end of the wound from the inside to the outside.
And push with that your penetration with which you push the penetration into the thread at the wound end, which is on the patient's side, until all of that penetrates.
And then, starting from this same side, stitch it with the end of the thread on the other side, and pull the needle out of the thread which penetrated, and then return it to that thread and stitch the end of the thread that is on the other side with this end of the wound; and pull that out of the thread that is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once more again until you have sewn all that is outside following that example.
And the summary of this method of suturing is that you stitch with a hide-like stitch, with which you sew skin, so that you stitch the thread once from the thread end, and you leave it again until you have completed it.
However, the second proper type of suture, which you call Gaulish, and this is being told to you by him and for him, is that you sew it according to a similar method with which some physicians sew it, so that they bring each part to its matching part on him appropriately by nature; and they apply the end of another one of his and the end of the wound to the other end of his, and this is done as I have told you.
You must put the needle into the end of the wound near the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that area, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in two ends of the thread.
And then turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other ends of the wound on the opposite side.
And this method of suturing is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which prior mention has been made.
This is the Gaulish method.
And some might say that the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, which means that you insert a thread into each of them, and begin by inserting the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who know how to sew the skins evenly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle part of the belly, then the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment of plague is the judgment of other plagues.
Which means that when you manage a recent plague with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the bowel to its place and sew it up and prepare it properly, then apply incarnating powder over it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply some of the ointments that you have present until they form a hard scab and the pus falls out, and they are consolidated, cleaned and looked at; and then treat it in the same way as the treatment for other plagues until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines present, then apply immediately, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old cloth, and change it twice a day, as you were taught, until it is healed, for you will not need another treatment in many cases when the plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague will spread to the major limbs, then you should soak lion's wool in oil of good quality, or in scented oil, and place it around the areas between the armpits and under the arms.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in their bowels, which often happens, then treat it with black astringent wine, and especially if the hardness has reached the bowel and has made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large bowel is easier to heal than that which is in the small bowels.
And it is difficult to heal, for the bowel called the "jejunum" does not receive a cure from a plague that affects it completely; and this is because of the large number of veins within it, and the size of those veins, and the delicacy of its structure, and because it is close to the nature of the nerves.
But if what proceeds from the plague is the tissue, and you get a fresh one, reduce it according to your method for reducing the intestines likewise.
But if it has progressed to that stage and is already green or black, then you should press that area with a cloth over the darkened spot, so that blood flows, for there are veins and arteries in the tissue.
And then you should cut what is around that ligament, and place the two ends of the cloth hanging from the part below the plague outside of it, so that the pull of it from the wound closure and the release of the plague's arm is alleviated.
A reminder of the plagues when they occur in the bowel.
When a rupture occurs in the bowel and is small, it is possible to restore it in some people.  Therefore, I saw one who had been wounded in their belly with a lance blow, and the plague was on the right side of the stomach.  The plague was old and had become a fistula, and gas and wind escaped from it.
Then I considered the cure, though I was not confident in its success, but I proceeded to treat it until it was healed and the area was consolidated.
And after I saw the area healed, I asked the patient about further problems in their belly; and no further harm came to them, and they remained in their usual state, eating and drinking, and then bathed and were engaged in their usual activities.
And some experienced people have said that when a wound occurs in the bowel, and it is small, it is necessary to treat it in this way: you should take nettles with large heads; and then bring the two edges of the wound together and place one of those nettles, with its mouth open, over the two edges of the wound. Then, when it grasps them and closes its mouth, cut off its head, as it adheres and is not dissolved.
And then place another nettle next to the first, and do not stop doing this with nettles, one next to another, according to the size of the whole wound.
And then you reduce that and close the wound; and those heads remain attached to the bowel until the bowel is healed; and you do no harm to the patient.
And it is possible that the bowel can be bound with fine thread made from the bowel of an animal close to it, after being put through a needle; and you should take the extremity of this thread, and it should be very lean, and tie the end of it to the other thread, wrapped around it, and then thread this thread through the needle and close the wound with it, and then return it to the break.
And this method of suturing with nettles is only according to a path of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, for then there is no cure but a mere alleviation, and it is not a complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of sores and fistulas.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and is ulcerated and not healed and continuously discharges pus and is not excised, then, in any limb, is universally called a fistula and we call that a sore.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hard, white, fibrous growth, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's nest; and for this reason, that ulcer is called a "wrenched ulcer," that is, a nest.
And in some people it is moist, which discharges pus; and easily the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes large, and sometimes small.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and their cure with medicines, in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you aware of the treatment of fistula, which is done through surgery with the hand.
And know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; for among those are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spine, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the spinal vertebrae, or to any of the joints formed by such composition as of the hand and foot; and those are those that damage the proximity of the principal limb and similar things.
And therefore, that fistula among these, which is in this way, is among the difficult-to-heal illnesses, and does not receive cure, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
And if any of these fistulas does not go to the depths of those places mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and want to understand it, then take a probe of iron or steel, and if the fistula runs in a straight line, explore it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, because of the lightness of its body, is light and bends towards the tortuosity.
And if the fistula is very grievous, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Then irrigate the opening through its openings, for the moisture with which you irrigate it goes towards the other openings and flows from them.
And then inquire meticulously, according to the manner that is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and if the cavity of the fistula is distant or close, or if it is a fistula with many openings and this all lies within the totality of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the location of the pain through your pressure with your hand on the area, and similar indications and the accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all those matters with true discernment, then proceed to the cure according to confidence; and it is that you now consider whether the fistula is a superficial, nearby fistula, or in a salty location, distant from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places that I have mentioned to you.
Then you dry the fistula according to what has previously been said about its description, and remove what is in that filtration and corrupt flesh, and that which has arisen in the opening of the flesh, or of pus and similar things, and cure that until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of deep location, and it is considered appropriate, then it is necessary to cut into it as far as possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh; and then administer some compresses with sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have opened with an iron tool.
And do this with those compresses several times until the sharp medicine corrodes everything that remains in the cavity of the fistula of the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you must inquire into it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not find any cause of a vein or nerve or major limb that prohibits it, as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape that until all corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that causes flesh to grow until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and still emits pus as before, then know that you have not achieved complete eradication of the corruption; and therefore you must expose it again carefully, thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with your final strength, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which has not been reached, and therefore there is no remedy for you but to leave it alone.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then you remove it with delicate forceps suitable for that.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously perform the extraction of all of them, and leave no trace of them with your strength.
However, if you encounter any difficulty due to moisture, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then cut those ligaments or flesh if they are present, and expose the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place something over the wound that may close the wound, and leave it until the area around those bones is free of flesh and ligaments, and be careful that the wound does not become consolidated, and that the incision you made in your procedure is constricted.
However, if you fear it, place on it cotton soaked in oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian unguent, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments will be softened, and the bones are separated from them, the removal, and the extraction of them, is eased.
But if it is a large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone, or similar to those, and only the surface of it is corrupted, then scrape that with a rasp only on the back until that blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the part of it that is corrupted is a large portion, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and cut all the way to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I will recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use it as an example and help for your procedure.
There was a young man, around 30 years of age, who experienced pain in his thigh.  The swelling/matter within the body spread until it reached the thigh.  It was a matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and it was not caused by an external factor.
And then the time passed with this condition due to the error of the physicians until the abscess opened, and many matters flowed out.  His recovery was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings formed, which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
And so, many physicians treated him for about two years, and none of them were truly skilled in the art, until I was called in.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings throughout his body; and the man's entire body was emaciated and his complexion was yellow.
Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings and the probe reached the bone.
Then I carefully examined all the openings and found them leading to various parts of the leg.
Then I incised one of those openings until I exposed part of the bone, and found it decayed, already black and rotten; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, having penetrated deep into the marrow.
Then I closed what I had exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I judged that it was not in the bone itself, but rather that corruption that I had cut out and closed, and I had already cauterized it.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I again opened and exposed the bone a second time, over the first exposure, and found continued decay with the bone.
And I closed what appeared to me of that decay, and then I was forced to attempt the healing and restoration of it, but it has not been restored.
And then I exposed it again, and did not cease to cut into the bone little by little, in particular, and attempted its restoration, but it was not restored until I cut around a palm's width of it, and removed its marrow.  Then I restored it with medicines, and it was slightly consolidated and healed.
And further operations or cutting into it are not necessary, except for the weakness of the patient, their low tolerance, and their fear of death, for he was experiencing fainting spells at all times due to excessive evacuations/drainage.
And thus healed is by complete healing, and there is nothing in place of bone but hard flesh; and its condition in his body is good, and its strength returned; and it is restored to its proper condition, and I did not see any trouble in his walking or harm in any way.
But if the bone is protruding from the body, then you must cut it in this way: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone, and instruct someone to pull it outward; then place a thicker wool bandage over the first bandage; and now tie it over the flesh below the bone, pulling the end to draw the flesh back into place, and you should expose the flesh where you want to cut, so the cut does not damage the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or plank under the bone properly, for when you do this, the cut will not be prevented from cutting through the corrupt flesh.
And the cutting should be done little by little over the affected area, because if the corruption is within the cavity of the bone and not apparent on its surface, more cutting will be needed.
And if the bone is corrupted but not protruding, with one part still attached to the other, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you should expose all the flesh; then put wood underneath, and then cut from the first part where the corruption is until the cut extends to the other part.
And let the cutting be done according to the location of the corruption, a little at a time, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is connected to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in a logical place but in a hidden, indirect one.
And if the corruption is in the bone of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever manner it appears to you, and expose it, and clean it according to every possible arrangement, and by any means, to be corrected, as long as it does not conflict with any vein or nerve.
And know that the instruments for cutting and sawing these bones are very specific to the placement of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, their size, their hardness, and their rarity. Therefore, you must prepare a suitable instrument for each type of operation.
And know that this operation indicates to you the type of instrument you need; when great study, long experience, and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience with illnesses, are yours, then you yourself will know what instruments are appropriate for every illness.
And I am giving you, at the end of this chapter, the list of instruments you will use as simple tools with which you will proceed to your procedure, which you will test on others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of a larger saw:
Form of a ray: Let the head of this ray be in the shape of a star-shaped head, and its points be in the shape of the points of a lancehead.
And it is not suitable except that with that [the ray], the heads of the joints be cauterized when they are corrupted, or the mouth is large and wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a broad razor:
The shape of a well-made saw should have a large, high arch, with the sharpness of iron and the blade of a well-made wooden dagger. Form of it:  (or  Shape of it)
Shape of a razor with a concavity:
Another slender/refined shape of a razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved end:
Shape of a small razor resembling a tentacle:
Shape of a smaller/another cutting tool:
Shape of another cutting tool; this one resembling a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the process of dealing with bones:
Shape of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of a bone that is perforated:
And its tip is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, all the things we have said about razors, cutting instruments, and saws should be.
Of incision tips and the sawing of bones.
The extremities [of the affected area] may be affected either by an internal or external cause, or if your treatment with those medicines fails to resolve the corruption.  Or, sometimes, the corruption moves within the limb, unchecked by any external cause.  Then it is necessary that you incise that limb where the corruption is most present, to prevent the patient from succumbing to death or the worsening of the limb's condition.
And the sign of the affected area is that the limb turns black, as if fire has burned it, or it gradually darkens until the hardness spreads throughout that limb, seizing it and affecting the whole body; and therefore, treat it with incisions.
And similarly, if the corruption is caused by the effects of poisonous creatures such as scorpions, vipers, or other similar things.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then you incise the finger, and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you incise it at the root of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread to the upper arm.
And if, instead, it affects the arm, then you incise the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond the elbow, then in that case death is the fate of the patient; and administering any other treatment for this is a waste of effort.
And similarly, do for the foot; when corruption reaches the toe of the foot, then you incise it down to one of the bones.
And if it spreads to the sole of the foot, then you incise the entire foot. But if it rises to the knee, then you incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no cure for them, but only release, and leaving the patient to death.
And the way to incise or cut the limb is to tighten the ligament in the part just below where you want to incise, and tighten another ligament over the spot.  And the minister should extend a ligament downwards, and the minister extend another ligament upwards; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a sharp tool until all the flesh is exposed; and then it is to be incised or cut.
And it is necessary to place cloths on all sides so that the area does not come into contact with the body, and that the patient receives a well-fitted and carefully treated wound.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while working, then you cauterize the wounded area carefully, or place some blood-stopping powders on it; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, the same accident that I and you have recounted, which is that he suffered a dark discoloration on his foot, with a burn similar to a fire's combustion.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it spread to his entire foot.
And then that man, realizing that the treatment was going to the affected limb with the intensity of the pain and burn he felt, himself cut open that foot down to the joint, and the wound healed.
For a long time, that same corruption happened to him in the finger of his index hand.
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to counteract that excess with what I could place on his hand, to cleanse his body; but the excess was not repelled, and it began to move to the other fingers until it spread to his entire hand.
And he urged me to cut open his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and fearing the death of his hand due to the incision, because the patient's strength was waning.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and later it came to me that that man prepared himself and cut his whole hand, and he was healed.
And I have not related this story except to be of assistance to those who suffer from this illness, and to serve as a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas using medicines.
When an abscess occurs on a fleshy limb, and the space of the abscess extends until it collects pus, and it is then broken and perforated, and the pus is released, and the place remains empty, like a vessel, and the surrounding skin, like thin cloth, has not undergone further corruption, and it has not affected the bone, nerves, or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and is not called a fistula.
However, if the space extends until the corruption affects any part of the limb, then it is called a fistula, and not a sinus.
And the treatment of it is to cut away that surrounding skin completely, especially if it is thinned and like cloth, and ensure that it is not adhered to the affected area due to its corruption.
But if you expect the skin to adhere and that corruption has not progressed further, and the skin has broken open, then you treat it with an enema.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large, and the arm you are treating has a foul odor, then give an enema with Egyptian medicine, which is made of oil, sour wine, and vinegar taken in equal parts, and combined in a vessel, and heated over the fire until the medicine turns reddish-brown and acquires the consistency of honey.
Then, take what is necessary of it and dissolve it with water and honey; and use this mixture as an enema for the sinus, and compress the opening, and leave the medicine in place for two hours.
Then, remove that with a compress; and do this for so many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.
And sometimes it is treated with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and you should take the ash of wood, and put water on it; and then strain that and use it to give an enema until you believe the sinus is closed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then give an enema with water and honey mixed with crushed vinegar, and give an enema with wine and honey mixed, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when the wine contains an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and believe the sinus is healed, then give an enema with something that promotes the growth of flesh in that place.
And you should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with warmed oil and astringent wine; or give an enema with other medicines and ointments that have the properties that I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so the enema tube cannot be inserted, then widen it gradually with a small iron, and apply heat wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should bring the edges together with sutures and leave it at a size that the enema tube can enter without difficulty.
And if the opening from which the pus flows is elevated, then drain it to the lowest part, so the pus flows downwards, because when the pus is trapped within the depth of the sinus, flesh will develop there.
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus to the desired lowest point, then you must prepare the limb with a preparation through which the pus flows easily, as is appropriate, and that no impediment is left in the sinus to hinder the flow of the pus.
But the one over the sinus opening, which remains in place continuously, so that the pus contained within the sinus flows out. And so that you may know whether the pus flowing from the sinus is copious or scant, or digested or undigested.
And by this, consider the location of the sinus, if the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged over the sinus opening has already adhered, or is beginning to adhere, then on the third day, you should remove the adherence, and when you remove the dressing, change the cloth and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle virus quickly spreads, then do not despair of the adherence of it, for the healing of it comes about, for there are some people in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and others in whom the opposite occurs.
And if for many days undigested matter has been discharged from the sinus, then know that the sinus has not adhered; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause prolonged, then you must adjust the drying properties of the remedies, and if the remedies are moist in their substance and their effect, make them dry, as a diaphanous ointment, when the superfluous addition of the astringent has been adjusted.
The final remedy, by which it is healed, is to take diaphanous ointment and dissolve it in rose-oil, and add some old wine that is strong in its substance, and mix it well with that, and use it.
And similarly in that action, when there is no pus, use diaphanous ointment, honey when it is cooked until thickened, and apply it; or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind it all into powder, and sprinkle it on the honey while it is on the fire, and then apply this to a cloth and apply it to the sinus; and apply this with the honey, which has been cooked until it is thickened, and sprinkle it on a cloth and apply it.
Sometimes, long aristolochia root and the root of the lily of the valley (and it is the lily of the valley), and the flour of erts and centaury are administered with it. Use these simple ingredients, or mix them, grind them, sieve them, and powder them over the honey I have described; use this.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the deeper part, and it is investigating the bones or other hard parts or ligaments; then treat it with a fistulous cure, as stated above.
Of the treatment of felon, and bruised nails, and the incision of the added finger and sectioning (of it).
A felon is an abscess which arises beneath the nail of the finger of the hand or foot, and often arises on other fingers.  And when it is prolonged and its treatment is less successful, or is an abscess of a hot abscess, or is corrupted, and it discharges pus until it rots the root of the nail, and often completely corrupts it, and often extends its corruption to the bone until it is foul-smelling, and the end of the finger is blackened, and its colour is dark.
And therefore, when you have done what we have said in the division and your treatment does not work, then you must cut away all the remaining excess of the nail with an iron tool, and then cauterize the wound nearby, for cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail's outgrowths are already pressing the flesh inward and beginning to sting and inflame it, then you should place a thin, sharp object under the edge of the nail that is stinging the flesh, and lift and cut that flesh easily, and apply something corrosive and burning to the remaining flesh until it is all gone; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut the bone out and remove it, for a diseased bone is never healed.
And if the decay and corruption spread to the finger, then you cut it at one of the joints, according to the likelihood of its recovery, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail has suffered a blow or friction, and there is intense pain, then you must first bleed the patient, and then dry the nail with a sharp instrument using a transverse cut from top to bottom, and be careful not to cut into the flesh underneath the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain, and it will be the cause of excessive inflamed flesh in the area; and then treat that area with whatever relieves the pain.
But a swollen finger, which is born in the hands of some men, is very light in the flesh, and is very light in the bone or very light in the nail.
And some of them are born at the base of the joint, or their origin is in certain joints of the fingers. But that which is born in certain joints of the finger is not harmful, and that which is born in the joints is very easily inflamed.
And for those that are fleshy growths, the incision should be gentle, and you should cut it away from its base using a broad blade.
But for that which is born at the base of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, be careful of cutting it out.
But for that which is born on the finger near the joints, you should initially cut through the flesh in a circular fashion down to the bone, and then use one of those appropriate saws for this, and then treat it until it is healed.
But consolidation which occurs to the fingers (between their joints), whether by birth, or by the healing of a wound, or by a burn, or similar causes, then you must remove that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in warm oil to prevent rapid healing, and separate them, or place a thin lead sheet between them until it is healed as needed.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs on any finger with the palm, then you cut away that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable to the shape of the limb.
Of incisions of veins, these are varicose veins.
Varicose veins are large, twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities that appear in various parts of the body, but particularly in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer purgation of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, the treatment of them with iron is in two ways: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other way is that the vein be elevated and all of it be extracted.
The cutting of it is done in this manner: first, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, foul-smelling blood from the leg is dissolved, then tightly bind the patient's leg from the upper thigh down to just below the knee with a bandage. Then, cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.  Next, elevate the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg upward and downward, until the amount of blood you want and are able to remove has been evacuated, which will lessen the patient's ailment.
And then bind it up, and command the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this is noticed by the patient.
But the elevation of them is done in this manner: you raise the patient's leg, if it is very swollen, and then put it in a bath, and soak the leg in hot water until it turns red and the veins are swollen; or, if a bath is not available, it is exercised with strenuous activity until the limb is warmed.
And then cut the cord (possibly a vein or similar) on the right side of the vein, either lengthwise or behind the knee, or at the lowest part of the heel.
And then open the cord with a hook, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to the touch, and it is towards the appearance of that redness turning to blackness.
And then as you drain it, you see from the cord that white matter, which is the string.
And then you put a lead beneath it until it is raised and falls away from the cord, and suspend that with a hook or pliers.
And then cut another incision near that incision after three days, and then scrape the cord from the part above the vein until it appears.
And then lift that up and cut it in a second incision below the heel, and then pull it out and lift it until it is out through the second incision, and then pull it out of the incision above that.
Do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or furthest up of all the incisions, until all is out; and then cut that.
And if you are not able to pull and lift it out, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and tie it and pull it out, or put lead underneath it and turn your hand in all directions until it is thrown out. And be careful not to cut it; for if it is broken, it is difficult for you to lift it out and it has become a detriment to the patient by that injury.
And when you have completely removed it, then place on the affected area wool soaked in rose-water and oil, both rose-oil and plain oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having twists and turns in which it is wrapped, and is not straight as we have said, then you must cut along every twisted and wrapped part, and then suspend it with hooks until you have lifted it entirely.
And be careful with your incision, that you do not cut the vein and harm it, for it will be difficult for you to lift it out; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which a vein is cut:
It is not so sharp as the hooks, nor does it have a sharp point, so as not to injure the vein; and it is of a thick, flexible shape, for if it were slender, it would cut the vein with its thinness; thus it has superfluous thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is produced in the legs in hot lands, like in Al-Andalus, in the lands of the Arabs, and in the hot, arid lands of India, where little vegetation grows and no trees are born.
And it is easily produced in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its formation is from putrefaction that comes from beneath the skin, like snakes, worms, and insects that breed between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the arrival of this affliction is a vehement inflammation in the leg; then the area becomes blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, like the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap a piece of lead around it, weighing one drachma to two drachmas, and bind that and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
And as many times as there is any cause of it outside the parts, wrap that in lead and bind it. And if it is prolonged, then you should cut away a part of it and bandage the remainder; and do not cut that at the root until it has come out, for if you cut it there, it is constricted and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and possibly a bad ulcer in that place.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from behind it and no cause of it remains within the body.
And from this vein there have been cases of it being a length of five palms and ten, and it has even come to my attention of one that was twenty palms long.
And if it is incised during the time of its treatment, then insert the reed into its hole and pierce it with a long opening through the body until all that is in the matter has been evacuated, and apply a poultice to the area for several days with medicines; and then treat it by the cure for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and it comes to it with many orifices, and a branch comes out of each orifice.
Therefore, cure it in the manner we have described in the division and with what has been said above.
Of the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands "bovine illness" because it often affects livestock, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh, and it moves throughout the body, up and down, and is felt by its movement from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and emerges.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, snakes, and intestinal worms and ascarids are generated in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it travels in the body and is elevated to the head, and reaches the eye, it causes a severe inflammation and enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
And therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, it is only done by observing its movement and appearance as felt, and then you must tightly bind and constrict that which is above it and that which is below it, and then cauterize over it and extract it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then you apply cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the greatest fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the area, as we have said.
And if you see that creature having reached the head near the eye, then tightly compress the area above the eyebrow, and then cauterize over it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the sick person use medicine to cleanse their body of bad putrid humors, and guard against foods that cause putrefaction.
Of a section concerning the sickness (or ailment) of the nose.
This illness is called "nafir" in our land, and it is pain that comes in some members, and then it moves from one member to another.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm.  After I had stayed for an hour, I saw this inflammation move as a worm climbing up it, but more quickly than a worm might, like flowing, living silver that runs from place to place.
And then the pain moved to that location and settled into the muscle, and I remained there for an hour.
And then it moved to the other side of the body until it reached the other arm.
And then I noted that it moved throughout her entire body as I watched; and I was greatly amazed by its shifting from one part to another and the speed with which it moved. And I had already seen this before with my own eyes in this way, but I have seen many others where pain shifts from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my eyes in quite the same way as in the woman.
And I did not think it was anything else than this, because the woman was old, with dry body and exposed veins, and in this appearance the wind-like shifting became apparent to the senses.
And it is necessary that this sort of shifting not appear in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, so you gently and lightly press upon it until that constrained windiness is released, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat it with purging of the body and with whatever expels windiness, and dispel those with foul-smelling pills and with pills of sarap and the like.
Of the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types and according to the parts of the body they strike, for their diversity is such that some have large points, and small ones, and concave, and blunt ones; some are solid, others have three angles, some have tongues, and some have wings/feathers.
And the signs of the brain when an arrow strikes it, and pierces the bone, and exits through the skull which is over the brain, are sudden, violent pain, dizziness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion of thought, vomiting of bile, a difficulty in speaking and loss of voice; and a white, powdery moisture, like the moisture from flesh, oozes from the wound.
Therefore, if these signs appear, then you refrain from treatment and extracting the arrow, unless it is outside.
But the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast, are a feeling of a hard object being stuck in, not empty, and the arrow's movement feels similar to the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and the person experiences coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting; then know that death is certain without a doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are the coming forth of foamy blood from the wound, and the blood vessels near the neck become inflamed, the patient's color changes, the patient breathes heavily, and craves a draught of cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane, which is on the foot, the pain is then near the small ribs, and a large chill is produced with intense pain and sighing, and all the limb muscles are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then easily undigested food comes forth from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is embedded there, some opening from the wound reveals the intestine or tissue or a ruptured bowel, and there is no hope for a cure without removing the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine escapes from the wound, and some cause extends from it to the external parts, and intense pain afflicts the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders and arms, the spinal column, the collarbone, the hip, leg, and similar limbs, are saved according to the better disposition if the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I tell you this, having seen the nature of these arrows, so that you may understand it for your own treatment.
Which is why, when an arrow strikes a person's tear duct in the root of their nose, and I extracted it from the other side, below the ear, the person is healed, and no harm comes to their eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the corner of his eye, beneath the lower eyelid; the arrow had already been hidden, and only a small tip, with which it adhered to its shaft, was retrieved. It was a large, pointed arrow of the kind used by the Turks, with a lion's head on the tip, and no fletching.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill effects occurred in his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat; it was an Arab arrow, one with fletching.  It was already embedded deep within his throat.  I carefully worked around it, then extracted it, and the Christian man was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man that had lodged in his stomach; I thought he would die from it.  After thirty days passed, and no change in his condition occurred, I cut into the arrow and worked to remove it.  He was healed, and no further harm befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his back, and the wound had healed over.  But after approximately seven years, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her stomach, and the wound healed within her.  Her condition remained unchanged, and the woman suffered no harm in any of her natural bodily functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face, and the wound healed over.  The arrow remained, causing little pain, and the condition was similar to the others.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's prince's man, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and had already shifted slightly to the right side; the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow was lodged, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; and then I probed it with a thin instrument, and I felt nothing; but he felt a sharp pain below his right ear, and so I concluded that this pain was caused by the arrow's tip.
And I applied a plaster to the area, one with attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would become inflamed so that the arrow's position would become apparent, and that it might heal over it.
And no significant event occurred at the site to indicate that the arrow had reached that spot; and I continued applying the plaster for many days, and no incident occurred; and the wound healed in the meantime, and the patient remained free of the extraction's pain for many days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and told me about it.
Then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days until it opened up, and with the instrument I probed it, and found the thin arrowhead, which was attached to the shaft.
And then I gradually revealed the wound's condition with that strong medicine until the arrowhead became clearly visible to me, and I spent time with this for about four months.
And then, since the wound had become more extensive, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and to grip it, but I didn't succeed in this way, I continued to work on it ingeniously, until one day I used ingenious methods to remove it with expertly crafted forceps, as their design will be described at the end of this chapter, until I successfully extracted it; and then I healed the wound.
And some doctors thought that the cartilage of the nose was not recoverable, but I restored it, and the wound healed completely, and the patient was completely healthy, and suffered no further ill effects.
And I am telling you the method of extracting some arrows, so that you will have a rule and understanding of what I have said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not completely encompassed by this narration, nor are they contained within the book.
And the skilled artisan compares the little with the much; and what is present with what is absent; and discovers a new operation and a new instrument for removing foreign bodies in the art when they occur.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not expelled from the limbs in which they are lodged except in two ways: either by traction from the location where they entered, or by the opposite force of the other side.
And that which is expelled from the location where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in fleshy tissue, is pulled and expelled.
And if you do not follow this method at the time of its insertion, then you must leave it for some days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and the pulling and expulsion of the arrow is facilitated.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow this method, then leave it for several days and repeat the pulling and movement each day, and it will eventually be expelled.
And if you do not follow this method for some days, then you must pierce around the arrow in that bone from all sides with a thin drill until the arrow's location is enlarged, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden in a part of the body, and is hidden from sight, then you should locate it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it out using appropriate instruments for extraction.
And if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the shaft, and this is not over a bone, nerve, or vein, then you should enlarge the wound until it is wide enough to allow extraction of the arrow.
And if it is held by the ears with which it is stuck, then you should carefully remove the flesh in which it is lodged from all sides using all the skill you can; and try to free it, if you can't, by separating the flesh around the fracture of the ears and twisting them until it is freed.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any location it may be, then you should use twisting of your hand with forceps on all sides until you cause it to yield; and with subtle skill ensure the arrow is not broken and that it is easy to pull out and extract.
And if you cannot extract it at the time, then you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding parts have healed, and then attempt it again when it is less painful. But if it causes excessive bleeding, then you should administer the treatment described in the relevant chapter.
And observe your skill in incision of veins or nerves or tendons, and apply all possible techniques to remove the arrow;  and do this with ease, calmness, slowness and firmness, just as I have instructed you.
And therefore, position the arrow against the wound in the way the arrowhead entered the body, as this is more beneficial. But if this is not possible for you, then you should administer what is possible for you according to the figures.
However, if the arrowheads are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of it is already outside the body, or if the arrowhead is curving due to the part above the nearby bone and sometimes even above it, then you should cut along that point; and let the incision be equal to the size the forceps would grasp; then pull it out, as it is already loosened.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you should twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead presses into the bone and widens it, then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is in there, then you push it out with it.
But if the shaft is lodged and you want to administer an impulse, then you should insert a curved instrument, so that its concavity fits into the arrowhead's notch, and then push it out with it.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrowhead is loosened by that.
And if the arrowhead is poisoned, then you must carefully incise all the flesh in which the head is lodged, if possible, and then treat it with whatever remedies are appropriate.
And if the arrowhead lodges in the foot, or belly, or bladder, or side, and is close enough for you to touch it with the probe, and it is possible to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to injure a vein or nerve, and remove it, and then dress the wound if necessary, and treat it until it heals.
Shape of forceps with which the arrows are extracted:
Their tips should be like the beak of a bird, shaped like a saw, when they grasp the arrow so as not to let go.
And of these, many different sizes are made, large, small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the constriction of the body.
like a ray, so that the insertion of the body into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the custom of phlebotomizing is described in chapter 16, are: two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the two apparent temples; two veins in the two tear ducts, called *aspicientz*; the vein in the middle of the forehead; the vein at the end of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip;  these are called *algelic*; and two veins below the tongue. However, the veins phlebotomized in the arms are five: one is the cephalic vein, located on the wild side [of the arm], and the people call it "the vein of the head," and it is quiet/still, a medial vein, and composed of a branch of the basilic vein and another branch of the cephalic; the people call that "the vein of the whole body."  The basilic vein is the one situated on the domestic side [of the arm], and is called "citillar," and the common people call it "the vein of the belly."  The vein of the forearm, which lies over the elbow, is the one usually phlebotomized, and the one that appears distinctly above the bend. The salvatella is the vein between the aforementioned auricular finger and the little finger, located in two bends/folds.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins: one is located below the bend of the knee on the wild side [of the leg]; the second is *sophena* and is located below the leg on the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, located below the leg on the wild side; and there are other similar veins in the leg.
The treatment of veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, dizziness, and chronic head ulcers.
And the method of bleeding those veins, as I recommend to you, is to shave the patient's head, and rub the patient's head at the back of the head [occipital region], in the area of both veins with a wide cloth through good friction; then gently compress the patient's neck with a bandage until the two spots of the veins appear near the ears in two depressions at the back of the head; and you feel for them with your finger, and if you feel their pulse with your finger, then draw the blood with a lancet.
Then take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and carefully insert it under the vein along the groove until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. And then lift your hand with the vein and the groove upwards and cut the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be about the width of two fingers; and draw out as much blood as you want.
And then compress with pads and leave it until it is healed.
And already in the beginning of the book, the incision of those and their cauterization have been described.
But of the two arterial veins in the temples, the relief from phlebotomy is for old migraines, persistent and bad headaches, chronic ophthalmia, and discharges of acute excess fluids from the eyes.
And the method of phlebotomizing those is as I recommend to you:  constrain the patient's neck until the two veins appear clearly visible and the pulse of those is felt beneath your finger; and then you should apply the lancet.
And then you should elevate the skin above the vein, using your index finger, and insert the lancet under, and elevate the vein upwards; and cut it in the same manner as you did the other two veins; and make the blood flow according to your need.
And then release the constriction of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for an hour, then place a cloth and powders over it and tightly compress it, and leave it until it heals.
And already the recollection of them, and their incision and extraction, is described at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the treatment of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is suitable for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in old facial ailments, migraines, stiffness, and foul-smelling ulcers.
And the method of phlebotomy for him is as I recommend to you; that is, the patient should compress their neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument called a "fossor" (or "digger"), of which this is its form:
Place the pointed end of the lancet, which is at the head of the "fossor", on that vein and pierce it with a gentle pressure or with another implement in the appropriate manner, and allow the blood to flow according to the amount you desire; then release the puncture of the patient and compress it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, but the phlebotomies should not be sharp-ended as with other phlebotomies, but rather be flat-ended, and phlebotomize it across, because the bone is close by and strong, and the phlebotomy could break it if it is too thin.
However, the treatment of the two veins near the tear ducts is for scabies of the eyelids, for stiffness and inflammation in the eyes, and for ailments of the face.
And the method of phlebotomy is that the patient should compress their neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over their head.
And the phlebotomy should be made transversely, a little lengthwise with a small phlebotomies, because there is no flesh in that location; and if the phlebotomy is thin, very easily the point of it will break.
And then allow the blood to flow as much as is necessary for you, and apply a cloth over that, and compress it for a night, and then release the compression.
But phlebotomy of the nasal vein is helpful for acute fevers and violent headaches, and for facial ailments, migraines, and facial inflammation, especially when it is chronic.
And the method of this phlebotomy is that the patient should compress their neck, and you should then hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin phlebotomizing instrument and insert it into the middle part of the nose along its midline, as the vein is not immediately visible there; and the blood will begin to flow immediately.
You should slowly move your hand with the small phlebotomizing instrument and allow the blood to flow as needed; then apply a bandage for a night, as it will heal quickly.
However, phlebotomy of the two temples is helpful for constricted breathing, the beginnings of leprosy, many illnesses, skin diseases, and badly ulcerating, corrosive sores, as well as herpes.
And the method of phlebotomy on those areas is that the patient should press down on each temple with a bandage; and the physician should be positioned above the patient's head, and the patient should lie on a bed.
Then, phlebotomize the vein along the length with a wide phlebotomizing instrument, little by little; and then draw blood in a measured amount, or according to the perceived need; and then do the same for the other vein.
Then, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning, for the wound will be healed.
And phlebotomy of the veins on the temples is beneficial for small abscesses and pustules in the mouth and gums, and for ulcers and fissures.  It is also helpful for ulcers that are on the nose and the surrounding area.
And the method of phlebotomy in those areas is to have the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage.  Then, you should pull back the lips and look for two veins, one on the right side of the lip, and the other on the left;  the identification of each is based on the blackness of each, and it is also because in the surrounding area are smaller, black veins;  then, cut into each with an incision.
But if there is doubt, and you do not know which of those it is, then you should make the incision on the largest and most evident of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
However, of the two veins below the tongue, the benefit of phlebotomy is for illnesses in the neck and throat, illnesses affecting the uvula, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the method of phlebotomizing them is to have the patient lie between your hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look beneath the tongue.  Look for one vein on one side and another vein on the other side, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to injure your hand while phlebotomizing them, for below those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are the ones that commonly occur in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either a fine-pointed phlebotomy lancet (perhaps one made of myrtle or olive wood) is used, or a knife is used for the phlebotomy—called a `cutellar`—and this is its form:
Its blade should be like this in shape, and is appropriate for opening the concave, full, visible, thick veins, and those that contain thick, disturbed blood.
And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and a finer tip, and is appropriate for phlebotomy of fine veins containing subtle, citrus-like blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilica vein, which is one of three veins, is that it draws blood from illnesses located below the throat and neck, and from those affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, to be very careful and cautious, for there is an artery below it. If he errs and misplaces the phlebotomy puncture, he will cut that artery and cause a flood of blood. Therefore, one should not perform this phlebotomy with a pointed instrument, but rather with a cutting one, like a lancet.
And if the basilica vein is not clearly visible, then you should leave it and move to another vein, or search for one of its branches; or perform the phlebotomy in a visible area near the end of the arm, for that is often visible; and cut it with a lancet-type phlebotomy instrument, as we have said.
But if you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same vein, then first, constrict the arm until you locate the pulse point.  Then, gently tap over it using your fingers.  Then, bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave-cutting phlebotomy lancet, as we have said.  Be careful not to cause a cut by striking the artery in the process.
And when you, by tightening the ligature, see swelling at the spot you've marked with your fingers, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and thus, avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing during the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is arterial blood.  Then you should stop and place your finger over the site for a while. Then remove your finger, and if the blood has stopped flowing (for it often stops), then you should tighten the arm and leave it be.
And watch the patient closely, and be cautious of him/her and do not leave him/her unattended for a few days until he/she is healed.
But if the blood does not stop, and you see that you have no suitable medicine for this, then you should cut the artery, if it appears appropriate to you; for its extremity will be constricted, and the blood will be stopped.  Or, you can take a piece of fig bark, crush it, and apply half of it to the vein site, constricting it with a bandage and powders until the following day.
And if the blood has stopped, good.  But if not, then treat it with whatever is prescribed for stopping bleeding from the affected area.
Stopping the bleeding from him/her is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of the arm's ligaments.
But in the case of a vein, phlebotomy is beneficial, drawing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it is important for the phlebotomist to be cautious in phlebotomizing him/her, because below that is a nerve; and if, while puncturing for phlebotomy, the nerve is hit, numbness will result, and recovery is difficult, and often the person is not fully healed.  This nerve is often apparent through sensation. But if it is hidden from some individuals and is subtle and not obvious, then it is important to perform the phlebotomy with the instrument you use to make the incision and to carefully avoid the nerve using your skill and strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should make the incision along the vein's length.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with diseases of the eyes.
And it is best, if you wish to make a phlebotomy incision, to use an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped lancet; for it is the safest of all veins, as there is neither an artery nor a nerve underneath it.
However, a boil is often slow to appear in some people, when it isn't lanced on the first attempt, but do not press on anything related to that abscess.
The first thing you must understand about phlebotomy is that it is administered for the preservation of health and in anticipation of illness and caution.  It should be performed on one of the veins in the arm, that is: cephalic, basilic, and median cubital; and should be performed in early spring, after fasting in spring and autumn, and in winter close to eating when there are signs of fullness.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the third day, or at the latest, three hours after the procedure.
But phlebotomy, when it is administered, and when necessity and appropriateness dictate, can be performed at night or during the day, at any hour and time.
And it is necessary that a child not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman not be bled until the fourth month until the seventh month, and the elderly who have already passed sixty years of age should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a leaven clyster if they have much retained waste, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities into the bloodletting from the bowels, which are impure, and that they do not harm the major limbs.
And patients suffering from severe nausea and vomiting, nor those afflicted with illness or drunkenness, should not be bled until this is removed from them, nor those suffering from dropsy, and more so, phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and an increase in sexual activity, work, and exercise.  It should also be avoided during fasts, vigils, and any activity that dissolves virtue, whether of the body or the spirit.
And before doing this, consider the subtlety of the humors. If the blood is thick, thin it with foods and drinks and with medications, if this is possible for the patient.
And if no cause prohibits it, then have the patient enter a bath, or engage in some exercise, so that the blood might be thinned.
And perform the bloodletting on the patient in the afternoon, around the third hour, as we have said.
And be sure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful animal influences, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all bodily afflictions, such as excessive exertion, pain, sexual activity, and similar things.
And have present at the patient's bedside the things that men customarily use with their aromatic substances, scents, balsams, and similar things, according to their availability.
And the bloodletter should sit on a cushion higher than the cushion the person to be bled is sitting on.
Then the bloodletter should expose their arm, and the bloodletter should rub that arm with their hand two or three times; and then tie the arm with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is too tight, or if the constriction is with excess, then you prohibit the flow of blood; or if it is with softening, then you prohibit the body from releasing blood quickly.
And then, to produce the constriction, the person to be bled should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and visible to the touch.
And then the bloodletter should anoint their lancet with a little of the appropriate old oil; and then they should place their left index finger on the vein, below the area where they want to make the incision, to draw the vein a little, so the beating stops, because of the veins that you find like a heart fleeing from the incision, and of those is the one that is full of wind, and when you place the lancet on it, it contracts towards the incision, and the bloodletter is deceived; and if the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does open it, that is the tight one.
Therefore, for this reason, the bloodletter must be careful and diligent in all these matters.
And then, withdraw the lancet, but if the vein opens in one attempt, that is good; and if not, you repeat this another time below that spot a little, or above it with haste, if the spot is not inflamed.
And if the spot is inflamed, or the patient is afraid, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for that will draw out the boil too quickly, nor should they enter a bath.
And then repeat the bloodletting if necessary.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will come out as desired, then you repeat the bloodletting in that same vein, adjusting the opening a bit, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, for the area becomes inflamed in many people with little incision.
But if the area is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it serves no purpose; and place some oil on the opening, for it relieves the flow of blood. And olive oil is better for this area than other oils.
And similarly, administer olive oil to every bloodletting, with which you open veins to prevent blood clots, and they do this with treacle, aloe, and saffron when some of those are placed on the area, because the blood is thinned and stirred when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the bloodletting, which often happens, especially in those who have not been bled before, or when the opening is small, then you should cauterize, and place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the area and press it for an hour, because it will dissolve it.
And it is necessary to do this near the exit of blood from that vein, with the aid of that vein or another vein.
And if any blackness or greenness remains in the area for a few days, do not worry about it; and if you wish, place on it some aloes and myrrh dissolved, or some mint or balm extract or similar.
And many times abscesses and swellings occur after bloodletting from the basilica vein.
And therefore, place your hand upon it, and if you find softness under your pressure, then that swelling is dangerous and bad; and then be careful to place upon it something of what we have said, because blood will easily flow from the artery.
And make a poultice with something astringent, so that the area hardens, and then cure it with other remedies until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their constitution and according to the color of the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting at once, that the vein be enlarged for bloodletting and that the bloodletting be broad.
And in someone who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood from them in small doses, and that the opening (incision) be narrow.
And the best method in bloodletting from a vein is a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safer from blood flow and nerve injury, and is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the vein's length and breadth.
And in those who are prone to fainting during bloodletting, you must treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread infused in mulberries or simple heated wine vinegar; and extract a small amount of blood in three or four sessions.
And if there is coldness of constitution, then before the bloodletting, give them bread infused in myrrh syrup or honey syrup spiced with peppers, cinnamon, ginger, and similar spices, or a strongly scented and fragrant syrup.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause is the loss of much blood, then they should drink broth and a very fragrant, subtle syrup; and use aromatic substances such as rue, and bathe their feet with it.
And use the other remedies mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to try a second bloodletting to dissolve their blood, it should be considered that the bloodletting is for significant evacuation, and its virtue is slow, evacuating the blood little by little, according to the amount of the virtue's effect over a series of days.
But if someone wants to have their arm bled a second time, and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But if someone wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite part where it is tending, it should be bled on the second or third day.
However, in a body where the blood is already significantly heated, and is causing fever, blood should be drawn in a single session, a large amount should be removed, and the procedure should be continued until fainting occurs, provided all conditions of bloodletting have been observed; and place your hand on the patient's pulse next to the body of the blood, to prevent death instead of fainting, because this often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant and negligent.
And when you wish to draw blood from the arm a second time, once the vein opening is closed and blood flow is difficult, do not press on it forcefully and do not extend the arm too much, for this is very harmful.
Wait until the second bloodletting; or remove the blood clot that has formed in the vein opening; or apply theriac or saffron, and press lightly with a compress until the blood is expelled.
And if the vein is inflamed, leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then draw it from that location or from the other arm, from another vein.
And the vein called the "arm's cord" is opened for bloodletting instead of the cephalic or basilic veins, when these are not found or hidden, as it is composed of them.
And the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the vessel becomes red and the vein becomes clearly visible.
And then tie it off with a moderate constriction; and then open the vein along the small transverse direction, not longitudinally nor laterally.
And let the opening be wide, and your bloodletting be such that you make a small incision on the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then you re-immerse the hand in warm water and allow the blood to run into the water until you achieve your desired result.
But if you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and the body's blood flow is applied to warm water in the winter.
And bloodletting from this vein is safer than from all other veins, because below it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerve.
And bloodletting from the vein on the right wrist is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
And the technique of bloodletting from that vein is that you hold the arm with a bandage or your hand, after you've put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; then, make the incision across it; and if you cut it entirely, this will not harm it in any way.
And be careful not to injure your hand during the bloodletting, because beneath it are the nerves of the exposed fingers.
And then return the arm to the warm water and allow the blood to flow freely, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be stopped.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the required amount, then you apply oil and salt to the vein so that it does not become closed; and similarly, you should do this to every vein that has been opened.
However, bloodletting from the left arm is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen.
And perform the bloodletting on him in the same way as you did on the other.
And the benefit of bloodletting from the saphenous vein is for illnesses located in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments, retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.
And the procedure for bloodletting from him is that the patient should immerse his foot in warm water and make friction over it until the veins appear clearly; and bind the joint of the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein, appearing near the toe, has many small branches spreading out over the surface of the foot.
And therefore, open the widest vein, either below the leg towards the heel, or near the junction, because it is better and more effective.
And if you open a vein on the surface of the foot, then be mindful of the nerves that lie beneath it on the foot's surface, and perform your bloodletting in a way that cuts across, as if you were intending to make an incision.
And let the bloodletting be done carefully.
However, if the removal of blood is prohibited, then you should re-immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow out until it is evacuated.
And if the blood-letter errs the first time, then repeat the bloodletting a little higher, because the location is safe; and do not fear harming him, but rather be mindful of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly, do the same to the vein of the other foot as well.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, beneath the bone of the outer side.
And the benefit of the bloodletting for him is for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood.
And the procedure for bloodletting him is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly wraps his thigh from the wide part towards above the heel with a long, thin bandage for four days, because it only appears this way.
And therefore, when it appears, then you perform bloodletting in that specific case according to whatever skill you have and according to the cross-section, and that is better; either cut it with an incision or cut it with a section, because the area is salty for him.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear in the sensation of all, then bleed a branch of it, and it is the one that appears on the back of the foot between the so-called auricular and annular [tendons/ligaments].
And beware of the nerves, and make the blood run the quantity you want.
And then loosen the constriction and place a cloth over the site of the bloodletting and compress the area, for it will heal quickly.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping is of horns, or of earthenware, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with incision and the extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping that is without incision is in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping that is administered with incision and blood extraction are in fourteen places on the body, of which one place where cupping is placed is at the occiput, and it is the posterior part of the head; and the middle place of the two sides of the neck together; and cupping of the chin below the jaw, then below the mouth; and cupping of the two shoulder blades; and cupping of the elbow, and it is above the end of the forearm; and cupping of the two armpits, and is of the two arms; and cupping of the two thighs; and cupping of the two calves.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not deplete their virtue, as is the case with phlebotomy; nor should cupping with or without fire be done for any illness caused by fullness until the entire body is evacuated.
But if necessity prompts cupping for illness or for a continuing condition, administer it at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
And therefore, when any of these conditions occur, and especially if it's in the third or middle part of the month, then we command that cupping be done after two or three hours have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the neck is that it relieves heaviness in the head and what is pressing on the eyes; but this must be done after an evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of a phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted to use it for those with cold, or those with a cold, for it causes great harm.
And therefore, it should not be used on the elderly, and on those with cold illnesses.
But for those who are continuously afflicted with it, it causes forgetfulness; and therefore, you should order the cupper to lightly hold the cup at the lower parts, to prevent the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping with alcohol is in place of phlebotomy of the vena fusca and basilica veins: and therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, and constriction of the chest and the cracking of the breathing apparatus, and coughs, and congestion.
And the cupping with alcohol should be positioned slightly higher, for if placed lower, it will engender weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* (likely a type of substance or preparation) is beneficial for accidental head pain, and for ophthalmia, migraine, inflammation, and toothache; and it is used in place of phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And you should tell the cupper not to press too hard with the scarification tool, so as not to cut the artery and cause bleeding.
And cupping below the chin is beneficial for ailments in the mouth, such as gum decay, and similar oral maladies, and is a substitute for phlebotomy of the veins located on both lips.
But cupping performed on both shoulder blades is beneficial for heatstroke, which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two parts within the hollows/sockets is beneficial in place of three vein-openings, that is, the basilica, saphenous and cephalic veins, for it draws blood from all those veins, smaller veins that are in the flesh,  and these small veins from the larger veins, until the draw-in reaches the three large veins.
And tell the cupper not to proceed too far in the scarification, for the area is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping that is used on the buttocks is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and the ulcers below.
And it is necessary to instruct the cupper to use a large, sturdy cupping glass, because the area needs a strong suction;  and flimsy, easily broken cupping glasses are weak and should not be used for scarification.
However, cupping of the legs is less beneficial because it depletes blood from the entire body, and it is helpful for old pains in the kidneys and bladder; it provokes menstruation and is beneficial for coughs and fevers; and it is a substitute for opening two saphenous veins and at that time, two other veins.
However, it greatly weakens the entire body and causes fainting in many men.
And the benefit of the cupping at that point is similar to the benefit of cupping on both legs.
And the quality of applying the cupping is to initially place the empty cupping glass and to create a moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of the cupping, but rather place them lightly, and leave them briefly, so that the humors come to the place by gradual accumulation. And do not stop repeating this and continuing until you see the area already reddened and swollen and that the redness of the blood appears.
And then you make incisions and repeat the suction slowly, and then consider the disposition of the body's ailments.
For that person who has tender skin and is easily bruised, you should make incisions only once, so that the area is not ulcerated.
And command the cupper to enlarge the incision slightly, and to moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then you should make incisions twice, for in the first instance, the path of thinning the blood and its watery elements is opened. But in the second, the scrutiny gained from extracting the thick blood.
And if the blood is very impure, then the incision should be made a third time, so that the impurities are removed.
And finally, when we want to extract a little blood gradually or slowly, a single incision suffices.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions; and if we know the blood is thick, then deep incisions are needed.
And the depth of the incision should be only the length of the lancet.
And if the skin over which the cupping is to be done is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, the areas for the cups should be oiled with softening, opening, and resolving oils; if it is summer, with almond oil, violet oil, or oil from soft berries, or quince seed oil; and if it is winter, with narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or bloodroot oil, or similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be of amaranth, or balm, or almond, or dill, and similar to them.
But if the area to be cupped has wide pores and tender flesh, then oiling is prohibited, and the areas around the cups should be washed with water or cool water of nightshade, or quince water, or burdock water, and similar to these.
And for those whose blood is of moist constitution, wash the areas around the cups with sour wine, or water of myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
And for those whose superfluities are thick, wash the areas around their cups with old wine, or water of tansy (which is majorana), or decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar to these.
And the cupping should be guarded against bathing; having been administered shortly before bathing, for an hour or two, and the patient should rest after the cupping.
What is it that should be regulated before cupping or bloodletting?
Consider this at the beginning: if the person being cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp, inflammatory blood, then they should take things that cool them down, such as fresh milks, vinegar with endive and lettuce, and secanabin, julep, and things similar.
And avoid foods such as poultry, and lean meats, and foods seasoned with acids, and things similar.
And for someone with a cold temperament, they should drink an althea syrup, or a syrup of alcaçuz seeds, and sumac, and a very fragrant wine between old and new; and they should be advised to consume little food and drink, and avoid foods like poultry, hempseed, pigeons, and small birds.
And on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more substantial than the food.
And some men should be given  triacle alpharac, or musk-based medications (i.e. musk or alcelita) before cupping or bloodletting, or shortly before, to strengthen the main body parts and thin the blood; and they shouldn't be given anything heating.
But cupping, without incision, should be applied to the liver, spleen, gout, and the navel, and on the knee areas, and the area around the groin.  For these parts cannot tolerate incision upon them.
And these are not intended for bloodletting from the body part, but rather to draw blood out of the body part, as we apply a cupping glass over the breast in cases of nosebleeds; and we use it to dissolve cold, stagnant air from a part of the body, as we do when placing it over the belly and the navel.  Because this action thins the body part, warms it, and relieves the pain because it resolves the stagnant air.
And it is placed on the sinuses when they are blocked or filled with dust, because by the virtue of strong suction it quickly clears blockages and eradicates dust from its place.
Similarly, it does the same when placed on the liver and spleen to remove any stagnant air contained within them.
And these cupping glasses are used empty, with suction only; and sometimes they are used with fire.
And sometimes they are used filled with lukewarm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and larger, it is either hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
The form of a cupping glass used with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of the bottom be half a palm; and let it be on the patient's back, in the middle of the area to be treated, the hole being small enough for a needle to enter.
Let it be made of red earthenware or citrus wood, with thick rims, lion's, or other appropriate shapes, so that it does not displace the limb from its position on it.
And there should be a transverse rod of earthenware or iron in the middle, on which a candle with fire is placed.
And this cupping glass should be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one should be smaller depending on the illness and the age of the person using it.
The cupping glasses for children and the enfeebled are different from those for young people and those with strong bodies.
And the method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the flame with suitable wood fire in front of a small beeswax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is ignited around the lower part, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it is placed on the patient's limb, and the finger is placed over the hole we mentioned, until when we have the cupping glasses and we don't want the finger to show or the vapor to escape through that hole, the cupping glass will immediately dissolve.
And then light the fire according to its method, and repeat it if necessary.
But a cupping glass administered for the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod nor hole, and is administered only by being filled with water, and is placed on the limb simply.
And this is the form of it: and the larger this cupping glass is, the better, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs in which cupping is not possible due to their small size, like the foot and the gums and similar things; or to a limb without flesh, such as the finger and nose and their like.
And the quality of using those leeches that you have found in the clean, muddy waters of ponds.
And then they should be left in fresh water day and night until they are hungry and there is no residue in their bellies; and then the body should be evacuated initially with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it turns red; and then place them upon it.
And when they are full and drop off.
And if suction of the area with a cupping glass is possible, it is better for healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and rub and squeeze it.
And if the body's blood flow is prolonged near the point of the leeches, and it is bleeding, then you should dip a cloth in cold water, and place that over it until the bleeding stops.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then powder crushed vitriol, or other similar styptic agents, on it until the bleeding stops; or roasted fava beans (or broad beans) can be placed over the area, and left until the beans adhere to the area, and the bleeding will stop.
And if necessary, repeat the use of leeches, when it is possible to change them.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being used, then rub the area with fresh blood, or stick a needle into the area until blood flows; and then apply them, for those leeches that sense blood will immediately adhere.
And when you want them to drop off, sprinkle a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ashes on them, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidental damage to the bones.
O, son, know that foolish and vulgar doctors, and those who have never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them, boast about this chapter.
And for this reason, this manner of science in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at any time completely; and I have not embraced this unless through the length of reading the books of the Ancients and study on understanding them, until I extracted the science from them.
And from now on I will devote myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have now described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experience has passed; since I have shortened this for you and freed it from the occupation of elongation; and I have shortened it at the end of shortening; and I have shown it at the end of the explanation; and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered in that, as is done by adding a declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
Summary and collections regarding broken bones, and the prerequisites for understanding them, before we begin a review of fractured limbs and their various types. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with a summary of the subject matter; and the principles, understanding of which is initially necessary for the craftsman and to stand on the truth of these; that is to say, you and those who are ready to learn or learn this noble art, other than yourselves.
And thus I say that when an accident of fracture, dislocation, twisting, or crushing occurs, then it is necessary that you begin with phlebotomy or a laxative, or both together, if no cause forbids it, such as weakness of constitution, or if the person affected is a child, or old and decrepit, or if it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
And afterward, let their diet consist of cool herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit fatty meats and filling foods, and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are certain of a hot abscess, and if you do not fear an effusion of matter into the limb.
And then return the patient to their initial regimen, with which they were accustomed.
And thus, when the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the patient be fed nutritious foods, rich, thick, and heavy, in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, rice, porridge, boiled peas, cow's belly, eggs, fresh fish, and heavy wines and similar to these; and with this regimen, the fracture is more easily and better consolidated.
And know that broken bones in the elderly and those in poor health, in their first stages of illness, cannot be fully rejoined and healed naturally because of the weakness/debility of their limbs.
But nonetheless, nature unites and brings together over the broken bone from every side a certain glue-like substance, thickened, which adheres to and binds it until it is completely joined and fastened together, until it reaches its full strength and firmness, just as fire in the beginning, until some force prevents it from completing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary to give the patient foods that are heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly, all the other limbs have different types of fractures.
And I come with a reminder of every type of fracture, explained in its own separate chapter.
There is diverse types of fractures themselves. And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for a fracture may be curved, or it may occur in stars; and sometimes a fracture runs along the length of the bone: and those are the fractures of splinters, and stars, and additions proceeding and not proceeding, just as is done in the pen when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a crack and disruption in the head, and a small fissure fracture.
And for every type, there is a particular method or treatment for restoring it, according to the separate reminder in its places.
There are various signs of a fractured bone. And by this a fracture of the bone is known: it is the twisting of it, and the protrusion and appearance of it to the feeling, and so of it when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor is it made by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, and the patient does not experience great pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a twisting or a small crack, so you should not move it with your hand and with a total compression; instead, place on it some of the remedies from which a restoration is remembered for that moment which is appropriate to the location; and then it should be tightened by a subtle constriction.
And know that when the location is bent but not split in two or otherwise affected, as if the entirety of its alignment is misplaced, then you must begin, from your time onward, to rectify it, lest an inflamed abscess occur there.
And if an inflamed abscess occurs there, then leave it for several days until the abscess subsides; and then dress it according to any method you can, by gentleness and ingenuity.
And know that the restoration and healing of this is easier than that of a bone in which a fracture occurs.
And then strengthen it according to what will be the remedy for it.
But if in the bone there is a fracture, then extension of this broken limb, whether the hand or the foot, is necessary; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords or with one cord and the hand.
And be your positioning in which you place the limb back into its natural shape, while the broken limb parts are extended; then you must carefully return those additions to their places with skill and in any way you can.
And take care, according to your strength, that your procedure does not cause further pain or injury to the patient; and be careful, with your skill, to apply one bone to its counterpart in the best possible alignment.
And it is necessary that at that time you carefully feel it with your hand, and if you find any different cause, correct it and put it back into place with all your skill.
Avoid excessive stretching and compression, as some foolish doctors do, which often results in a painful abscess through their procedure, or causes the limb to contract, as we have seen from their procedures many times.
The appropriate level of immobilisation for the still limb is what I am explaining; so you will know that fractured limbs vary in size and form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and similar parts, the wrapping should be of fine, soft cloth.
However, for those that are large, such as the thigh or leg, a firm and strong wrapping is needed, as a strong bandage connects and firmly secures the large limb from every direction, ensuring no gaps or openings.
And then, after you've carefully aligned the limb, apply a suitable bandage to the fracture site, using three or four wraps depending on the limb's needs; and gently secure the bandage with your hand.
And then move the bandage towards the most prominent part of the fracture site, and secure it less tightly than you did at the fracture site itself. Then gently loosen the bandage around the fracture site a little bit, and gradually reduce the tightness, until you have moved the fracture site significantly.
Then take another bandage and wrap it once more over the broken area, and then move the bandages towards the lower part of the fracture; and your action should involve adjusting the tightness of the bandage and loosening it according to what we've previously described for the first bandage.
Then, between the layers of bandages, place some linen or cloth to address any twisting or deformity in the fracture if one is present; otherwise, place nothing there.
Then place another bandage over this, and immediately fasten these well-made bandages if there is no inflammation or abscess present in the area. If there is an abscess or inflammation, apply something that will relieve it and reduce the inflammation, leaving it for several days. Then tighten the bandages over the area.
The splints should be made of half-hardened wood, expertly shaped, or of pine wood, or palm fronds; and the width of each splint should be according to this shape and form.
However, the splint placed over the fracture should be slightly wider and thicker than the others, and its length should correspond to the size and smallness of the limb; then, tighten the splints with another bandage, maintaining your first degree of tightness; afterwards, tie them together securely with thread as already described regarding the tightness, and the tightness should be greater closer to the fracture, and the further it is from the fracture, the looser the tightening should be.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen some fools do, using thick, twisted ropes for thread, that is a great mistake, for it upsets the evenness of the binding.
Likewise, excessively fine threads are not suitable, because you won't be able to achieve the desired binding with them.  And there should be at least a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is complaining of the edges of the splints pressing on their skin, then place some soft material such as linen or padded wool under those parts, so as not to cause them injury.
Sometimes the fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a rupture of the ligaments may occur, and I will discuss this in detail in the second chapter.
And understand that not every broken limb should be bound with splints on the first day.  This is because when the limb is large, you should not place splints on it until approximately five, seven, or more days later, depending on your assessment of whether a dangerous inflammation (abscess) might develop.
And this is the method of plasters with which the ancients treated fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A common plaster method for fracture repair, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children, as it neither generates heat nor cold.  It involves taking powdered flour, specifically the inner pith of the flour that forms on the walls of a mill from the movement of the millstones.
And prepare it as it is, but sift it with egg white, and apply the mixture neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster for treating fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  a recipe using asafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and wild chamomile root, each one part.  Myrrh and aloes, each half a part;  aloes, two parts. Grind and sift all, and mix with a little water or egg white if the patient's constitution is hot. Then use this plaster, for it is a good composition and helps to heal slightly broken bones, and is effective for many people.
Another method of plaster for fractures and sprains:  a recipe using wild chamomile and white marshmallow root, each one part; myrrh and aloes, each half a part; acacia, one and a half parts; Armenian bole, two parts.
All are ground in a mortar with thorough crushing, sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and for accidents causing pain there, and for fissures and fractures: Take wool and soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of restoration, but is effective for treating hot abscesses and relieving pain.
Another method of plaster for restoring a broken bone: take fig leaves and wild poppy leaves; crush them together and make a plaster from them.
A brief method of plaster for assisting in the restoration of a fractured bone, and when you want resolution of any remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and comfrey flour, all in equal parts; crush all together, and mix with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
However, if it is inflamed, then mix it with damp coriander water or with cold water and apply it.
Another, stronger plaster for resolving a hard abscess that hinders the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow, linseed, bladderwrack, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all in equal parts; crush everything, and mix with willow water, or plain water, or wine, all according to the condition of the limb and the colour of the skin.
However, Hippocrates, in his book, does not say that it should be placed on the broken limb for its restoration, but rather a cerot (plaster) made of wax and oil, and no other substance; and recommends that it be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb for its restoration, and the substances in which there is drying and little warmth, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar to those substances mentioned, are used.
A plaster for wounds and pain: take equal parts of cheese, human skin (or bird skin), marshmallow root, and salt; crush and sift them, and make a plaster from the mixture.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain, and when it should be loosened, depends on whether pain, inflammation, or fracture or displacement of the bone has occurred.  If these are not present, then you do not loosen the bandage for many days. And if severe pain, inflammation, or swelling occurs at the site, then you should immediately loosen or remove the bandage, and take off the plaster.
And take linen and a damp sea sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water.  Wash the affected area with it until the inflammation subsides and the pain is eased.  Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.  Next, place a piece of wool soaked in sour wine and oil (or oil alone) on the area, and bandage it for a night, so you are certain the inflammation and pain have subsided.
Then repeat this gentle compression and small plaster application, and do not apply the initial strong constriction again.  Treat it gently until healed.
And if the abscess, inflammation, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you no longer need the plaster and compression, then you should repeat the process as you did initially.
And if no such causes as we have mentioned affect the limb, then do not loosen the bandage for three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes it is left for twenty days, depending on how the limb heals, as we said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh around it coagulates.
Then, increase the compression more than you did initially, and increase the patient's nourishment, according to the patient's recovery.
However, if you find the fracture site already drying out and weakening more than necessary, then understand that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.  Therefore, moisten it with lukewarm water every time you loosen the bandage; and do this for three days. Slightly loosen the compression, and through this action, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal quickly.
But what those foolish bone-setters do, when a limb fracture isn't properly set at first, and it is set crookedly, is an error according to their procedure, a great risk.  If it were correct, the Ancients would have included it in their writings, and they would have done things this way.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, which makes it more reasonable that it should not be done.
Second Chapter: Of fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow with a weapon, and the blow breaks all the bone as far as the skull, which is below the bone, just as it does to a log.  Thus, this type is called a complete fracture; or the weapon cuts a portion of the bone and cuts the flesh, but does not extend through the bone; and this type of fracture is called a simple fracture.
And the severity of these two fractures is either great or small, and a fracture that is a crushing or grinding; and the cause is a blow with a stone or falling on a rock, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane that is beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the severity of these two fractures is either great or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the smallness of the fine hair-like fibers, and therefore this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture that is caused either by a fall or by a blow from a stone, and similar things, which causes some plate of the bone to enter into the interior parts, and is made in the hollowed-out place, as happens to the ribs of the body when they are struck, and a portion of the bone enters into the interior parts.
And this is more commonly found in the bones of moist bodies, such as the skulls of children.
And in all these types of fractures, the pieces are separated, like scattered stars. And I will come with a remedy for all of that, putting it back in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by examining them and investigating them with probes and by examining the decaying flesh that is on top of them.
A capillary injury is recognized because it is visible on the bone, and is wiped clean and inspected with a probe, because the fracture appears dark.
But in the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms, and if you see symptoms that indicate a serious concern, such as vomiting, agitation, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, swelling and stiffness of the limbs, and similar symptoms in the more severe conditions, without doubt the patient is not going to recover.
And if you see symptoms that are not severe, you expect recovery, then you begin the treatment.
The reason for this is that if the injured person comes to you at the beginning of the injury, and this is in the winter days, then you must examine the bone before the 14th day according to all the conditions.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must try to set the bone before the 7th day, lest the tissue beneath the bone be corrupted by the pannus, and the symptoms we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the membrane covering the brain, and is with broken and crushed pieces, then you must cut away the broken and crushed part, as I will instruct you.
And you shall examine the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and method as best as possible, given the nature of the injury, and be gentle with the patient.
And if you encounter a bone protrusion, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you must treat it as appropriate.  Fill the area with cloths soaked in wine and roasted oil, and allow the injury to rest until the abscess subsides, and the blood flow stops; then begin the process of realigning the bone and removing the injury.
And this shall be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a straight-edged scalpel, and this is its form:  And then, apply another scalpel, a little further over, and this is its form:
And then apply another scalpel further still than the second one.
And you need a variety of scalpels, some wider than others; some shorter than others, with sharpened ends, made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease in striking the scalpel so that you do not strike the head and damage it.
And if the bone is hard, then you should drill around it before using the scalpels with the drills, which are called non-deepening drills.
They are not called that because they do not reach the surface of the skull bone next to it, since the drill has a round end or rim on the one below the sharp head that resembles a small rim or circle, which prevents it from sinking into and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
It is convenient for you to take a large number of these drills, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have drills for every part of the skull, with a sharp end, varying in length and width according to the thickness of each part.
And this is the method for three types of drills:  To drill around a fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then change the drill to another location, and place it in a hole of roughly the thickness of a ray or similar width.
Then, using scalpels, cut what's between each hole in the bone, making it as fine as possible, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with another tool, such as finely crafted pliers and forceps.
And you must carefully avoid letting the scalpel touch any part of the spinal cord.
And, having drilled around the bone, and if it's joined to the spinal cord, separate it, and remove it.  You should then scrape and smooth that area where it was connected to the bone using a tool similar to a scalpel, but thinner and more delicate than the others.
And if any small bone fragments remain, then easily remove them with your tools; then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have described.
And another method of operation is gentle, devoid of fear, which the Gaulish authors praised highly.  And this is their teaching:  It is necessary for you to begin by uncovering the portion of the bone in the location of the most severe and obvious fracture, until you have uncovered that area and placed the tip of this slow and gentle scalpel beneath it; and this is its form:
And the lens-shaped portion is smooth and does not cut anything, and the pointed portion is bent in two directions forward along its length, like a V; so that the lens-shaped portion is aligned with the spinal column, and the sharp cutting edge is against the bone.
Then strike the scalpel on one side with a small mallet until you easily cut all the bone in such a way that you are certain the bone does not experience the accident you fear in any way, and if the surgeon were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of medicine; certainly, and if he were sleeping.
Then if any bone fragments remain attached to the bone in some places, you will cut them away with the pointed tip of the scalpel; and will free it with ease, for it is freed without injury and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate the bone marrow, and what is cut away or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and small irregularities remain, then it is necessary to smooth out those roughnesses and eliminate those irregularities with small razors, for which you have prepared a variety of sizes, so that you can administer the most appropriate ones in every location and the most appropriate ones according to where your operation is on the fractured bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that in your process of smoothing the bone, you begin with the widest of those razors, and then gradually use the finer ones, and do not cease to do this continuously until you come to using the finest and most subtle of all those razors.
However, in each of the other small, hairline fractures, it is necessary to administer treatment according to what you perceive as necessary for their repair.
And it is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And this, what we have written, demonstrates [it] in large fractures.
And if the flap of skin is retracted when you reduce the bone, then it is necessary to take a cloth equal in size to the wound, soak it in warmed olive oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in warmed wine and olive oil, and place this over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so as not to aggravate the condition; then apply a wide bandage, and do not tighten it except to the extent necessary to hold the wound closed.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are certain of avoiding a suppurative inflammation; then remove the dressings, and then administer medicines that are beneficial for dryness, such as flaxseed and the flour of barley, and the powders of anise, and of arnica, and similar things.
And you should make these medicines into a powder, pulverized and applied to the wound as they are dry; and universally, administer any medicine whose properties are to cleanse and not to burn.
And be mindful, through your skill, that the wound remains clean in your treatment, and do not allow the application of ointments or other substances that could cause a worsening of the wound.  For when virulence is added to the skin covering the brain, it corrupts and poisons it, and thereby brings about a very wicked affliction in the patient.
And if damage occurs to the brain's structure, especially when the treatment is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if you see these symptoms, which we have described, you know that the condition is dangerous without any doubt.
And if the blackness is not from the wound itself, but rather from the medicine applied, and it is the nature of that medicine to cause this blackness, then you should take a portion of honey and three parts of rose-water, and with this, moisten a cloth, and place it on the head; and then treat it with the appropriate remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in just one part but sometimes in two parts, or even sometimes in one of those parts, because it has two bones.  For the lower portion is cartilaginous, and it's not broken, but rather only shows bruising, twisting, and bending.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and use your index finger to push the fracture inward, and your thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this easily, and be careful not to cause further pain to the patient through your actions.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger doesn't reach it, then it must be set with the end of a rounded, slightly thickened stick (or tool).
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same.
And try to restore it on the first day after the fracture, if possible; and if not, then approximately on the 7th or 10th day you should treat the inflamed area carefully.
And approximately insert a small piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or place two small pads if the fracture is in two parts, and let the padding be of such a size to fill the nasal opening.
Some of the ancient healers say that the pads should be soaked in broth and changed daily, but I do not see the need for this.  Instead, the cloth should be dipped in a mixture of beaten egg and powdered medicine;  and leave the pad in place until the bone is set and the cartilage has hardened.
Sometimes, instead of a pad, a piece of linen cloth, soaked in a healing liquid, is placed in the nose, especially if the nose fracture is severe and the patient is unable to breathe normally.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, do it with pads.
And if, on another occasion, there is a suppurating boil, plaster the nose with a cerot (ointment) or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil, or with diachylon.
However, if there is no suppurating boil, then you should cover the external area with flour of sesamum and powdered herbs mixed with egg white; and then place a linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are fractured, even slightly, or are comminuted, then you must cut away the surrounding tissue and remove the pieces with appropriate instruments.  Then close the wound and treat it with healing and consolidating remedies, and appropriate plasters.
And if a pustule develops inside the nose, then you should treat it with pads and administer lead cannulae until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is without pus, observe if the fracture is merely displaced, and not broken into two pieces but bent inward at the edges, then its repositioning is straightforward.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the aforementioned index finger of your right hand; and push the bent portion of the fracture inwards easily, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; using that, gently straighten it.
And if the jaw fracture is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension to both parts according to a straight line until its possible realignment.
And if you encounter any tooth damage or displacement, then firmly secure those you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; then place a compress on the fractured jaw, and then place folded cloth over that, and place a large, well-made bandage or a piece of linen matching the jaw's length over the cloth; and then bind that above it in the manner best suited to your method and application, until it is no longer loose.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and provide him with easily digestible, light meals.
And if you estimate that the shape has been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen it on the third day; and then straighten what has been altered and plaster it with ground powder, egg white, or fine flour, after you have removed the bandage and place a soft wool plaster on top.
Then, once this plaster is firmly attached and the bone's position is not further altered, leave it, do not remove it until the fracture is healed and firmly set; for often this fracture is set within three weeks.
And if a harmful abscess should occur again, then administer what we have repeatedly mentioned for its treatment until it is healed and the abscess has subsided.
And if the fracture is with a scab, then consider whether it's a detached piece of bone or splinters; then you must carefully remove those splinters with what is appropriate for their removal from the instruments.
And if the opening of the scab is narrow, then you should widen it with leeches, according to your needs.
And once you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains, then you should examine the opening of the scab, if it is wide; and if not, apply one of the suitable plasters to it, and allow it to heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
Often the collarbone is fractured in the part nearer to the muscle, and this fracture occurs in one of three ways.
When it is fractured, or separated, or separated into two parts, apart from splinters; and it is easy to restore; or it is such that splinters occur, and it is difficult to restore; or it is such that the fracture is with a scab.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a scab, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the support and steady the fractured collarbone, and the other extends the shoulder towards that part.
And then gently manipulate the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, as it should be, neither protruding too much nor concave.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, of a size appropriate to your needs; and extend and elevate the collarbone, and apply pressure to the pad with your hand until you align the fracture as required.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone ends outward, because they have become fixed in their position, then the patient should be placed on their back, and a cushion of moderate size should be placed over the muscle of their neck.
And the assistant should press on the muscle on either side beneath, until the collarbone is lifted from the position in which it is fixed, and then you should correct and manipulate the fracture with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone and they are loose, then you should divide the splinters and easily remove them.
And if it is lodged within the bone, then you should make an incision there with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this purpose, after you have placed under the collarbone the instrument that serves as a lever; and it is an instrument of wood or iron, of which this is its shape:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as possible for the operation; it should have two ends, like the letter "V", and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the rupture of the wound that you have incised when you have extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and you are certain of a suppurative inflammation, then you should close the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the rupture is small, or you fear a suppurative inflammation, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the extent of the wound's incision.
And if suppurative inflammation occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rubbed oil and wine, and place it on top.
And take care that the splint is not moved from over the broken bone.  Therefore, you should see the patient every day, and when you see the ligaments softened or the splint already loosened, then you should adjust it and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's head on a pillow, and put a small cushion under the patient's armpit beneath the pillow at night.  So that with this, the patient's arm is elevated away from the side, and therefore the fracture of the collarbone is elevated from the muscle; or the patient's arm is tied to the patient's neck.
Do not loosen the bandage if there is not inflammation or suppuration in the area for up to twelve days.
And then renew the plaster if you see the patient's condition allows, and adjust the splint and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and coagulated.
And it is tightened and comforted according to the month in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is fractured in the lateral part of it, and it is not broken through but only the edges.
And therefore, when the place of it is fractured – and it is fractured in the middle of it – and it is not known except by touching, then according to the appearance of the fracture, prepare it and return it to its natural shape using all possible engineering techniques.
Then place on the area powdered chalk mixed with egg white and stop it with linen; then place a folded cloth poultice; and then place a thin, flat wooden board over it, according to the size of the entire shoulder blade or a little more.
However, if underneath the board there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that hollow with linen, and then raise the board so it is level.
And then bind it tightly with a long strip of cloth, with appropriate constriction and firmness on the board, until it is held securely in place.
And check the bandage every day; and whenever it softens, bandage it again, and tighten and adjust the board if it has shifted from its position.
And let the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore, when this number of days is completed, then you loosen the bandage, and you will know for certain if the injury is of the bones, whose connection is not feared, nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the location of the heavy bone and place the splint under it, then you cut around it, remove it, and do as we have said in the treatment of a broken collarbone or abscess, should such occur here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of a fractured foot.
Sometimes the foot is fractured in the middle, and that heals late; but the extremities heal more quickly because they are jammed and crushed.
And the symptoms when it is fractured in the middle are that it declines towards the inside parts, and great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, strong fever and vomiting of blood occur; and the cavity in the broken bone is apparent, and not hidden from feeling.
And the restoration of it is that the patient be laid on their back, and a cushion be placed between their shoulders; and then press on the muscles, and adjust the bones with the hands on both sides, and be subtle in the operation and in the straightening according to every possible manner and that which is appropriate, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then place a poultice and bandage on it, and place a thin splint of willow or reed or similar lightness on top, then wrap it in cloth; and then gently bind that around the broken bone to prevent it from moving; and apply a bandage that is rounded on the back sometimes, and tighten it with appropriate tension; and then check the bandage constantly, and when it softens, tighten it further.
And if the need arises for loosening it due to festering, swelling, pain, or abscess that arises in the area, then you should loosen and remove it, and remove the poultice, and rectify what occurred with the appropriate treatment; then you should reapply the poultice, if necessary, and adjust the tightness until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Of the restoration of the ribs when they are fractured.
Know that fractures of the ribs occur only in the thick parts, that is, the middle; and the extremities of their edges (or ends) do not suffer bruising (or injury) because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the senses through investigation with the fingers.
And the restoration should be done by aligning the fracture with the fingers in the best possible way, until it is properly joined, and then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if needed.
And if the rib fracture is towards the inner parts, the patient suffers intense pain and stabbing, like the stabbing pain that occurs in pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood; and this is a difficult condition to cure.
And the ancients were ingenious in dealing with that.
And from what they said:  it is necessary to give the patient foods that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly is swollen and distended, and the fracture is pushed outward.
However, we should avoid this, as it is not a light cause to generate a hot abscess if it does not occur; and if it does occur, then it will help with that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on it and strongly drawn; and it seems reasonable, but nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass draws the superfluities to the area due to weakness.
And some of them said: the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is full, and the dressing should be applied around the affected area according to its shape; and then the patient should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through diet and medicine.
And if a violent cause afflicts the patient, who cannot endure it, and the bone pierces the membrane with a painful wound, we fear for the patient, then we must cut open the area, expose the broken rib, and then place an instrument on it to keep the shape, the memory of which has preceded, and cut the bone easily and remove it.
And then, if the wound is large, we should stitch together the two edges of the wound, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside, then you should mix powders in rubbed oil and apply it to the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie on his back on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of fractures of the spinal column of the back and neck.
Sometimes there are fractures in the bones of the neck, and there are also often injuries to them, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if you often find their muscles already softened, numb, dead, and you cannot move them, stretch them, or tighten them, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed, and in this state of things, it is fatal.
And if you move them and feel constriction with your fingers and pricking, then know that the bone's marrow is intact and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar signs to this on the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if it will heal or not, then examine the patient's feet.
Then, if you find them already softened, and notice the same symptoms as those in the muscles, and when they lie on their back, they experience involuntary windiness and urination, and sometimes they are lying on their back, wanting to urinate but unable to, then know that it is fatal, and do not attempt treatment.
But if you do not observe any of those symptoms, the cause is milder and easier to treat.
And the treatment for this is to apply a sedative poultice to the inflamed vertebra, either with oiled or roasted herbs, or with beaten egg whites; leave this on for a few days until the inflammation subsides.
And then apply a comforting and stimulating plaster, and bind it firmly; and instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not to sleep on the affected area until it heals.
And if you observe a separation of the bone, or any other cause that has already separated it, then it is necessary to dissect along the fracture line and remove that bone; then bring the two sides of the wound together, with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with a healing salve until healed.
But if the back of the bone is fractured, and it's the end of the shaft, then you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the anus, and realign the fractured bone with the other hand as much as possible by means of a second-stage reduction; then apply a plaster and bandage, if needed, and secure it.
And if you find fractured splinters there, then you should remove them and treat the wound with the previous treatment until healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the [broken] width [or breadth].
The bones of the hips are often fractured, and if they break, their fracture is only a separation at their extremities, and they are cut lengthwise and deflected inward;  the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it so that it is over the fracture which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you shall adjust it so that it is properly aligned until it is assembled into its natural shape.
But if the fracture is along the length or already inclines towards the lower parts, then you must have the patient lie on their stomach so that you are prepared to restore that fracture. And then, once you have adjusted it, place a poultice over it, and then place a splint of wood or bone over that, and bind tightly so that you need not fear puncturing the fracture or displacing the splint.
And adjust the hollow with that which fills it until it takes on the tightness according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their sound side.
But if a festering abscess occurs, then cease the extension and restoration until the festering abscess is soothed, and apply that which soothes it as is previously described; then resume the restoration, and bind it as is appropriate.
And if the bones are shattered or comminuted, then you must set them.
Chapter 11.
Of the restoration of the fractured adjunct.
Adjutori is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness in this manner:
And two ligaments are tied to its two ends, and it is then suspended from a raised location.
And the patient lies down on a bed; and then place the patient's broken arm over the wood until it reaches the point where the curve of the wood is attached to the middle of the area.
And then suspend something heavy on that, or the attendant extends it downwards; and then the doctor holds the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to its proper position.
The other method is that the patient is placed on their back and the hand of their neck is suspended with a bandage; and then command two attendants, one of whom holds what is above the fracture with their hands, and the other holds what is below it; and each of them pulls in their direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you bind the fracture with a bandage and another bandage over that, and each of the two attendants pulls in their respective directions.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the point and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, it is necessary that the bandage be placed over that area and around the elbow.
Apply that with ease and without trouble, and then, once it is bound properly and applied with good application, tighten it if there is no danger of a purulent abscess developing.
But if an abscess forms, then leave the tightening until the seventh day, and place on it wool soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil until the abscess subsides, and then you can tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a plaster over the fracture, then place a wrapping of clean cloth over the plaster; then adjust the arm against that support, and place their open hand over their own muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the support around the arm so that the arm is in the proper position, unless some cause from the broken bone prevents this.
And then use splints.
And you should place on the fracture the splint that is widest and strongest of the other splints; and place the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the break, with an addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the tightening method I described at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your tightening around the fracture site is more tight. And the longer the fracture, the less tightening there should be.
Therefore, adjust the positioning of the splints and the tightening as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do so.
And if you fear a deep abscess, then you leave the splint and the strapping in place for seven days, as we have said.
And now, consider the ligament in all its parts for three days so that no swelling or inflammation occurs at the site; or, because excess tightening prevents food from reaching the limb; therefore, correct all this according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that no cause for this will occur, then do not loosen the bandage until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands on their stomach.
And place a full, wool-lined poultice over the affected area, and be aware at all hours of the night or day that the fractured limb's shape is not weakened or loosened, or that the ligament is softened, and therefore rectify all of this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the previous order, so that the food is initially light until the swelling begins to subside; and then it is necessary to increase the food's strength.
For according to custom, the affected area and leg should be bandaged for 40 days; and then they should be loosened, and a bath should be given, and medicated with ointments that correct it.
And if the fracture is severe/complicated, then you should not loosen the ligament and bones from that injury for up to a month, or even up to two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones; of which one is small, and it is the one that sits by the said wrist, and the other is large and is the one located below the small wrist, on the lower part.
And often the larger forearm bone is broken alone, or the smaller one, and often both are broken together.
And when the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is more straightforward.
And when the forearm bone is broken below, the fracture is severe, and the healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the broken bone is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is appropriate for the physician, in restoring it, to apply a small extension with ease until it is healed.
But if the larger forearm bone is broken, then it is necessary to apply a more forceful extension.
And if both forearm bones are broken together, then it is necessary for you to apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you position the hand's figure for restoring it and extending it on a cushion, and let the palm of the hand be higher than all the other parts mentioned, and the little finger be lower than the other fingers, and let the patient be lying on a smooth bed.
And let a cushion be in front of him at his height or in line with him, so that the patient does not experience discomfort.
And then the attendant should extend the lower arm with their hand or bandage, and another attendant should extend the upper arm similarly.
And then the physician should manipulate the bone until it returns to the best possible position.
And if, in setting the bone, there are obstacles, then you must use your skill to return every piece to its proper place.
And if there appears a separated fragment that punctures the skin and is not to your satisfaction in restoring it, then you should operate on it and remove it according to the method mentioned above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter on this, and therefore take care of that.
And if you encounter a suppurating abscess at the beginning of your restoration, then you should line a cloth with a plaster made of roasted oil and white wax, and it should be in a mixture of subtlety and fineness, and tightly bind the cloth over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the plaster and apply a prepared poultice of powdered mold with egg white, and then place plasters; and let the plaster placed over the fracture be as wide and strong as possible.
And understand that the names of the plasters for the arm are found in the major arrangements, or that is, the fracture in one compartment or in two compartments together.
And then apply your binding to the fracture site as strongly and forcefully as possible, and the more the binding is applied to the upper parts of the fracture or the lower parts, apply the binding a little more loosely according to the remembrance of it at the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is bound should be of a medium thickness, between thin and thick, as we have recounted.
And consider the limb and its ligaments for some days. And if any cause arises for which correction is necessary, such as swelling occurring in the limb, then you must immerse the limb in warm water until the swelling ceases.
And leave the limb unbound until it rests, and then reapply the binding.
And if the binding has softened, and the bone is now realigned and resembles the others, then correct all of this with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, for then you must slightly loosen the binding and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not exhibit any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to loosen the binding for approximately 20 days or thereabouts.
And then, through their own efforts, the patient's hand should be suspended, and they should sleep on their side.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or very easily in 28 days, and all this depends on the disposition of the body's complexions and the strength of the body.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand's wrist and fingers.
Know that the wrist of the hand and the joints of the fingers are frequently fractured, and not only injured through blows but also often through friction.
And when the hand is injured by fracture or friction, then it is necessary for the patient to be lying down, and before him, a bandage is placed evenly, and then the patient's hand is placed on that bandage.
And then the attendant extends the broken bones, and the physician holds them until they are firmly joined together.
And then it is necessary to place a poultice and bandages, if not a boil occurs; and then a splint is placed over the affected area, and you have already wrapped it in linen.
But if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, and then make a sort of sling of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold that with their fractured palm; afterward, it should be bound with long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather with cloth on which it is raised, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and bind it as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a splint over it and another splint from the lower part into the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply a bandage, as if the hand is turned to the fingers by ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bound as necessary, and then it should be held with the palm, and if you wish, put a small straight splint on it, so that the fracture is raised and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the pinky finger, then it should be bound and tied with the finger that lies beside it; or all of them should be tied together in sequence, and that is better; or place a small splint on it, just as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and then after that, the arrangement of a cautious and opposing abscess—with your operation—with whatever is necessary when any of those causes occur, as the narrative of it is repeated.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fractured thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken, and is declared to be broken according to the part that is converted to the front and to the most superior part.
And the restoration of it is done so that the ligament is tightened over the fracture, and another ligament under the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and on their face.
And then the minister extends all the ligament to its proper part, according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be near the knee, in the direction of the hip joint, so that the extension is above it, and the other ligament under the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is near the knee, then the ligament should be near the knee, and the extension should be towards the lower parts.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is joined by a good connection; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, otherwise the affected limb will become infected. However, if it becomes infected, then you leave it for a few days until the infection subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this:  wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, folding it two or three times, removing any excess; then wrap the leg until you reach the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and the leg near the knee, and let the ends of the splint extend from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place splints over the thigh, at the location of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is consolidated.
And then start with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and as you move away from the fracture site, your bandage should be less tight, lighter, and softer.
And then extend the two ends of the splint downwards until they reach the ankle of the foot, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side to prevent the bandage from shifting out of place.
And then leave the bandage on, ensuring that no inflammation, abscess, or swelling or similar conditions affect the limb; and if any such problem arises, remove the bandage and correct what has happened immediately, as we have often said.
But if there is a piece of bone that has come loose, then you must reposition it as best as possible; and if not, cover it and leave it, and treat it with what preceded the remedy until it is healed.
And sometimes this thigh fracture is tightened with splints, just as we have said for the shoulder and arm.
However, in the restoration done in this way, the patient does not experience limping; and if it is restored alone, or if the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one who is always limping should do so.
And know that the thigh is bandaged for 40 days, or a little more, or a little less, and all this is according to the variety of constitutions and other conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fractured kneecap (or patella).
Know that a fracture of the kneecap often heals, but often results in a rubbing (or abrasion).
But if a fracture occurs, it is then only a crack or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a rupture, and concerning all this there has been a feeling (or sensation).
And the restoration of it is to bind together what is broken in its parts with bandages until it is joined and conjoined as much as possible by means of equability (or evenness), ease, and construction.
And then apply a plaster and place it over the affected area, if needed; and bind it firmly with suitable bandages.
And now consider all the methods we have described for other fractures, similarly to how an abscess is treated and similarly to how one would oppose any accident with what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the femur; and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
And the treatment for any type of fracture of these two leg bones is similar to the treatment for fractures of the arm, and therefore the restoration is also the same, and the operation for it is one and the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is displaced in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is displaced anteriorly (or forward).
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it underneath, and that is amongst the things not hidden from you.
And then administer extension, reduction, and bandaging of the splints accordingly.
However, if the fracture of the leg is extensive with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and ease it with your skill.
And if there is any need for an operation on the arm in conjunction with the leg, and when you have aligned the splints and completed your operation on the leg, then you will take wooden splints (or boards) placed under the supporting structures, which are made from palm branches; take ones with a smaller diameter, and do not use any that are too thick, and make them the length of the leg, from the knee down to just below the ankle.
And then wrap each splint in two layers of cloth according to its length, placing one over the leg on one side and the other on the opposite side, and they should extend from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle.  By this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a splint has been administered, corresponding to the length of the leg; and the leg should be supported so that it retains its position.
And this is especially necessary in cases of fracture, and when the bone is broken properly.
And from then on, examine the leg daily and study it thoroughly, and watch for abscesses, inflammations, or other similar issues.  If any such problem arises, apply the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the heel bone, and the bones of the foot and toes.
Fractures of the heel bone do not occur frequently, but fractures of the foot bones do happen sometimes; and the toes of the foot rarely fracture, instead often only showing friction or abrasion damage in their usual positions.
And if the bones of the foot do fracture, and those bones are displaced from their proper positions, then the patient should place their foot on the ground in a way that is carefully aligned like when walking.
And then place one foot on something that supports the displaced bones, and then press and press down on them, and compress them until they return to their proper positions.
Then apply a plaster or bandage on top, and place a small board with two flat ends underneath the sole of the foot.
And then firmly bind that with a downward-pulling bandage, after you have wrapped it in cloths and other materials as needed.
And when three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandages, for you will find the bones either compressed, or broken, or dislocated, and the treatment in those cases is as you know it.
But if some bones are broken, then repair them, and compress them in the same way as I have described and recounted to you in the repair of fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and slightly wider than it; and then place the board underneath the foot, as previously described, and bind it with a downward-pulling bandage.
But if the broken bones are two, three, or more, then place splints of appropriate size, wrapped in linen, on each finger; and bind the board to the lowest part of the foot, and have one end of the board extending above the patient's belly, so that it holds it firmly in place.
And it is important for you not to forget that you should consider all the causes I have mentioned in the other fractures and accidents we have discussed; and be prepared for every accident with what is necessary.
Chapter 18.
Of fractures of the thigh bone, the hip bone, and the penis in men.
When the thigh bone is fractured, then place that leg in a well-fitted splint, and gently incline it towards the back a little, and it should be held behind.
And then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be fitted to the thigh in such a way as to support it; then the woman should be kept still, and slowly raise her back, as this should be done carefully until the fractured part of the thigh is aligned and the broken bone returns to its place.
And then place cushions under her back, and when she wants to urinate, she will remove the wool easily, and then she urinates; then you reduce and return it in the way that you put it in place at the beginning, and then return it to its original cushion.
And do this for seven days or so, until it is healed.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and fit a reed tube over the wound; and place the entire bladder inside the thigh, and then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated inside the thigh, for this will help the fracture to return to its proper position.
And then fill it with wool and leave it for several days, as we have described, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and setting what we have described for the hip bone.
And what is correct is not hidden in these nearby and less severe fractures, especially for those who study and use and understand my words in this book; for this fracture signifies the best methods for restoring and healing it, and thus understand well.
However, when a man's penis is broken, take a bandage of wool and place it on the penis; then place a wrapping of cloth over it, and let it remain wrapped for three days or so, and it will heal.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of the bones when affected by plague.
It is advantageous for the one who suffers a fracture affected by plague, and especially if the bone is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the upper arm, or similar to those, that you should bleed and leeches him/her immediately if the conditions for bloodletting permit or indicate as we have said above.
And if the plague causes the outflow of blood, then you must apply a styptic to it, in such a way that you powder it with crushed zegi, if no other remedy is available.
And then begin restoring the fracture on the same day, and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a serious abscess occurs, then you should delay the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days, for you will cause harmful accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the uncovered skin, then you must carefully reduce and hold it in place with your hands with ease and little stretching.
However, if your hands are not prepared for the stretching and repositioning of the bone, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight digits, and its width according to the size of the injury.  Therefore, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, depending on the amount needed for treatment of any kind of fracture.
And it should be round, and of little thickness, so that it is not bent by the pressure on it during the operation.
And it should have sharp edges at its ends; and the top should be thick, tapering to half its size towards the ends.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", which means a small spatula.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sharp end be placed elevated on the prominent bone end.
And you push it in one go until the bone returns, and it is aligned with some sort of equality/evenness.
And thus, strive to align the fractured ends, and if the fractured end is delicate and does not accept the instrument properly, then it is necessary that you incise the end of that bone until the instrument has sufficient purchase.
But if you cannot fully reduce the bone with what we have recounted, then you should cut it with the appropriate instruments for cutting, which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible.
And then remove whatever rough edges and small fragments remain on the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient experiences intense pain, then know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and then do what you deem to be of great benefit to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then immerse a cloth in black astringent wine, and if it is summer, specifically, do not put a plaster or any other oily substance on the wound, so that it does not cause festering and corruption.
And after administering remedies at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, leave the wound uncovered, and cut the wound with scissors, and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be extremely careful not to squeeze the wound against the fracture, for many times foolish doctors have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or debilitating illness upon their patients, which is to say, gangrene. And if your (treatment) is light, gentle, different from the treatment of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear some of the bad accidents we have described, and you find pain in the area, then it is not appropriate to put plasters there, but rather make a bandage of hard cloths instead of plasters, and bind it tightly with those.
And after about a day or two, once the wound begins to fester, if pus is generated there, then you remove the cloth you had placed over it with wine, and then apply some ointments, with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage and consider the wound every day morning and evening until it is healed and closed, and it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus runs from it to the lower parts with ease.
If the wound has passed many days, and it is not healed nor is the pus separated from it, then know that there are signs of complications here, for which you must probe the wound with a probe. And of those signs, those that are separated remain and are extracted; those that are not separated and cause pain in the limb, force you to cut them if possible.
And if the wound acquires a discharge or a swelling, i.e., symptoms, or another type of corruption or putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply to each of those what is appropriate for its cure, which is preceded by a description in its chapter.
And regarding this, where my sermon should end and you should present your skill: when a bone is broken, treat the limb as you would the thigh bone and similar to those of the larger limbs, and do not attempt to pull or remove it, for often death results; leave it until it sets, for it will likely set on its own after about 20 or 30 days. Then treat the wound, if you see fit, and if it doesn't set, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of swelling that occurs in the area of any fracture.
Often this swelling occurs in the area of healing from a fracture, especially if it's near the joints, and it disfigures the limb's shape; and it severely impedes the limb's natural function.
Therefore, consider if the swelling is recent and apply medicines that are astringent, such as alum, vinegar, myrrh, and ceruss and similar ones;  take some or all of them, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply that mixture to the swelling on a cloth, and tightly bind it.
And leave that bandage firmly in place for several days; and then remove it and apply another, until the swelling is gone; or bind a lead plate on top of the swelling, as lead has the property of reducing swelling in the limbs.
However, if the swelling has already hardened and become tight and needs to be removed forcefully, then cut it at the most prominent part, and remove the excess and protruding part, or cut it with certain rasps until it's removed; and treat the area until it heals.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is healed, and afterwards the limb remains weak and frail, this is often due to several causes: one being the excessive loosening or incorrect binding of the ligaments; or an excessive tightness of the ligaments that prevents nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive use of poultices; or excessive movement at the wrong time; or a lack of blood in the patient's body and their general weakness.
And the treatment for this is to give the patient food and make their body soft until blood is replenished; and administer baths; and introduce joy and happiness to them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water compresses, until the nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural shape.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of broken bones when they are repaired crookedly and the correct procedure is not followed.
When you see the restored limb displaying crookedness, prominence in the fractured bone, and a lump, and this is therefore a deformity of the limb, but nonetheless the limb is not prohibited from its natural function, then you should not accept the word of someone who claims that the limb is now newly broken.
But many foolish physicians and bone-setters have done this in our land; and this procedure is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
However, if the limping and lumping are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which softened herbs are steeped, such as mallow leaves and its roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and apply a softening poultice, like a well-made diachylon; or prepare a mucilage from mallow root and mix it with henbane juice or beeswax oil, and apply that; or use ripe figs, crush them with pigeon droppings, and similar medicines that are known to promote healing.
And sometimes it is resolved with diligent, gentle rubbing with moist hands, and movement of the limb should be administered in all directions at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become strong, hardened, and difficult to cure, then it is necessary to stop the pus and dissolve the continuation of the bone, and carefully cut away the excess swelling around the bone with sharp instruments.  Careful and diligent treatment should be administered.
Chapter 23.
Concerning (or, On) Dislocations.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place, preventing movement, deforming the limb, and causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when an accident causes a dislocation, it is essential to quickly try to relocate it, and do not delay its reduction, for if delayed, the area becomes inflamed and hardened, making the dislocation difficult to reduce.
And therefore, it is not appropriate to manipulate or stretch during the inflammatory stage, for often it causes spasms and worsening pain.
But when this happens, you should resort to bloodletting the patient, and leave it until the inflammation subsides; then, the limb should be soaked in warm water and oil, and then reduced with ease.
And every limb is treated in this way, so that the memory of the joint returns to its place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, following the procedure for fractures; from the highest part of the body down to the lowest.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, quickly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are displaced from their places by a slight movement, and slightly softened; or they are completely and fully dislocated, until they are softened at the joint, to the point that the patient is drooling, and cannot keep it, or cannot close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped up in his mouth.
However, when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete and full, then a gentle reduction must be administered, and it must not be delayed at all.
And the assistant should hold the patient's head, and the doctor should insert the tip of one hand into the dislocated jaw's socket inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he should insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on two sides, and the other fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he should hold; and he should command the patient to stop the movement of his jaws and to disengage them from each side; and the doctor should pull and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And thus, when they return and are held together, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place over them poultices of cloth with cerate, and it should be made of wax and rubbed oil; and then it should be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two pillows, so that it does not turn to the right or left side; and do not force him to chew anything; let their food be soft and easily digestible until the pains have subsided and the jaws are healed, then let him eat what he wants.
And this should be administered with ease, and do not trouble opening the mouth for eating, drinking, or breathing until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often fever and persistent sweating occur, and the patient's stomach is quite easily upset, and there is much vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and often the one who experiences this dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated from within the chest by its connection to the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is apparent to the senses.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then tightly compress the area with your palm, for it will return.
And then apply a poultice and powders to that area and compress it.
However, the extremity that is connected to the elbow and continues from there, is not dislocated in any way; therefore, it should be reduced and healed according to what we have said and as you are equipped to do.
And then apply a poultice, powders, and bandages, and command the patient to adhere to quietness and rest until healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated in the upward and downward direction.
And the second is that it is dislocated in the part above the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated to the parts behind by the shoulder, and it is not dislocated to the parts in front by the nerves.
And most often it is dislocated and comes out to the lower parts towards the neck, and most often in those whose flesh is thin, it is easily dislocated, but in those whose flesh is thick, it is difficult to push out.
And often, accidents befall some men through blows or falls, and the muscle of the sufferer is swollen with a hot abscess, and it is thus believed to be dislocated.
Therefore, you must test this until you are quite certain of it, and then you proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts towards the neck, so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find a hollow at the head of the muscle and below the neck near the touch of the head of the muscle, just like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor move it with any movement.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a clear point of contact, and it is not hidden.
And a slight reduction of this dislocation is made when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the attendant raises the patient's hand to the upper parts; and then places your fingers below the patient's neck, and lifts the joint with strength back to its place, and the attendant raises the patient's hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it down because it returns easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a long time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient should be bathed in warm water and given an application that softens and smoothes, like if it were a mixture of the roots of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and this should be administered.
Then the patient should be laid on their back, and under the neck a wool pad should be placed, with a degree of looseness and firmness, and then the physician places their heel on the pad, and lifts the muscle head with force, and pulls the patient's hand so that it is not pulled downwards, and another attendant holds the patient's head so that it is not pulled downwards, because the joint will promptly return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: have a man present who is taller than the patient, and stand on the opposite side, and put his muscle under the patient's neck and lift the patient's neck upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another attendant pulls the patient's hand from the lower parts of their body. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down, because the dislocation returns quickly.
And it is easily reduced by another method: a long post is placed in the ground, its top rounded like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, and placed under the patient; then lions' cloths are placed on top of the post's head, and the patient stands along the length of the post, and then the patient's hand is extended downward, and the body is pulled outward with force, because the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a post whose length is two arms' length and whose width is four fingers, and its thickness should be suitable for the neck in this way:
And then lions' cloths should be tied to the rounded head so that the post does not injure the patient.
And then, a support is placed under the patient's armpit, and the hand or arm is extended along the post to the lower parts, and the post is tied to the support and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a ladder rung according to its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the other body part is suspended from the other side, so that the joint quickly enters its proper place.
And when the repositioning is complete according to any method possible for you, then you should place under the armpit a wool pad of sufficient quantity; then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder with honey and egg white over the entire muscle, thus covering it, and then compress under the armpit with a suitable bandage; and the bandage should be wound over the plaster, and the patient's hand should be attached to the neck, and left still, and the hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's food be limited until the limb is strengthened, because this is more conducive to their recovery.
And then, the diet should be increased gradually to seven or five portions, and some movement should be encouraged.  Thus, if it is firm and not softened, then it is already healed.
But if the joint is dislocated frequently due to moisture that affects it or another cause, then in that case a cautery with three openings should be administered, as is previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and bandage are repositioned several times, and it is still not firm, and the arm cannot be raised above, then understand that the nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are now cut, extended, or softened, and know that the joint will never return to its proper place.
For dislocations occurring near the foot and the nipple or the back parts, reduction is accomplished by pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns to its place.
And another bandage should be applied to that area, and treat it until it is healed.
And if after healing, there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until that heaviness is relieved and the limb returns to its original condition.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and equally difficult to return to its proper position; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so towards the front than the back.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is apparent under observation or touch, whatever the specific configuration of the dislocation.  And when you align the dislocated elbow with its proper position, this is clearly revealed to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor can the arm touch its own muscle.
And you should act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes a deep-seated abscess, for if it becomes a deep-seated abscess, the reduction is difficult, and the limb is not entirely healed; and more so when it is located in the back areas, for it is the worst of all other types of dislocations, and causes the most pain, and often leads to death.
And the restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's hand is extended with two hands, and the arm is outstretched, and the physician's hands are on the elbow above and below it, and the physician pushes the joint with the tips of their fingers together, or with the heel of their palm, until it returns to its proper place.
But if the dislocation is towards the front, then it is returned by bending the arm with their hand, until the physician strikes the elbow with the heel of their hand.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a forceful extension, very strong.
And it is necessary that two assistants extend the arm, and hold that extension so that it does not revert to its previous position during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, since it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over their hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with their hand, anoint it with some oil, so that this lubricates the joint and makes it easier; and then push the joint with a forceful impulse until it returns to its proper place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that it be placed on a poultice in which there is astringency and a binding effect, using egg white, and be bandaged tightly downward, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and left for several days.
And then it should be untied; and therefore, if the joint is formed in its proper place, then you loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see that the joint is not properly tightened, then you reapply the poultice and bandage, and leave it for several days until it is tightened; and then untie it.
But if there is a serious complication after the joint reduction, and the patient's condition is unstable, then apply moist heat, gentle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or place on the joint a soothing, fatty substance; and then bandage it, and leave it on the affected bone day and night. And then remove the bandage, and put it in a bath; and when it is soaked, then you rub the joint with gentle friction, and then reapply a soothing substance, such as a fatty ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the use of baths, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place on that wound a warm, moist cow's hide, and press firmly upon it; and do this several times, because that is moist and will restore it to its proper condition.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of dislocations of the shoulder, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
Dislocations of the hand sometimes occur, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy, and the opposite is true for other joints.  However, speed is needed in the reduction at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes inflamed or a suppurative inflammation develops.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the hand's joint of the patient on a table, and the attendant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or palm over the eminence of the joint, and pushes until it returns to its place.
However, it is important to consider if the palm has already been moved to the back of the hand; in that case, the patient places the back of his hand on a table during the extension and reduction.  If the dislocation is prior to the back of the hand, then the patient's hand should be positioned on the table intrinsically, so that the physician's hand can be placed over the eminence of the joint.
And if it returns quickly, that is good.  But if not, then hold it with a bandage, avoiding inflammation, and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise neither will it endure nor will you succeed in the reduction after days have passed.
However, if the joint remains in its deformity, and you find no cause for the patient's pain, but only that the hand is weakened and cannot grip anything, then know that the nerves are severed or crushed.  In such a case, there is no remedy but to cauterize around the injured area, and firmly apply a bandage.  This will provide some relief.
Therefore, once the injury has been reduced, apply the bandage we have described, and leave it on and secured for five days.  Then, remove the bandage and allow the patient to exercise their hand.
But if the patient's movement is restricted and you notice any heaviness, then alleviate it with warm water and gentle friction several times until relief is achieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various ways.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated towards the palm side or the back of the hand, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your fingers, until it returns to its place.
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend it over the part to which it was dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is properly set in its place.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not stop loosening it during the day and exercising it with movements, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is straight.
And do the same if it is dislocated towards the back of the hand, and bind it to that part and do your first procedure on it, until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and the vertebrae are completely displaced from their positions, then in that case there is no cure, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's bowel movements are involuntary and they cannot retain them; and often some of their limbs, or two legs or two arms, or one of them, become numb; or a vertebra is displaced, because often they are displaced and often the displacement of these occurs in four directions.
Therefore, this has already moved to the posterior parts and is called a sprain.
But the treatment for this is that you must consider if the sprain occurred due to a fall, because in that case there is no cure, nor is it completely healed.
But in those cases that arise from accidents or blows or similar events, the ancients described detailed methods of treatment, from which the most beneficial is returned; however, I have reduced this subject, and I have omitted the unnecessary detail, due to my proximity to your understanding and my exposition.  I have presented this, formed from various sources, through which I will demonstrate and expand upon it.
And of those, only the one that occurs on the back, properly speaking, is curable with what I am recommending.
And it is that the patient be laid on their face, propped up against a wall, and be supported underneath with a soft instrument so that the patient's foot is not bruised.
And then a straight pole should be placed, driven into the ground at the end of the prop near the patient's head, and another pole should be placed under the patient's feet at the other end of the prop.
And one attendant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in the ground; and another attendant should hold the other pole in the same way.
And then wrap around the patient's head and under the temples a strong, firm bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole positioned by the head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around the patient's hips, and around the legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole that is next to the patient's feet.
And then each attendant should extend the bandage to the part of the pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be moved from their places where they are placed, but nevertheless, they should not be fixed as we have said.
And the physician places their palms on the spine with force until it returns, or places a table on it, and then they have the patient place their feet on the table until it returns.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a table whose width or length is roughly three arms' lengths, and hollow out a space in the wall, which we mentioned is near the patient, into which the end of the table fits. And then place half of the table on the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open with a turning tool that is turned by hand; and that you place on the ground at the head of the patient, two poles, the length of each being one arm's length, and at the patient's feet, likewise, two poles. And the length between each pole is one palm's breadth.  A hole has been made in each pole for the turning tool to fit into, and each is firmly anchored to the ground so that it does not move.
And place a round pole on which the turning tool is placed, and turn it in the two holes of the two poles.
And at the end of that [round pole] is a hole into which the [round] pole is fitted, its length being one palm's width,  [and connected to that rotating shaft]; and in the other two poles, there is something similar to this.
And now tighten the ligatures you have tied around the patient's feet at the hole that is towards the patient's head, and the ligatures you have tied around the patient's thighs at the turning tool that is towards the patient's feet.
And now, next to each turning tool, a helper/attendant will turn the tool with their hand, while the physician adjusts the vertebra as we have described.
And once the vertebra has been repositioned and the area is adjusted, you should then apply a thick poultice with egg white, and then a bandage; then place a table-like splint (or board) on the poultice, whose width is roughly three fingers, and whose length is sufficient to cover the affected area of the vertebra.
And then it should be bound with the bandage we mentioned, and the patient should use light nourishment until he/she is healed.
And if any lingering inflammation remains at the end of healing, then medicines that soften and cleanse with table administration (as we have described) need to be administered for a long time.  And a lead plate should be applied to that area.
Sometimes inflammation occurs in the back vertebrae, caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which is now inflamed, so you should not attempt a remedy with this medicine, because it will cause your death.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint can only be dislocated, and that the things that happen to other joints of slight displacement and concavity do not happen to these.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is most often dislocated inwards, and less often forwards or backwards.
A sign of a dislocation inwards is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin.  The area where the groin is inflamed and painful is an abscess, because the head of the thigh bone has become stuck there.
The sign of a dislocation outwards is that the symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
A sign of a dislocation forward is that the patient can extend their leg fully, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if they try to move it forward, they cannot;  their urine is retained, and their groin is inflamed and painful, and they walk on the toes.
A sign of a dislocation backward is that the patient cannot extend their knee, nor can they bend it forward towards the groin; the affected leg is shorter than the other, the groin is swollen, and the head of the thigh bone is towards that area.
But the reduction of these types of dislocations is that you must consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, as it has been fixed with the passage of time. If you attempt a reduction, it will remain in its position, and is not fully cured. Therefore, no presumption should be made of complete success in that case.
However, in the case of a recent dislocation, one of the four types, then you must try to reposition the joint, extending it forward and backward, and to the right and left, for if it easily returns, then no further treatment is needed.
But if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either with their own hands or with a bandage tied above the knee; another assistant should hold the patient's hands below their hips;  and then another assistant should apply a strong bandage around the thigh, and a third assistant should hold the end of the bandage.
And the extension should be done either from the inside towards the groin, or from the back towards the buttocks.
And perform the extension in all those ways until the patient is lifted from the ground and hangs suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four types.
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type to proceed to the specific treatment.
In the proper reduction of a dislocation, when the dislocation is inward, the patient should be placed on their right side.  Then, place bandages around the root of the thigh, in the area between the head of the thigh and the area below the groin.  Then, extend the bandage from above the groin to the highest point of the pubic bone.
And then another strong attendant should take the patient's arms, and firmly grasp the affected thigh and extend it outward with forceful extension, for this will return it to its proper place.
And this type is easier to treat, with this limb being more easily reduced than the other types.
But if you are excused and do not obey the entire treatment with this type of cure, then it is necessary to tie the patient's two feet together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both heels.
And the length of each should be about four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by about two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended over the top of a wooden post, and in a room; and their distance from the ground should be about two arm lengths.
And then order a strong young man to grasp the upper thigh, and let another young man suspend the patient, while the first young man, pressing the thigh with strength, will cause the joint to return to its place quickly.
However, in the proper reduction, when the dislocation is outward, the patient should lie on a pillow, as we have previously recounted when setting the knee; and the bandage should be tight around the affected leg and foot.
And then two poles should be placed, one at their feet, and the other at their head; and then poles fitting the middle of the hill on which damp cloths are wrapped should be placed, so that the patient is not harmed by the pole being between their thighs, so that during the extension towards the lower parts, it is not pulled.
And then each attendant should extend on their respective side, and the physician with their hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be slightly extended, and it is according to this same narrative on the hill; and the physician places the palm of their right hand on the patient's shin, and then grasps it with the other hand, and with this grasping, holds it extended downwards towards the front of the joint.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, and they are raised from the ground; it is necessary that they be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the lifting if their hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about the patient's positioning on two surfaces; and it is on their side, and their ligaments are extended, as we have said, not much.
And it is necessary that pressure be applied with a board over the area where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be—and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see them equal and the patient holds their leg and extends it without excuse, then know that the limb has been returned as required—and then you join the two thighs and place a bandage and bind them so that the hip is not moved in any part; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then loosen the bandage and the splint, and compare one leg to the other.
Now, if you see them equal in appearance, then know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause of softening, then you return and bandage that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
And then loosen that, and have him/her walk slowly for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, but not forward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that if you ask the patient to bring their leg up to their thigh, then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these ways is that you should lay the patient down straight, so that if they can, they extend their leg; then place your own thigh against theirs, and place their foot between your feet; then carefully hold the knee with your palms, pressing your fingers into the knee with strength, and another assistant extends their foot so that the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that their leg adheres to the thigh with a light, effortless movement.
And then bandage that and bind the leg to the thigh with a bandage for three or four days, then remove the bandage.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days, until they are healed and strong.
But if reduction by you is unnecessary, then administer strong stretching with the bandages that were previously described in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle is sometimes dislocated by a small movement, and sometimes dislocated by force, and the dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that the ankle often swells on the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of the slight displacement is a gentle repositioning, and that it be extended with ease with the hands and be held until it returns to place.
But in the treatment of it when it is dislocated by force, it is necessary that you make the patient lie straight, and that one strong and capable attendant hold the affected area behind the two of them in the middle of it.
And then you, with your right hand, take hold of the foot at the highest point, and with your left hand the part of the foot just below the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left twice, and then extend with the left; and push the foot's heel with the right toward the leg without exertion.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the foot's heel against the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
So if it returns in one or two attempts following this method, and if you see the foot is straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation, for that return.
But if you are unable to reduce it with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place a thick cloth on the ground, and place it between the patient's thighs, and you have already draped a cloth over the patient so that it does not hurt the patient.
And then the attendant holds the patient's thighs, and another attendant extends the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the foot's ankle; and each attendant should extend opposite the other's extension, and the cloth should be stretched between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that the patient's body is not pulled down by their extension.
And then the physician straightens the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh at the lower extremities, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And therefore, when the dislocation returns and you are sure the reduction is successful, then apply a poultice and bind it tightly with bandages, and tie the foot to the leg with bandages.
And you should be careful or guard against the nerves that are located behind the heel, so that the bandage on it is not too tight and hurts it severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage has loosened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and prohibit the patient from movement for 40 days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be dislodged and corrupted, and therefore it will not receive a cure.
And if a boil/abscess arises, then you should apply to it, in accordance with what was previously mentioned in our narrative, another form of treatment and application, until it is resolved.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers and toes.
The dislocated joint needs to be gently manipulated without excessive force; this is not difficult, but rather easy.
However, if the dislocation is in one of the toes of the foot, then you should have the patient place their foot on a soft, even surface, like the ground or a table, and remain in that position as if walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot on the area that seems to have the dislocation.  Then, gently press down with your foot until you see it return to its proper place, and the protrusion no longer appears.
Then place a board under the sole of the foot, extending to cover the entire foot, with two supports.  Secure it firmly and properly for three days, and then release the board and keep the patient from walking for several days, until the joint is strong and the return to normal use is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations that are caused by blows, or fractures, or both together.
When any of those causes occur, and you exert yourself excessively in the treatment and restoration of the patient, often death results.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat such a condition, but only those skilled in the art, with long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash nor presumptuous; and who, at the beginning, use only medicines that reduce feverish abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except for those in whom there is hope of recovery, with alleviation of the illness, and where there appears any prospect of recovery. Then strive to perform the reduction immediately at the beginning of the condition, before it becomes a feverish abscess.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that reduces feverish abscesses and treats the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.
And if a dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must treat their separation, and do in this regard what we have said in simple ailments regarding the treatment of similar conditions.
And, according to your ability, avoid that which is harmful in the paths of fear, just as my teaching precedes you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more beneficial to your true self in your time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
