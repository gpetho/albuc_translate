 CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT.
On the loosening of the skin of the scrotum.
 In some men there often occurs a loosening of the skin of the scrotum without any loosening of the organs within.
This has a horrible appearance.
He who desires to treat this condition should make the patient lie on his back; and he should cut away all the loose skin that is over and above the normal.
Then he should bring together the two edges of the incision with a suture.
Or, if you prefer, first suture the excess of loose skin together, with three or four stitches, and make the suture firm.
Then cut away what is taken up between the stitches.
Then dress the wound with the usual dressings till it heals and the stitches come away.
