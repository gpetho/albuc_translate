Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
Rarely do the two jaws dislocate, except in rare cases, and their dislocation is in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their positions so that they relax a little, or they are completely and totally dislocated so that they relax.
Toward the chest until the patient's saliva flows and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech.  But if the dislocation is slight, it often returns by itself with the slightest effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, you should quickly reduce it and not delay it at all.  This is done by having an assistant hold the patient's head and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth, if the jaw is on one side.
Or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is on both sides, and the rest of the fingers of his hands from the outside, he adjusts with them, and orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go in every direction, and the physician adjusts the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved, then use a compress with hot water and oil until it is easy to reduce them, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we have said. When they return and are aligned and the patient's mouth is closed and they do not relax, then place bandages of cloth on them with cerate made of wax and rose oil.
Then tie gently with a loose bandage, and the patient should sleep on his back and his head elevated between two pillows so that he does not move it right or left and does not try to chew anything, but rather makes his food a soft broth.
So when the pain is gone and the jaw is set, let him eat what he wants, and let him do so gently and not force open his mouth when eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some point and do not return to their places, fevers and constant headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's bowels will loosen, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile repeatedly. If you see this, know that it is corrupted.
And often one who experiences this dies within ten days.
