On the method of cauterizing for cases of memory loss.
Chapter IX.
To begin, the patient should be given a drink containing potent hyeerae and pills that purify the brain.
Then, shave the patient's entire head and apply a mustard plaster over the occiput, as described in the chapter on plasters, and repeat this application several times.
This serves as a form of cautery, and perform it according to the sequence described in that section.
If the patient is healed by this, it is well.
If not, then make three cauteries on the back of the head, extending from the top of the head down to the lower part of the eye, spacing each cautery a fingerâ€™s width apart.
Then treat the cauteries as previously instructed.
If you want to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, then make an additional cautery in the middle.
If further treatment is desired, then cauterize over the two horns of the head.
Then treat the patient until he is healed, using the olive-shaped cautery as previously described.
