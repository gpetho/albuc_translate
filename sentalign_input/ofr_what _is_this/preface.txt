Oh, my very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine, along with its completion, and have made the end through its expositions and its declarations. 
And it came to me in a vision that I complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery".
And because the work of hands is neglected in our region and is completely foreign, the science is lost and fragmented, and there remains nothing of it except the short descriptions in the books of the ancients which hands have copied.
And from this has come error and vanity, and understanding is obscured and knowledge is driven away.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it with the organization of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will include with it the forms of cautery irons, and of other instruments of the work with the addition of the description and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And because no good master of hands is found in our time, the art of medicine is diminished.
And whoever undertakes it must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen said, so much that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and arms and their number, and the movement of the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And therefore Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable about the things mentioned above, let him beware that he does not fall into error and that he does not kill people; so that I have often seen many of those who meddle in this science and thus abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience. 
For I saw a foolish doctor who cut into a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who extracted a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; he took with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called there to extract it, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew well that if he were cut he would die from it.
And I saw another doctor who took into his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound; and the doctor, full of ignorance, tightened the break over the wound with splints by strong binding, and left no opening at all for the wound, and left it like that for a while; and he ordered him not to untie it; and it remained like that until the leg was completely swollen and the foot as well, and it came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But all the same the infection was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it; and the infection did not stop spreading through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another doctor who lanced a festering abscess, and then it became inflamed through the incompetence of his treatment.
For a canker, when it is full of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that all that is corrupted can be removed.
And therefore, dear son, you need to know that manual work is divided into two parts: namely, work where there is danger in many forms; and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you protect yourself, so that foolish doctors cannot speak ill of you. So take up your tools with reason, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you achieve a successful outcome and are praised; and leave the dreadful diseases of difficult healing; and remove your tools from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you can go from this world to the next with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonishments: "Do not undertake to treat a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish doctor.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about fire cauteries and sharp medicinal cauteries, and the chapter is organized from the head down to the feet; and about the forms of the instruments, and the cautery irons, and everything that is necessary for the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and cupping glasses and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things; and the chapter is organized with the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things; and it is organized from the head down to the feet, and with the forms of the instruments.
