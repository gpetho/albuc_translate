of hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when hemorrhoids are old they become bluish/livid;
and we have already discussed in the division their characteristics and symptoms, and I will discuss here those that can be treated.
I say that hemorrhoids and livid swellings, when they are deep in the marrow, and they are not perceptible to the touch, should not be treated with iron (a surgical instrument).
Those that are at the mouth of the anus, that can be felt, are the ones that can be treated.
You must then place the woman in a cold room, then grasp the hemorrhoid with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines to stop the bleeding, such as acacia and dragon's blood and frankincense, and similar things; 
then have her put her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if bleeding occurs, have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peel and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice of it on her back.
And if it stops, that's good.
If not, apply cupping glasses to her back and breasts without scarification;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or wild rose juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and the one that is called "albathir" is red, and is similar to a rough head, it must be cut like I described for the thelul;
and then treat it until it is healed.
