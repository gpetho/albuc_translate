Chapter forty-five, on fissuring in different kinds of goods/commodities.	CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE. On incision for various kinds of cyst.	0.6983754
Merchandise has many types, and I have mentioned all of its types in the classification.	There are various kinds of cyst. We have already mentioned all their varieties in the proper place.	0.611232
And it is necessary that we explain here the difference between merchandise and abscess, as it is problematic.	But we need here to set forth the difference between a cyst and an abscess, for it is complicated.	0.73619276
So I say that with an abscess there is heat, fever, and frightening pains until the boiling of the excess subsides and the putrefaction is complete, at which point the fever and the acuteness subside.	The abscess will be accompanied by heat and fever and fearsome pain, until the boiling-up of the superfluous matter settles down and the suppurating process is completed: then will the fever and intensity subside.	0.7210336
With merchandise, there is neither heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it is contained in a peritoneal sac that is its special container, and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a duck, and bigger and smaller, and it is of two types, either fatty or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification.	But with a cyst there is neither heat nor fever nor pains, and a membranous capsule encloses it, its own particular covering. The cyst is flesh-coloured, and it begins like a pea and becomes like a melon, more or less; and is of two kinds: either fatty or containing humidity; and the colours of the humidities are several, as we mentioned in the appropriate section.	0.76406217
So, when you come to treat merchandise, it is appropriate to probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, as its image comes in the chapter after this.	When you come to treat the cyst, you should first sound it and examine it with the instrument called the explorer, which is figured in the next chapter.	0.7141435
The method for examining all tumors and merchandise is that you take this instrument and insert it in the softest place you find in the tumor while you rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin, then press your hand according to the size of the tumor.	The way to examine all tumours and cysts is to take this instrument and press it in at the spot where the tumour is softest, and revolve it gently with your fingers till you know you have pierced the skin; then press it in proportionately to the size of the tumour.	0.9296532
Then take out the probe and look at what comes out after it. If flowing moisture comes out, whatever color it may be, then incise it with a simple incision as I mentioned in other tumors. And if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty, so incise it with a hardened incision in this way, as I have taught you.	Then remove the explorer and see what comes out after it. If a humidity should flow, whatever the colour, make a simple incision, as I said for the other tumours. But if no humidity come out along the track of the explorer you know at once that it is fatty.	0.88999104
And hang it with hooks, and skin the skin from each side gently, and preserve the sac if you are able to remove it intact with the merchandise.	Therefore make a cruciform incision upon it in this shape, as I have told you, and attach hooks and dissect away the skin gently from all sides. Be careful with the capsule; if you can, get it out whole, together with the cyst.	0.61892134
If the sac ruptures during the procedure and you are unable to remove it intact, this happens often, so remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it, because if something remains of it, little or much, the merchandise will mostly return.	But if the capsule is torn in the course of the operation, and you cannot get it out whole, which frequently happens, remove it bit by bit until there is none of it left. For if a part of it is left behind, either great or small, the cyst will generally return.	0.8127841
If it overcomes you and a little of it remains, cauterize the wound when you are finished with some sharp, corrosive peaks, and tighten the wound and place over it something that soothes the hot tumor, and treat it with other treatments until it heals.	If it defeats you and some little piece of it remain, pack the wound, when you have done all you can, with some caustic powder and bandage it and put on it something to ease the inflamed tumour, and treat in the usual way until healed.	0.78482497
If the merchandise is large, then stitch its lips and treat it with what heals.	If the tumour be large, sew the edges of the incision together and treat with stimulants.	0.7098992
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it tight for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides, then return to cutting what remains of the merchandise.	If you should come across a blood-vessel, pulsating or not, and there be haemorrhage, hasten to pack it with pounded vitriol; and leave bandaged for two or three days until the wound becomes purulent and the boiling-up of the blood is allayed; then resume cutting open the rest of the cyst.	0.86100495
