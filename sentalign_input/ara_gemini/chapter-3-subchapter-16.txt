Chapter Sixteen on the Reduction of a Fracture of the Leg
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula. They are subject to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm, and therefore their treatment is the same as the treatment of the arm, and the procedure is one.
If both bones are broken, the leg will turn in all directions.
If the thinner bone is broken, the leg will turn forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken and it happens from below, it is something that is not hidden from you.
So use extension and alignment and tying splints according to that, except that if the fracture of the leg is severe with many fragments, the extension should be less and lighter, and be gentle in your effort to treat it.
In the leg, there is something extra in the procedure compared to the arm, which is that when you have aligned the splints and finished all your work, take two thin strips of pine wood, which are used in leveling rooms, that are placed between the cracks of the planks, or they can be from palm leaf ribs, or similar, and choose from them those that have a little thickness and are not thin, and let their length be the length of the leg from the knee to the bottom.
Then wrap a cloth around each one twice along its length, and place one on the leg and the other on the other side, and let them be from the knee to the bottom of the foot.
Then tie the two thin strips in three places, at the ends and the middle, for by this restraint the leg is prevented from tilting right and left and is well stabilized.
A wooden gutter may be used along the length of the leg and placed in it to protect it from movement, and it is most important to do this in a fracture, especially if it is accompanied by a wound.
Then check the leg every day and take great care of it for swelling or inflation or any of that, so whenever anything of that happens, treat it with what is necessary until it heals.
And the leg bone heals in thirty days or so.
