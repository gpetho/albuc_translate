Of the rupture of the artery
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin over it is closed, an abscess often forms, and the same happens with a swollen and abscessed vein;
and it is recognized as being from the artery because the abscess is long and deep;
and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightness;
and when it is from the vein, redness from the outside is apparent;
and it is foolish to cut open this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits, in the groin, or on the neck, and in many other places, and is very large.
It is therefore necessary to avoid the iron cure, and the one at the head must also be avoided, and in the one that is a swelling of an artery, make an incision along the length above the skin;
then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues until it is exposed;
then place a needle under it, and make it pierce through to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then puncture the area between the two ties with a lancet so that the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is drained;
then administer the treatment that causes healing by suppuration, until the ligatures fall off;
then treat it with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is because of the cutting of the vein, then you must hold in your hand as much of the abscess as you can, along with the skin, then put the needle under the place that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce through, and have a double thread there, so that you pull it to the other side;
then tie off the abscess, as I told you, with a ligature on one of the two sides with the two ends of the thread;
and if you are worried that the thread might come out, then put another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision point of the first needle, and secure the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess flesh and leave what is tied;
then put on a cloth moistened with wine and oil, then administer treatments with tents and ointments until it is healed.
