I have given you the completion of this book, which is the science of medicine, in praise of the physician who made it, and through his examples, and his statements, I see that you comprehend this well to yourselves in this treatise, which is a part of the operation which I call surgery.
The first source sentence translates to: "However, the operation is performed on our territory and in our time with complete privacy, as soon as I deemed it necessary due to the science of the matter and the witness of it being left; and I did not want to describe it in any way in the books of the ancients, which would have been too long for the sense of the matter and the art.
It is observed to me that you are alive in this order of this treatise on the second way of exposure and declaration, and for the reason that it comes in the forms of the tools of cauterization and of other instruments of the work as it is for the addition of the declaration, and for the preparation of it, which is necessary.
The cause for which the artificer is not able to make the arm as it should be in that time, is that the art of medicine is long and that the actor does not know this to be exercised in the science of anatomy which Guillaume entered after knowing the properties of the members and their shapes, and the connection and separation of them; and had knowledge of the bones, nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their kind; and of the pulsating veins and quiet ones, and of the locations of the inflammation of the same.
For that reason, Iocaras says that he is named with a small book, but mainly in the art of medicine.
We have not yet said anything about that in the beginning of this book; for what we have said about anatomy is not known to many, and if it is not well done, many men die because of it, as you have seen many of them, who are formed in this science and get their knowledge from that science and its experiments.
You saw a surgeon fold his hand and had experienced an abscess in the chest of a woman, and had incised some arteries of the chest so that great blood flowed out when the woman died between the shoulders of him.
When another physician saw that the patient was suffering from a stone in the bladder, which had been processed in his state, and the stone was large, and it came out of the patient and was squeezed on the other side of the water, so that that man died the next day.
And you had called for help to remove that, and you saw that because of the large size of the stone and the position of the thighs under him that would die.
And I saw another physician who took payment from a duke of our land for surgery, and went to a black cradle which was made for the fracture in the thigh; and the physician, being ignorant, treated the fracture, over the plague, with pulvinars and estellas, and did not let the plague escape.
And it follows the rules of the doctors, and the relief, and the relief according to the number of days and commands that we unwind the limb; and I saw that the thigh and the foot were forged, and it came out in loss.
When you called for me and appeared, I quickly undressed you and managed to achieve calm and ease in alleviating your pains.
However, I already confirmed that the corruption had spread to the member, so I could not stop it and had to continue spreading the corruption throughout the thigh pericardium.
I saw another doctor who performed an abscess on the cancer patient, and it ulcerated after a few days, because the malice of the lord of the body was revealed.
The cause of this pain is that the cramp is caused by melancholic humor, and it does not matter if it has been infused into the lord of the body, but rather that the member which suffers has been harmed by all.
Therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the operation be performed in two stages: one is in the operation associated with health, and the other is in the work that is held in the larger dispositions.
And you have already existed in this free place where the operation was performed in which error and fear were committed; therefore, it is necessary for you to guard that and lay that aside, so that the children do not fall into speaking and with you being unjust.
When you prepare your weapons for the concern and protection of God, and your patients for their necessity and closure.
When you use the best way through the grace of God, they are saved and praised by the succession, and you heal the most difficult diseases, and you keep your weapons ready for what frightens you, so that your faith and your name do not abandon you: four more remain in your glory, and put on earth and in others' sanctity.
Guilt has already been confessed in some of my mistakes. Do not medicate diseased patients, for if the bad ones do not rest.
And you have already had to write this free book three chapters.
Begin the division of the free book, and first of the first part. The first chapter ordered within the head of the foot, in the forms of the instruments and in the forces of the cauteries, and so that it is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second source sentence to translate:
This sentence appears to be discussing the division of the third part, which is related to restoration and displacement, as well as the treatment of twisted and semblant parts. Here's a possible translation: "The third part, which is ordered from the head down to the feet, and from the forms of instruments, is divided into three parts: the first part is the head, the second part is the neck, and the third part is the trunk.
I ask about the quality of the materials used for that cauterization and in what collection it is forbidden to use cauterization.
Therefore, I say that the speech on the quality of the material for cauterization and the collection is long and prolix, subtle by knowledge, and secret; and many wise men have spoken about it, and they disagree with each other, and for me a little of their words is enough to fear perversion.
And therefore, I say that cauterization comforts the whole universal collection of its material or its matter, except for two collections, which are the hollow matters of its matter.
In the hollow and dry collection of its matter, it dries up; four others said that cauterization is used for that, and the others said the opposite, that cauterization is not convenient in illness, which is due to quality and dryness, and nature of the fire is quality and dryness, and it is not appropriate that illness be cautious and dry as it is cooked and dried to be healed.
When one says the opposite of this, that by cauterization, it is beneficial in the entire tail of the female body and dry that appears in the chest of men, when you compare the chest of a man with his humidity to the entire fire, it harms the chest of a man.
And you say for the speech of this, that I have already experienced this with my own eyes in discovering.
But rather that comes to mind is that which has already been expropriated and exercised in the capital of cauterization for the exercise, and known the diversity of the composition of men and the disposition of the diseases in their members, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the space of time of those.
But rather in other compositions, it is not about your fear, and mainly in the wet and dirty diseases, where all doctors are agreed on this, and are not discordant in the benefit of cauterization in these.
And wise sons, children, know that the secret of curing by cauterization for fire and its benefit is in cauterization for medicine, as it is simple, the fire which does not reach the member which is cauterized and does not notice the other member but only adjusts it with a little harm.
When the pain reaches the joints of the body, and often it happens in the difficult-to-heal limbs, and it is not easy to alleviate, it is necessary to seek medical attention immediately.
The fire, due to its sublimity and good substance, does not cause harm unless it is excessive. And we are known by experience and long service in the art of understanding the true causes; and for this reason you are excusated from the length of this speech, and if it were not for your free will in this moment to speak about the fire, and the quality of the operation of the heart and the expulsion of the sickness through which the sicknesses are expelled, the philosophical speech would be demonstrated, which is sharp in your minds.
Indeed, children, when it is convenient to cauterize and rest the best time of the day, they do not follow the time.
And you say that cauterization is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by the passage of time is submerged in the youth of that which has the cauterization, and especially if the cauterization is for pain or necessary pain, more and faster, those that do not suffer delay for so that it is feared that those that will come are malicious, which is greater than small harm entering through time.
When there is no pain in your feet, or rather, as they say among the common people and barbers, this is because the gout that is cured by cauterization does not always heal at once, and it takes time for the consequences to appear.
The cause is not that they are hurt for that reason, but rather because cauterization is not always effective in the place where medicine is applied, which alters the composition and dries out the humors that cause the pain.
However, cauterization is often used over medicine because of its great value and the virtue of its operation and the greatness of the Lord's servant.
It is possible that the disease may return at some time, according to the composition of the disease and its location in the body, as well as the virtue of the patient, and that which is prepared in the heart of the patient from the addition of superfluities in the patient, and that which has been received by the patient through his victories and similar causes; but if the disease to which cauterization is administered is a subtle disease in the member of few superfluities and humors, then it is possible that in that place the pain will not return, more so because it is small.
This is indeed a common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and it is said that it does not cure but rather profits from medicine or another cause. This means that cautery is used as a final measure when all other medical treatments have failed. It is believed that cautery does not provide a cure in itself, but rather complements or enhances the effects of other medical treatments or procedures.
However, the cause is actually the opposite of this; and I understand that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not true unless they administer the medications for certain diseases and those medicines do not work, and at the end of the cause, it is the physician who uses cauterization to relieve the patient and profit from it. This means that cautery is only used as a last resort when other medical treatments have been tried and have failed to provide relief or improve the patient's condition. The physician then turns to cauterization as a way to alleviate the patient's suffering and potentially benefit from the procedure. And I understand that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not second to what I understand from the common people and many of the doctors. This means that cautery is truly the final measure in medical treatment, and it is not simply a matter of tradition or popular belief. It is a well-established medical practice that is used only when all other treatments have been tried and have failed to provide relief or improve the patient's condition.
When cutting the points with a pointed cautery, it is better to use one made of gold than iron, and do not cut it otherwise than by equality of the gold and sublimacy of its essence.
When determining the location for cauterization, ensure it is not too close to the skin, as it may not be absolutely effective, since you have already attempted and experienced that it does not work in any other part of the body except for this one, and cauterization is better than a surgical knife; however, when performing cauterization, use gold instead of iron, as it is more suitable for the intensity of the gold, and prepare the receiving freg; and if you adjust over the ignition, the gold may pierce the skin, and there may be some layers in the focus that the artificer will use for this purpose.
And therefore, cauterization with iron should be made lightly and carefully in the direction of the operation.
And you have already ordered this capital in cauterization according to the other capitals, and ordered those of the foot within the feet, so that the patient can ask for what he wants from it.
The first capital.
This cauterization confers humidity and coldness upon the accident that caused it, causing soda and multitude of rheumatic fluxes, called corissa, from the head to the parts of the wings and eyebrows, and multitude of sleeping, and toothache and gout, and universally of all maladies that appear due to coldness, which are paralyzed, sore, and apoplexy, and seem similar in those maladies.
The form of this cauterization is this, which initially commands the thigh that the evacuated waste from the unclean part of the body, for three or four times, according to what is required by the virtue of the thigh and the age of the person and their custom.
And how do you command that the razor cuts, and how do you place that on your thighs over a low chair and that places your hands over the chest you want?
And place your hand on the razor's edge, placing the point of the razor on the nose of the person you want to cut. However, as the previous sentence said, mark that location, and then ignite the olive oil cauterization, and this is the form of it:
And place that on the marked location, with your hand descending, which is tightened little by little, and you rotate that.
And take your hand lightly and look at the location, and if you see any part of the bone exposed in any amount of the head, then according to the quantity of errors, raise your hand, and if not turn your hand on that iron, on another of that, if it is cold, enter that as you have told you.
And take a small amount of salt and dissolve it in that place and stir it three times.
And stop on the border that is begging to be cut and stir it over there when the scar of the fire is destroyed. And cure the place with an anointing tetrafarmacon when it is healed.
And it has been said that when the Roman plague opens the bowel, so much honey gets into the breast, because it is better and less harmful.
And they advise those who have the tail cauterized within the bone, and it is held by the cauterization until it is swollen in any part of the spinal column.
And let it be known that this remedy adheres to the bone and its cure.
And they advise others that the cauterization goes to the bone and its remedy is as follows: when it is applied with force to the bone, if it presses hard on the bone and the bone breaks, this is the form of alphecati petit: They estimate that the vapors of the head will escape from that place.
If the wound is held for a long time and is cured within the time it has solidified.
I have not seen these kinds of cauteries used on anyone before, except in cases of fear; and if that is the case, you must, for your health's sake, do it as soon as possible, when the head is divided by a solution of continuity of the vessel, which has been observed in other parts, and particularly when the head of the foot is of natural nature.
And the first kind of cauterization is not as safe and you should do it; and from that, for your health's sake, it is better to do it.
Chapter second.
Of head cauterization.
When throughout the head there is chronic and long-lasting pain, and it is prolonged in the foot, and used are needles, thorns, purgatives, plasters, ointments, candles, and wax, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery that has not given way to the cause, you should consider whether the head of the foot is of great creation in its nature; and if it does not bleed much, you should cauterize it with another cauterization afterwards. When it is necessary to make points on the surface of the thigh, then do so with a pointed cautery. Incise the coda and expose the bone to reveal the quantity that has been found, and cauterize it with a cautery at the tip of the head in the area called the "V" and place your hand there to keep it warm. And then take your hand away, and do not discover the bone, for the thigh suffers from a different kind of pain than the pain from all other cap cauterizations.
And you direct this cauterization to its place, where it is said that this cauterization is used for the cauterizations of the thighs and the occiput, and a subtle cauterization is made on that part of the head; and this is the form of it.
Chapter ends.
Of ancient non-analogous cauterization.
When the pain in the front of the head becomes severe, or if there is a sharp pain in the wrist, it should be removed by medicine from the head, and the other cure should be administered according to the diseases you have mentioned; and this should not be neglected, cauterization can be made in two ways: either with acute medicine that burns, or with iron.
May cauteries be used in medicine, as you take a heated pin, and press around those areas of the wounds, covering them with something to prevent infection. And if you find the location of the pain in the temple, use a sharp needle and enter it where the pain is located, entering it as far as it is hidden.
And press firmly on the affected area with a cloth, and leave it for three hours; then take off the cloth and treat the wound with two or three times a day, and return to the area submerged in water when the place is sore.
And cure that as soon as it is healed.
If you see, use some burning medicines that you have written in the book of burning medicines.
The use of cauterization is followed by this method: iron for cauterization, and this is the form:
It is called a clamp clavicle, where the top of the wound is shaped like a thorn in which there is a curve, and in the middle part of the wound it is slightly eminence.
And place your hand over the painful location, and pull out the small bell slowly - so as not to tear the artery that is left - and roll the small bell little by little at high speed.
If the quantity of blood that is consumed by the part of the spine that you have opened, and it is raised up, then raise your hand but not so much that the artery is not raised up, so that no flow of blood comes out.
And if you happen to have a piece of copper in water and place it on the area, and leave it there for three days; and then place a piece of cloth around the border, and take care not to expose it to any moisture.
If you see, make a point at the end of the thigh using a cautery, and watch for an incision in the artery in this unusual part properly.
Capitol quarter.
Of ancient emigrant cautery.
When you cure the ancient emigrant by the treatment that has been said of the previous cure, and what has been said in the divisions of the diseases, and do not take advantage of the cure, and sometimes for the disease that does not suffice to the first cauterization of medicine or the cauterization of fire, you will see that you cut the thigh with the cauterization tool at the location of the pain, or wherever it is; and then stop your hand for a while and press it over the incision in the artery and pass it through the bone.
The first source sentence translates to: "However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the mandible, which is harmed by chewing, and that the tail does not become enlarged and the nerves that cause that, and that it does not expand too much.
If it is about the custody and caution of the flow of sand from the artery that is blocked, then in the abscess of the same it is feared, and mainly to that which ignorantly does what he does not study and does not practice; and therefore the operation is started on the same.
And you will come to remember the regimen of the flow of sand in case of an accident to the artery according to the right hand, in the place where this is located.
E si you see of this malady that does not satisfy this cautery and see the course of the wound tolerable, cauterize it in the same place as the head of the thigh has been cut, and cure the plague when it is healed.
E if you see, maintain the cauterization that has been said in the capital of stretching of the artery with an increase of two points, and this cauterization is better than the previous one and gives less pain.
Capital.
Of the cauterization of the pains of gout.
When in the gout there is pain in the foot due to swelling and it is cured by treating the causes locally and by the other treatment that I have said in the division, and the pain does not worsen, then you must cauterize, and this is the one that is called a point, of which this is the form:
When making a point on the nail, and it is to be placed at the circumference of the entire toe as the nail rotates, or in the circuit of any part if the pain is in that part. After applying the cautery to the toe, there will be fewer and fewer blisters that will eventually reach the intended location.
And if the cautery points are made all over the toe, and it is taken care of, and the affected areas are cared for, they will eventually be healed.
End of volume VI.
Of cauterization of burns.
Burns that are cured and treated with cauterization are not the same as those caused by scars, according to what has been said in the sections of the diseases.
Avoid cauterization for sclerosis or spasm of the nerves.
When you cure the burned part with jewelry, gauze, and bandages, and do not comfort your cure, you have to cauterize the toe three times: the first time is the tip of the toe, the second time a small piece of cloth is placed there to hold it in place, and the third time the conjunctiva of the two lips.
When stopping the hot iron for the opposite side of the affected part, it does not seem to have any effect on the part that appears healthy.
The method of cauterization is that you cauterize the tip of the extremity of the swollen nose with a small piece of the corn of the head, and on the other side, the length of which is equal to the length of the same part, and then your hand is placed there until it is burned by the amount of the tumor of the affected vertebra.
This is the method of cauterization, and it is specific to the surgeon, the form of which is shown on the table. However, it seems that this is a small point that few people understand; and indeed, it is superfluous to add too much detail on this matter.
And then cure the area with what is indicated in the process when it is healthy.
Capitol, Volume VII.
On the cauterization of ancient apoplexy.

For the cauterization of oblivion, a flat one is made.
Cover them with large and small pills to make the vagina comfortable.
And rub the whole of the vagina and stop on the inside of its wall, as described in the chapter of the plasters.
And stop those veins, as much as possible, and that is the manicure of the cautery. And do this according to the order that has already been said.
And if for those who are sick, it is; and otherwise, make three cauterizations on the same side of your head, which are coming from the side of the forehead to the side of the chin. And stop between each cautery the largest part of the said, and proceed with care to the cautery as it has been said.
If the patient's thigh is tolerable, then make the cautery on the inner side of the thigh; and if there is more addition, make the cauterization on both sides.

When treating that which is healthy, and this is olive oil cauterization.
I'm sorry, I need the context to provide an accurate translation.
Of cauterization for epilepsy.
It is not cauterized the epileptic except that epilepsy is by fleecing.
And therefore you modify the brain of him at the beginning of his youth and at the other treatment that they have ordered in the division when the thigh is large and tolerates the exception of the medicines.
And if it is an infant who did not tolerate the medicines, then administer guarguarissmes and mastiguatoris to modify the serum, and this for several days, for the benefit of the wounds.
And cut the head of the thigh, and then cauterize that with a cauterization in the previous location of the head, and another cauterization on the occiput of him, and over each corn of the head you can cauterize. And if the thigh is strong and tolerates, then cauterize that with the ones I have mentioned, having paralyzed and softened the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
When the cauterizing oil is applied, it should be followed by...
If the patient is young, then stop cauterizing with this delicate method.
Capitulum XI.
Chapter on Cauterization for Melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are humid and corrupted, and have become very large and flaccid, then cauterize those parts with the cauteries that have been mentioned for paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is superfluity and declines into melancholy, and the thighs of the patient are wet, then give him this remedy to purify the brain after that which was given before in the division.
And shave the head of the patient, and make a small round cut, and place that over the top of the head, and tie it down in that location of the head.
And the patient's head is sixty years old, and he is held by all parts.

And you want that over the top of the head of the patient in the circle, and you should let him go in until he is warm.
And you apply this to the thigh once a week for a few days, or in the other regimen of the patient when he is cured; or if you prefer, cauterize those points as small as possible, but make sure you have the order of an attentive cauterist: this is a specific type of cauterization that hydrates the brain with equality.
And you stop that hair from being wet or damp.
Capital, Chapter XII.
Of the cauterization of water that comes down in the heel.
When you are declared that water has come down in the heel by the senhals which I have told you in the division, you begin and give in the buttock to the patient what is necessary to moisten the head of the patient, and hold that with all humidity.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Then command that the head be shaved, and cauterize that part with the pointed cautery in the middle of the scalp; and cauterize that part with two cauters on two temples if the commencement of urine is in two waters, or on one temple if the commencement of urine is in one water.
Cauterize all the veins and arteries that are left behind the codpiece; and these cauterizations are to be made in that point on the temples.
And keep watch for the flow of salts when cauterization is performed; and if you see the flow of salts or any medicine, keep it for your own use.

Capitol, Chapter XIII.
Of cauterization for the smell of the nose.
When you are treating that which has been said in the division and does not benefit from your treatment, then you should show yourself and give to the patient's thighs three blows with a cushion; and then cut off the head of it, and cauterize the small nail with the larger nail. And then cauterize that small nail with the large nail on the two extremities of the hair, leaving a small one.

Capitol, Chapter XV.
Of cauterization for the softening of the eyelids of the toes.
When the eyelid of the toe is softened by poor care or moisture, then you should cauterize that eyelid with a cauterization of this kind; and this is the form of it:
If you, make incisions on that side of the two fleshy parts with a small sharp cut, and let the ends of the tendons be long. And the length of each incision should be according to the size of the fleshy part.
Do not press too hard with your knife, but according to the size of the fleshy part that is being cut.
Chapter 16.
Of cauterizing the eyelid of the cat when the whiskers are converted into parts of flesh and finger.
When the whiskers of the cat are converted into parts of flesh and finger, cauterize at those points with two knives, either one or a burning iron or a medicinal iron.
If you cauterize with fire, command the patient to look at his whiskers as they are, comparing them to those of a man, and if the finger is prolonged and twisted, then you must stretch the hairs of the cat with a needle so that it is not broken when those whiskers are born.
When newborns and infants start to cry, it is necessary to stop the mouth of the child in the middle of the nose, and then cover the eyes of the baby's face with a cloth, and hold it until the sign of death appears on the baby's face, and this is the beginning of the action of the doctor.
And then stop cutting the hair in the scalp or on the neck with scissors or tweezers, and shave the beard if necessary.
Then use the cautery of which this is the form of it.
And then cauterize over the figure that you have covered, little by little, in circular motions, until the surface of the skin is charred like a candle, completely apparent actually.
And the sign of health of the second work is that you see the eyelid of the face already closed and the eyes of the baby raised, you have to make the puncture of the eye.
And then raise your hand and leave it there for three minutes, and then cover the hair that borders it until the scar is healed. When treating that wound, enter it if it is healthy.
If the eye returns to its normal position due to any cause and the eyelid is softened, then make another cut with the cautery on that same spot as before.
If the eyelid is inside the eye, then make the cut on the side that is raised to the natural location and is engaged and does not push the tears out.
If the cautery is used in medicine as you command on the thigh that the eyelid enters and is prolonged and engaged, and it should be made in the form of a mirror's edge, then it is appropriate to make it with a piece of paper.
And take a piece of cloth and soak it in live coals. And, or rather, and mix those causes with it, and make it into a paste for the purpose that it may not be frozen; and expand that over the paper that is made in the form of a mirror's edge, and place it over the other eye; and place the other eye on the album page, and the cap of the thigh should be at the top.
When the doctor pauses about the medicine and asks if the patient feels the taste of the medicine, which taste is in the mouth as if from fire.
Then, when the patient perceives this intense taste, the doctor will give the medicine and ask for water; then, when the taste stops, the doctor will wash the mouth with water and consider if the eye has been washed with water as it should be with vinegar or with lemon juice, which is pleasant; and if not, he will return to the medicine at the location where it has not been applied yet and has not been damaged by your operation and has not contracted the cold.
Then, he will stop shaving around the area where the wound is and care for it with ointment or another substance to make it heal.
It is necessary for you to ensure that your operation guards against neglectful diligence in the eye and if the eyelid is swollen every day and some cause of the pits in the eye is in the eyelid, you must repeat your medicine over that location where the eyelid is swollen, and as you did at the beginning, and if it becomes healthy.
This is the form of fuelha of magic.
You know that the joints of men vary according to size and thickness, and therefore, according to this, your contraction is made.
And do not assume that the path of rectification is towards that which is being studied in this art.
Capitol, Chapter XVII.
Of the cauterization of the fistula that is in the lacrimal of the eye.
When you cure the fistula as they have said in the divisions of the diseases and do not confirm your cure, then you should cauterize according to this manner: command the disease that pauses the cap in the upper part, and hold the cap of it between the upper parts in such a way that it is not rough nor agitated by the upper part.
And then pause the cauterization enfusion in the album of the wool or in the mucilage of the ptillon over the hip of him.
And then ignite the cauterization that this is the form:
The which is cured, how it is formed like a cane or a pen of the voltor, from one end to the other, where the cauterization is made.
If you wish, it may enter into the other end. If you want to be in good health as you try.
However, that which is more difficult is better than the second work.
And apply the fistula if it is opened, and then remove the disease and dry that part. And if it is not opened, you open it and extract the sore from there.
And place your hand over it with the cautery that is not yet lit, and take that as the first part of the tieua, but a little of the cauterization of the hole in the nose so that you do not err and the thigh is quiet, and you place the cauterization on the gray of the hole and corrupt it.
And if at the beginning of the cauterization it enters into the bone, then so be it; and if not, you repeat the cauterization one or two times, if it is skilled; and let that stay for three days, and place your hand over it with a border and turn it until it is dry inside that it is cured.
If it has been passing several days and the patient is not getting better, you should stop using the acute, corrosive medical treatment and wait until the bone is discovered and is smooth according to the capital's custom.
Another way to make a cauterization of the fistula: go to the location of the fistula and then pause at that small opening in the subcutaneous tissue where the form of the fistula is; and put in there the quantity of one and an eighth drop of pus fundut; and then apply your hand on the thigh with good retention, and do not hurt the patient because the pus fundut does not reach the hole of that; and cover that with albumin or water, four drops of pus adhere to the location of the fistula and heal it for the meravilhora sanacio.
If the fistula is healed as they have said about cauterization and cure, then so be it; and if not, you must administer narcotics through the nose and reduce the fistula to the nose of the patient according to its location.

When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth become loose, and they are treated with medicines but do not heal, then place the corner of the mouth over the wound in the middle of the face, and approximately ignite the cauterization in the form that will best suit you, as if you were pressing the tooth against the cheek and enter the cauterization quickly, and then take a small piece of paper that the mouth covers the heat of the fire at the root of the tooth to become heated.
And take your hand, and iterate the cauterization on some points according to what you want.
And let the patient hold their mouth with salty water for an hour and see if it holds, and then check if the loose tooth is closed and the gum is strengthened and the corrupted humidity is dried out.
Capitulum xxi.
Of cauterization for tooth pain.
When tooth pain is caused by coldness, or it is frozen, or vermifuge, or the medicine does not cure, then you should cauterize on that spot with two hands: either with the cauterization of cowhide, or with the cauterization of fire.
If you do not know how to make the incision, take some pieces of cow or beef and cut them into strips, then fold them over the end of the nail, and press that piece against the painful part firmly until it stops bleeding.
And if you go further, it may reach the root of the tooth.
If you go further, place wool or a knife on the edge of that, and press it against the painful tooth, and press it against that burning iron when it reaches the edge of the cavity of the tooth.
However, cauterization of the foot is that you attend to the wound or iron, and it is in the body of some flesh and the sharpness of the iron does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And if you light the cauterization in that form, and press it against the tooth and put your hand in it when it is hot; and make some observations of how the pain remains or on that day or the next day.
When the pressure of that cauterization makes the wound close and hold it for an hour and remove the cauterization, this is the form of the cauterization.
When you see that the end of the point is close to your hand, then heat it with fire.
This is the form of the cannula:

De cauterizacio de extrophulos" translates to "Of cauterization of extrophulos
When extrophulos are of flexion and of cold humors and not obeying the digestive tract by medicines, and you see the digestive tract showing slight signs, then you ignite the cauterization with the form that this follows, having two ends with which you can scrape the smoke from the other end, and pause the ignition over the wound one vein, and another if you prescribe, until it reaches the opening of the wound.
If the gout is small, you should stop the cauterization according to the amount of gout, and then press on the area for three hours and leave it there, as it may be useful to relieve the pain caused by the fire.
And take care of that wound and try to dry it within what is healthy.
Chapter 23.
Of cauterization of inflammation of the throat and constriction of the neck.
When cold humors invade the bronchus, and more so when there is overall frigidity, you should cover that part of the body with something warm, and then cauterize it at the point of the groin in the area that is affected.
And be careful not to get the cauterization on the groin or burn yourself from the waistbone of the body, but only a little.
And you should cauterize that part with another cauterization at the joint of the knee in the upper part of the leg. And the cautery of this should be made in the manner previously described.
And similarly, take care of that gout which is previously entered, if it is cured.
Capitol Chapter 24.
Of cauterization of the lung disease and cough.
When the cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors and the patient does not have fever or chills and it is an old cough, then cauterize that part with two points on the shoulder in the areas where the bones are loose and swollen; and also cauterize at the mouth's side between two milks; and let the cauterization be done by a clavilh according to the previous form.
And if you want, your cauterization is made with points at the cauterizations called points, in the form that precedes in the relief of ear pain.
And points are inside the bodies for those; and similarly, take care of that gout which is previously entered if it is cured.
And if the cauterization already has three ramps for that cauterization, you can make three points according to this form:
I apologize, but I am unable to provide a translation for the source
From the cauterization of the tip that is the head of the assistant.
When the helper's head is dislocated due to slippery humors and does not stop in the moment of returning, it must be returned to its displacement within which it was at that time used to return, and by a slight movement it is dislocated again as if it were being pushed back, as we have witnessed, reducing first the displacement, and then the buttock is placed over the knee or over the axis; and then raise the spine that is in the part of the fingers of the left hand to the parts where you place your thumbs when the joint is dislocated at the parts of the fingers.
And it is important that the cauterization has two heads; and this is the form of it:
And it is important to cauterize the spine when it penetrates into the other thigh; and this figure of cauterization will be of four heads cauterization.
And some wounds are adjusted according to this count and by the cauterizations that are.viii.
And then place your hand over the cauterization point and make it stick to the wound, and the member will not hurt for any time as long as it is comfortable.
And if the dislocation occurs in the parts and tart is called gout, then make a cut on the muscle at the cauterization point or on the points of cauterization, and when the joint is confirmed and the moisture is removed and the thigh is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When pain occurs in the stomach and moisture enters that part of the body, and if you continue the treatment and do not confirm, then it is possible that the thigh is over the seat of pain, and extend your hands and feet and make three cuts on the cauterization point as follows: one cut of the size of a certain cauterization point, and two cuts on the two sides of the cauterization point, until the figure of the triangular cauterization is formed; and stretch those that are not adjusted to make a suture.
If the depth of the cauterization is the quantity of the two thirds of the length of the coccyx.
And if the figure of the cauterization is this form, and if you want, cauterize with a large cauterization in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this is a cauterization according to the form of a circle according to this form:
And if the stomach is cauterized at the point that is feared by this cauterization: and it is that you are over the stomach with points according to the quantity you want, and then cauterize that point in the cauterization; and then cure that part of the cure that was previously treated until it is healthy.
Chapter 27.
Of cauterization of the gout of the foot.
When the pain in the foot increases due to coldness or wetness or large ejection, and the coccyx is getting out of its normal position and is being pushed out by excessive excretion, and this coccyx is laid over the cervix, and you are afraid to do three cauterizations according to this form and this quantity on the foot below the hip bones, the doctor will lie down in the decubitus of home.
When the space is equal to the size of the largest part of the body that corresponds to the cauterization, and the cauterization is made along the length of the body.
If you do not understand your own cauterization method.
If the amount of water that is applied is equal to the amount of the specific part of the intestine, and it is not adjusted; and if the thigh is on the feet of the patient; and if it is not, then the hand should be gently held, which has already extended its fingers, and raise the patient's knees.
And can you possibly cauterize these with a cauterization iron, when you have skill and prudence in the art?
And be careful not to process too much in the cauterization, and apply the specific part of the entire intestine throughout the body, so that the entire intestine is inside the feet, where the thigh is subtle; and you know this.
Chapter 28.
Of perforation of the wound by the cauterization of the patient.
When there is pain or inflammation in the foot and one wants to know if the inflammation is in the flesh or in the skin, if it is in the flesh, the leg becomes heavy and painful at its point of origin.
And if it is in the skin of the foot, then the pain is sharp and often exhausts the doctors with their treatment of him.
Therefore, the leg should be covered over the shoulder blade; and clearly mark the location of the inflammation that has been caused; and carefully choose the cauterization that is most suitable for the form that is prescribed in the next page. And cauterize it and cauterize when the entire chain is burned, when it reaches the hip, when it goes through the skin, when it causes pain.
And treat that for the cure of the other inflammations when it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this form of cauterization except for the one that is studied in the art of medicine is prolonged, and in those from which many diseases are cured; but this has been experimented on some wounds that were severe about this operation, but less so than the one that we must use, and it is more effective.
1. Quan dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors
When joint pain is caused by cold humors, it is called gout by doctors.
When the ancient cauteries of surgery are used for the treatment of flees in this manner, and it is this that you take from the flees of alchemy, long and dry a flee that is found, and it is of the largest kind of the same.
1. And you have lowered that part into oil and fire, and have cauterized it with a cautery in that place which is between the bones of the elbow and the collarbone; and two small cauteries were placed further away, one slightly declining towards the side from which the beard was cut off, and two cauteries in that position which are declining between the fifth ribs and the breastbone, declining a little on the sides; and another cauterization in the lower part of the chest; and another over the stomach, and three cauterizations on the sides; and one cauterization in that place which is between the two shoulder blades, and two cauterizations on the two sides of the stomach, further down the cauterization which is between the two shoulder blades.
2. And do not worry if you do not understand the use of the cauterization, as it is in the manifestation of the code in work.
3. And it has already been told to those who use iron cauteries similar to fire and ignite that place, and place it in that position between the ribs, entering that and the aposteme, and remove the sania if it is present there, as they have said in the aposteme of the patient.
In this incision, no fear of cauterization is needed, for it often happens in the place where the fistula was made and is not treated.
The first line of the text is "Capitol .xxx.
Of the cauterization of the mast".
When you treat the wound of the mast, it is customary to say that the treatment is in division and not your own treatment. Then cauterize on it, there are three ways, all of which are correct, one of which is to make three cauterizations or four lines according to the length of the mast according to the figure of the cauterizations of the patient, the figure of which has preceded.
And between each cauterization there should be the greatest part of a penny or a few mes, and the hand of the cauterization is the hand that has been said in the cauterization of the patient's engagement.
And do not understand your wound, and the wound is easy on the other side.
And there is another hand for cauterization, so you think that you do not know the cauterization because you have two vertiments, which have been said in the capital of dislocation of the muscle, and elavate the codon that is at the end of the mast that passes through the left wound.
When you raise your hand above the patient's back to the longest part of the body, so that it is cauterized according to the latitude of the country.
Then enter the two fingers, carefully, in that point where those parts of the spine are penetrated by the codena.
And remove the cautery; and then it is four cauteries.
If you see, cauterize with three fingers.
And then you cure the cauterization that lies flat on the thigh for too long, which may be more comfortable than the previous causes in the cure.
Capital .xxxi.
Of gout cauterization.
Cauterization does not work on gout but on alcohol properly.
When you cure the gout with the cures of the curacy that have been said in the division and do not confirm your cure, you notice that this cauterization has four cauteries in the circuit of the belly and one cauterization on the stomach, another on the thigh, another on the meatus, and two cauteries between the spines of the two, one cauterization on the right side of the chest, and another cauterization on the stomach. When the depth of the cauterization is appropriate for the tip of the finger.
And then apply the cauterization carefully, so that it does not cause pain for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment immediately after the cauterization, as it is necessary to add more ingredients to the medicine, and quickly return to help with care.
The shape of the cauterization is like that of the abdomen that is being cauterized, and it is that which is in the form of an olive for the other, following the previous form.
Capitulare Bypassus
Chapter 32 of the Capitulare Bypassus on the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen and full of stagnant water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the thigh in a place that is between the ear and the anus, and raise your hand over the cauterization and do not pull on it; and then raise your hand, and do not return to that place for everything, as long as the stagnant water remains.
The first source sentence translates to: "This is the method of cauterization: On each of the two thighs, place two cauteries, and on each of them, make a cut at the end of the cauterization blade. When making the incision, follow the length of the thigh: and then the denuded and the other side the edge of the thigh; and over each thigh, two incisions are made.
When the plague is opened for long periods of time, as some poisonous waters come out of it.
And cure those causes that have been said.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of things from the belly.
When things from the belly are perforated and become infected due to coldness that weakens the intestines, it is the digestive and retentive intestine, which is in the stomach and intestines, and should be treated as part of the curative measures and not confessed, and sometimes the thigh suffers cauterization of the intestine exposed, they are cauterized with a large cauterization over the stomach according to what has been done in the cauterization of the stomach, in the cauterization of the circle, and four cauterizations around the subtle embellishment, in the clavicle, and cauterization on the subtle alloy over the large aloes, or two cauterizations.
And if sometimes the exuberant humors and the thigh tolerate it, they should cauterize that over the pentenilh and the intestines, and very well adjusting two cauterizations over the stomach and a part of the thighs, four is perfect cure of which you do not err.
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treatise written
De cauterizacio de emorroydas antiquas" translates to "On the cauterization of ancient gout". This
Quan so en la natura derier emorroydas antiquas o una de humors grossas fregas o de humiditatz corrompudas, e son curadas am aquo que havem dit en la divisio e no confereys la tieua curacio, lahoras cauterisa am tres cauteris sobre le pus dejos spondilh del dos petit e petit triangular, e am cauteri desus le ombelic cays per dos ditz." translates to "When ancient gout or a gross humor fregus or a wet corruption is found in the body and is cured by the doctor without leaving any other cure, then three cauteries are made on the pus of the spondilh of both small and small triangular, and two cauteries are made on the ombelic cays.
If the stomach of the patient is inflamed and the food of the patient is not digested, and the face of the patient often blushes, then do cauterize that on the stomach with a large cauterization as precedes; and a cauterization on the thigh, and another cauterization on the belly, and leave the cauterization for some time, and cure the patient when it is healthy.
Capitol xxxv.
Of cauterization of hernia, the opening is appropriate.
When you cauterize the hernia, you must choose the cautery that is closest to the ray. Place that cautery in the opening of the hernia, and then close it with a thread, and enter when the cauterization reaches the orifice of the vein of which you see the sanc.
And make one or two, if they are many, cauterize each of them according to what they have found, and cure those who confer the enguents when they are healthy.
If you cauterize with a large cauterizing iron on flesh, it will not heal well.
Capitulare de nobis et familiaribus. (Capital of our
The treatment of cold humors that cause joint pain is called gout by doctors.
When nature does not obey the work that has been recommended in its place, the patient is frightened by this, and it is cured with cauterization.
Therefore, when one finds in nature fistulas that are old, the skin is corrupted and the humors are corrupted, and therefore it is fitting that a probe be made with great care, and the depth of the hole should be measured in front of the point to be probed.
It is believed that the cauterization resembles fire. And place this cauterization on the fistula, and according to the quantity in which you have traced the point.
And continue over that until the burned parts of the corrupted corpses are completely blackened or two or three times, according to your need.
1. Keep an eye on the combustion of nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the heart of the bladder or the heart of the intestine, keep an eye on all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a place of flesh and thinks it is not penetrating.
2. Then, if the location inside that is healthy, proceed.
3. If the location is sealed, and the materials have been removed, and there are signs of healing over time, you know that it has been cured completely.
4. If the materials are not of the patient's own, you know that they penetrate or in the prescription of the patient they corrupt, or cause aquos to fall from those causes from which remorse will be remembered in that place.

6. Of cauterization of the warts.
7. When in the warts there is pain from cold or from large ventilation, and if the thigh of the patient is heating up, you know that cauterization should be done on those over the warts, am cauteri sobre quascun ronho am cauteri clavilh del qual precesic la rememoracio.
When it is necessary to treat a wound with a cauterizing iron, then place the iron on the wound for a short time, and three lines of cauterization will be created, and fewer blisters will appear in the future.
This is a Latin phrase that translates to "Capitol 88.
On cauterization of the bladder.
When the bladder becomes thin and malleable due to cold and humidity, causing the urethra to not retain urine, then cauterize the affected area at the end of the urethra with a cautery iron, and also cauterize at another point in the middle of the urethra.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the number of notches on the punch; and cauterize that at the lower end of the two, or at two points if necessary.
And the cautery should be made according to the process used.
This is a Latin phrase that translates to "Capitol 8
On cauterization of the clitoris.
When cold and humidity enter the clitoris, and there is no possibility of circumcision, and the menstrual flow becomes corrupted, and its provocation is delayed, and pain occurs in the area of the clitoris, then cauterize that location with three cauteries along the umbilicus as was said in the cauterization of the bladder; and cauterize on the lower end of the two, or at two points, and make the cautery clavilh.
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treat
ion, specifically about cauterization for the treatment of ankle displacement. Here's a line-by-line translation of the text:
When humors become wet and infiltrate the knee joint, and cause inflammation of the surrounding tissues, and it is said that the thigh is extended over the other when compared to it. And the location of the dislocation becomes flattened in that way.
Then, it is advised that you cauterize the thigh over the knee joint of the cauterization tool in a similar way, because you will have to touch the circumference of the joint as it swells, and so that the joint falls into its proper position.
And the cauterization tools used precede the form in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cauterization is not available to you, then perform cauterization on that part using three cauterization tools made of olive oil.
And the amount of cauterization depends on the quantity of the dissection of the entire colon; and it should be cared for when it becomes healthy.
Capital. Chapter XLI.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain is felt in the shoulder part, and its cause is due to cold and dampness, the body is treated as has been said and not confined, and this is antiquated, and one should cover the shoulder with large pills made of fresh or artificial drugs or similar substances; and it should be cauterized there.
And the hand of the cauterization is followed by two hands: either the cauterization is made with burning drugs, or it is made with fire.
Two scientific hands are used, of which one is the one that cauterizes it over the part of the ankle of the patient, and three cauterizations are made in this way, on each side; and they should be done at good depth. And are the spaces between each cauterization the quantity of the thickness of the drug and if the cauterization is made with oil or with a large one.
Some may be that the cauterization is made over the middle of the head of the ankle for that there are four cauterizations.
And if you want, cauterize on the circle that is preceded by the form in the cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle, and that it is a circle continuous and burning the entire chain.
This is the method of cauterization in cold cases when pain is adhered to the ankle and not extended within the thigh.
If the wound is extended to the thigh, then burn it with two burns on the thigh at the location where the evacuation of the evil will cause pain; and a burn on the cavity with four cuts of about a finger's length on the part that is most affected.
If the burn is deep, and the depth of the burn depends on the amount of the intestine that is pushed out.
If the evacuation causes the pain to spread throughout the area where the cut was made, then burn it with three or four or more points of burn if directed by the evacuation.
If the evacuation causes pain to be felt further down the thigh, then burn it with a deep burn on the thigh.
And be careful in all burning that you do not use the burn as a nerve or great artery, and that for this reason you may cause the patient to suffer from pain or contraction.
And you have seen one and the other of those which were burned on the cavity and after in the burning, and the bed was inflamed throughout that the tumor achieved the knee, and the bed was burned and corrupted and corrupted the whole knee. When a sudden and serious condition of the stomach occurs, and it leads to death.
If the pain is in two parts, then cauterize each side of this handle.
And use the following methods in cauterization of anguish: make it resemble a circle of iron, where the circumference is the largest part of a palm; and be sure to use it according to the largest size of a sharp bone or a few.
And make that circle another one; and be sure to use it according to the quantity of the bone's notch; and those circles should be divided into two parts; and the length of those sides is a notch or two notches, and make those edges slightly visible in the circles; and this is the form of it:
Then place it in the fire when it is wrapped, and let it emit sparks, and place it over the part of anguish, the thighs covered with a cloth. And then cauterize that part three times in a line.
And let it stay for three days; and apply this ointment to the affected area multiple times; and care for it so that it becomes healthy again.
Albucasis: Oh, sons, of this kind of cauterization few have used due to the fear of the gaze of it, and therefore few have found those who look at it.
May the cauterizations be fewer on those who suffer from this, and they will diminish that place of theirs.
Less cauterizations are used in medicine because you make two circles with armillary spheres perforated in the one that has the gullet of the door of iron; the length of the sides is in the youth of them or as those.
And if the space is less than the quantity of the size of it; and they are opened further and deeper, and they hold that between them this form:
And place your hand over the end of the ankle, and compre the tua ma over the end of the ankle; and take water from the tail and pour it between two circles, and that quality of that is as the small fire little by little, and you that for the quantity of one hour, and suffer the malaute the mordicacio and the adhustio of lu — quar that atrobo mordicacio ayssi como de foc — after that the mordicacio ceases.
When raising your arm with the instrument, avoid touching the wet tail of the entire water needed for the wettest water.
And press on that border for three days and then continue pressing for three more days, and run the poultice; this helps in relief.
And cure that part as soon as it becomes healthy.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make that statue in it which contains water according to what is made in the wetting of the joint.
And this is the statue of wet tail water, and you have already written that in the book of the correction of medicines. Recipe for alkaline and inextinguishable fire of one part, and add water to it and let it rest in a new wave of the quality that is poured into the ring, according to the amount that enters into it.
And let the fountain of the other wave be poured into another carried wave, and add water to the live alkaline and fire of water that requires two drops of the quality that is given by one drop, and say that you understand this in the first part for good compression, and press the hole that comes from the hot water in the fountain into the carried wave.
And properly adjust that water, and place it on another to live and another alkali, for that if it is made of strong acidity, it will be maintained in the operations of medicine and cauterization of other members, for which operation a fire is used.
And some of the medicines are some that are cauterized wide, as they are with thread and honey, and cause a sabose in which they are mixed.
And Guilia recounts a man of ancient times about the operation and cure, which is cured of pain in the knee and sciatic nerve, and many are the benefits of that, and it is said that no other cure is needed, and it is healed by a vein such as recommended, where much of that intestine is placed in bath and already knows how to do that.
And if it is near a certain tree, and if it is not dry, then the female genitalia is held in recent; and if it is cut off with a few gray hairs, and placed on the knee where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the chest, and it is seen.
If the pain is not relieved after three hours or when the patient has lost three pints of blood.
Then apply this to the affected area and when the patient's body is swollen, enter it into the ground, and the pain will cease and be healed.
Do you know that this treatment is not used with cauterization unless the evacuation of the chest is necessary?
I have already heard that when the goatskin fascia is cauterized with a tight vessel, it is best to use this method: hold the lana (wool) and wet it in ancient oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and between the phalanges.
And if you take dry goatskin and apply it to the foot when the pain is caused by carbon, and place it on the wool and leave it until it is expanded. And repeat this, and do not stop until the sensation of the biting disappears from the ankle and stops the pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of
the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And when the intest
ion has been reduced to its proper position and the hernia has been placed back in its cavity, your hand
and other causes of pain in the testicle, such as from tight clothing or from excessive excretion, and for those similar causes, due to the introduction of wet and moist matter into the body.
And cauterization does not always work on this alone, but only on the specific condition that is caused by the discharge of wet and moist matter.
Therefore, it is important to note that the evacuation of the testicle is similar to pills and is in the form of three lines according to the latitude of the body, and that the number of cauterization points or cautery may vary depending on the tolerance of the testicle and the quality of the man.
And it is necessary to note that cauterization is made with a pointed cautery.
If you wish, make points on three or four points using a cautery or four claviloth medial according to this form:

When the lower back pain becomes excessive and the patient begins to lean on other vertebrae, it is necessary to take action.
When you see this and want to stop, you can burn that point with a cautery, following this form: and hold the cautery on the entire part of the lower back spine.
And if you want, burn in the circuit of the lower back spine with the cautery of two or three points. And the points should be placed between them.
And treat the area that is healthy according to what they have said.
Please note that cauterization should not be administered in yellowish areas that are caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When treating gout caused by cold humors in the feet and not causing further pain, then use cauterization.
And is that you cauterize that appropriate evacuation in the circuit of the joint of the foot with the desired cauterization.
And is this the form of the cauterization:
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. If the pain spreads to the neighboring joints or other joints, and it is necessary to stop the pain, then use cauterization on each knee with three or four points of this cauterization oil.
If these cauterizations are necessary for you, then use cauterization on that and do not press too hard with your hand, only around the specific area of the knee.
If the pain spreads to both knees, then apply the cauterization that was told in the capital speech.
If the pain is in the most part of the body, and it is called sugar, then make points in the circuit of the limbs as they rotate, make points in those two lines.
If pain remains in these parts, then point on the circuit of the sweat glands over each nook and cranny of the body.
If pain worsens in these areas as the joints or muscles, then cauterize the entire part of the assistants.
And do not remove the badly managed patient and the reception of medicines, for if it is well managed and the condition improves, this cauterization will be beneficial, God helps.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of wounds.
When a wound occurs in the ankles and testicles, and the intestine passes through the hernia to the abdomen, then do as follows: first, order that the patient fasts on the day you command, and use gentle causes for so that the needle of the abdomen does not come out.
And follow the patient on your side over the abdomen, and command that you hold the abdomen until it is clear or there is a sign of the hernia or the intestine.
And then return that to the thighs and try again on the bones of the patella and send it to the end of which seems like the gout of a circle in the subcutaneous parts of the body.
And approximately how this cauterization of this kind is done:
When there is a hot pain in the body, it is called fever. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then pause the cautery on that spot with your hand, and if you can feel the pulp of the nail entering the hollow of the toe; and repeat it on another place if you haven't succeeded in the first attempt.
And observe carefully the condition of the intestine during your cauterization, that you do not burn that intestine because it does not come out over the thigh or other great misfortune.
And you know that if you do not feel the pain, do not consider your operation successful.
And make sure that the cauterization of children is done with great care according to their size and measure.
And keep the site of the cauterization for three days, so that the wound of the focus does not become worse.
And keep that for the other patients who are cured.
If the patient's thigh is put on the right side for fourteen days, so that the wound is sealed and there is no discharge.
And cover that you pause the nutrition according to the length of time of the cure of the patient, and that the intestine does not come out because of the effort to heal.
And when you want to leave after fourteen days, administer appropriate care, and hold it for another fourteen days.
And it is necessary to work and eat and drink, and to exercise forcefully, when you use this entire regimen of therapy, your health will be completely cured.
And you tell the cure of the ruptures in other parts of the stomach, and so on, and you want that they do not happen again, then cauterize the rupture with cauterization according to the quantity of the focus, and it is that it is exhausted from the codena as the last part of the stomach; and keep that which has been said and do not adjust.
When the first wound is made, the incision is cut with a triangular cautery according to this form, because it is easier to sew:
A line is placed perpendicular to the line of the wound, and another line at the end; then remove your hand from the cauterizing iron, which is better than the first one that was pushed in more.
Capitol 66.
Of cauterization of torsion.
When pain persists in any member due to strain or impact and does not relieve for a long time and does not please the physician's care, it is necessary to cauterize with a point.
And the cauterization of each member according to its magnitude and thickness, as well as its development and twist, and the location of the twist and the pain in the member.
If the patient is healed by the first cauterization, so be it; and if not, you will repeat the cauterization over it. Four times are customary for those pains that are located in one member and reach another member near it, so that you can reach them when the wound is healed.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided text "Capitol .xlv

2. "De cauterizacio de lepra" translates to "Of cauterization of leprosy.
When you want to cauterize that part, consider if leprosy is present and whether it has been cured as said in the division and not done, nor this, and fears about the thigh that corruption comprehends the whole body of him and the entire complexion of him, then cauterize that over the head with a pointed cautery: one on the left side of the head, and one further down, and then to the front of the hair; and two on the back, over the nape or servants.
Finally, when the cauterization has a little effect on the bones, and the scars are displaced, because the expiration of large vapors is relieved from him; then cauterize on the surface next to the pressure.
If leprosy has already expanded over the thigh and manifestly appears, then you should cover that which has been said in the head with cauterization: one on the extremity of the nose, and two on the eyes, and two on the collarbones, and two on the spine, and one on the spine of the back, and one over the shoulder blade, and one near the shoulder, and one over the shoulder, and one over the shoulder, and one over each shoulder, and one over each shoulder blade, and one over each elbow, and one over each wrist, and one over each knee, and one over each thigh, and one over each calf, and one over each ankle, and one over each toe, and one over each muscle; and cauterize that over all the joints of the toes and feet, and on each toe of the feet, and on each nail of the fingers.
When you hold the nerves that are over the sole of the foot that do not burn, it means that the treatment is working.
If some wounds are cauterized with a cautery over the bones of the pelvis and another over the mouth of the stomach, and another over the thigh, it means that the treatment is working.
You know that the more you cauterize, the less effective and painful it is; and you know that the thigh does not have pain in the cauterization, just as they have them, because the body of the patient has already been stunned.
And know that the cauterizations are large or small according to the members and joints, according to what precedes the specific tools of the instruments.
And care for the cauterization with flour, salt, and melted wax, and another cure if it is healthy.
Chapter 48.
About the cauterization of stunned.
When a member becomes numb or unconscious and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then you should cauterize that stunned member according to the size of the member or its smallness.
When the hot cauterization is inserted into the skin of the back, a few drops of blood will come out. Then apply this ointment to the affected area to make it heal.
Sometimes, cauterization is done on a part of the body that does not have nerves, such as the back, spine, and neck, and it does not cause pain to the member, and the wound heals quickly.
However, this should be done with caution, as only those who are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the body and the movement of the nerves throughout the body should perform it.

Of cauterization of burns that are fatal.
When the burn is old and does not respond to the application of medicine, you can cauterize over that area with a little more of the ointment until the whiteness and color of the skin become improved, and the color of the skin changes.
And apply a poultice made of oats and lentils mixed with rose oil and aromatic leaves, and a piece of cloth to the affected area, and place it over the wound until it heals.

When there are thorns that have been cut off from the body and placed in a circle around the affected part, as we have said, or in any other way, they should be burned.

Of cauterization of adulteration.
When some adulteration is delayed in maturation, and it is due to excess or the state of the patient, who is old and has few saints, or due to time, and you want to speed up the maturation of adulteration; then cauterize around that part with small points; and apply it so that it does not fasten in maturation.
If you want to burn the cauterization, then you must know the type of cauterization that this is the form of: and slow it down in the place of adulteration when it penetrates the coden.
And if the cauterization is placed in that place where it was left, for so that the body of the bracelet is healed; and take care of that within which it is healthy.
The text you provided appears to be in a medieval Latin dialect,
which can be translated as "On the cauterization of corrosions". Here's the full translation of the source
that corrosions are wandering corruptions in the body, which corrupt like fire consumes dry wood.
If you ever notice that the affected area is burned in place where it suffered cauterization, then you should know that few cautery claws are needed, and some larger ones depending on the place where it is burned.
Then cauterize that of the entire affected area until you completely eradicate the corrosion and do not leave any cause for it.
And keep that for three days, and then place your hand over the cauterized areas once a day until all the wounds are completely eradicated and all the corruption is eliminated.
And treat that with an ointment that stops the growth of flesh-producing tissue.
If after three days the flesh has healed in that place where there is no corruption, then it is; otherwise, repeat the cauterization over the areas that are still burning in the corrupted places.
And corrosion is treated by some doctors with acute medicine, four times a day in the place of cauterization. However, cauterization is not always effective in relieving pressure.
When I have already spoken of the cure of the patient in the division, and now take that which is necessary for the emergency.
Capitol, meaning "capitol," is a term used to refer
Of cauterization of the claws and other similar parts.
Wounds that are visible on the parts of the foot that have been clamped, and are caused by a large, deep wound, which causes pain in the foot; and cauterization is done on those parts with two cautery irons, either hot iron or cold iron.
Fewer hot irons are used that resemble a pin's heat, which is made of iron according to the quantity that contains the clamp in each part, and is made of thin segments.
And place the hot iron on the clamp, and turn your hand over to the cauterization around that clamp as soon as the cauterization reaches the depth of the clamp. And let it remain for three days after beginning to bandage. And apply the ointment made of salted honey on that part, and let it remain on that for a day or two, until that part is completely removed from its skin.
And properly care for the area that is inflamed due to the generation of dead tissue.
And if it does not convert, and visible inflammation occurs in the surface of the body, mainly in the chest and feet, you must believe that you are administering to those cauteries with wet or iron or nail point, and take a piece of cloth or a iron or needle point and place it over the claw; and pour a small amount of wet humor into the claw, and wrap your hand around the compress of your hand, and rotate the claw around the hole of the claw, and press the humor cauda via al preon de la razit del cau; and wait for the wound to heal by the mouth of the humor cauda for an hour, and then remove it, and keep the claw with its razitz sira erredicat.
And it is good if you have those and the other within which you come over all those that are in the body.
And care for those pus where the razits of the claws are removed as much as possible from the inflamed tissues that generate flesh.

When trembling occurs due to cold humors in the nerves or fever, or for some other reason, it is customary to cauterize that part with four cauterizations or one over the spines of the back, between each spine with a cauterization; and on the chest of the patient, and over the stomach of the patient, cauterize olive.
When the trembling of the patient's shivering subsides and the health of the disease improves, then it is appropriate to apply a plaster or bandage to the affected area.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but "Capitol .lv
A burn from an acupuncture accident can occur on the chest.
When the body exudes pus, and the pustules are filled with materials that are fatty and corrupted; therefore, at the beginning, as it appears, it should be cauterized over all parts of the fistula, which is the subtle cauterization under the skin, or the end of which is extended to the face; or it is due to prolonged erestologia; or it is cauterized slowly.
And sometimes the warts are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method; and I do not doubt it, and the excess is broken into pieces, making them healthy for those who have them.
However, I believe that this is an appropriate evacuation by curettage.
Capitulum LV.
Chapter LVI of the Book of Cauterization of the Flow of Scars from an Accidental Incision by an Archectomy.
Too many warts have flowed from the archaectomy that was made by the plague, which deformed it, or you must make an incision of the stitch or cauterization of the member, and then it seems to improve, and it is difficult to maintain that.
When one has an attack of gout, you should cut away the skin from the affected area and place it over the opening of the artery, and hold it there until that wound is closed and the flow of blood is stopped inside that part which was formerly the course of the artery, and it will not bleed.
Then pause in the fire the green cautery a few and large, by name, and blow over them when they are not yet hot.
Then take from those a small or a large piece of the skin and place it over the location and press it firmly on the vessel where the affected artery was located, and then cauterize it so that it is closed and restricted to that part which was formerly the course of the artery.
If the artery is expelled from the opening of the artery while you hold the affected part and remove the cauterization, then take another sharp cautery from those which are prepared in the fire and continue to do this until the artery is restricted.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are here, and come over to the other side another malice.
You know that when the artery flues, it is not possible to restrain the flow, and especially when the artery is large, it is not possible with one out of four manieyras: with one it is cauterization as it is said, with another it is extraction when it is not extracted, with four when it is extracted, the extremities of the veins are burned and the restraint of the sanc is restored, or it is liated by a fierce stretching or it is paused over the medicines of which the virtue is restricted by the sanc; and they are strengthened on the pulvinar of the constriction.
This is the first line of the text: "Mays aquel que aministra restriccio decent de lu am liament e am strictura am draps o per posicio de causas comburentz e de semblantz, no comfereys sino tart.
If there is no doctor or physician present and you are alone, then you should perform the incision on the specified site of the vein as they have said, and understand the great pressure that the wound will have on the remaining part of the plague, and on the artery, the said point is not rough; and over the artery, it is scratched with the water of great coldness that has entered when the wound is closed and compressed; and less should be thought about whether it needs cauterization or medicine.
Of incision and perforation, and ventosias, and phlebitomy, and of plagues and their like.
In the first chapter of the entire malady it has been said that cauterization is convenient and necessary with medicine, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments used in those cases are the forms of cauterizations; and I have ordered the chapters of the subincision of the head among the feet.
When you process in this capital for that particular purpose, so that the client will be satisfied with it, do as follows:
When you begin this procedure, son, remember that in this capital there is fear for you that it is in the first capital of cauterization.
For that reason, in this operation, which is this capital motion, it is necessary to take great care, as in the evacuation of the vein or incision over the aposteme or excision for perforation or purification of the plague or extraction of gallstones or incision of urine and its semblantz. When all of these symptoms accompany fear and trembling, and in the worst case, death.
You have been warned that if you do not take care of this condition, some people will use their hands on your body, which are already affected by illnesses. And they say that if you do not go to the doctor for your illness and it worsens, and because of the severity of the illness in your body, and because the illness is in your body for a long time, then the illness will kill you.
And among those is the one who gives you hope for your life and expects a cure, and the dangerous illness is pernicious.
And do not allow yourself to be deceived by the one who shows you that illness; and your caution should be greater than your expectations and your greed; and do not assume any cause for this except for certain science that knows this, and which will be passed on in a laudable way.
And use in the treatment of all your illnesses for prognosis and indication of the one who is healthy converted, wherein there is help for you over acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and of glory.
O, children, God has given you understanding and not to direct or protect you, for this is in your own hands.
When you order this chapter to distinguish it from the following chapters of cauterizations, for the care of the head within the feet, so that it is in accordance with your request and of the kind that has been requested.
Chapter first.
Of the treatment of water which is contained in the head of the child.
You know that these movements seen in the children's disease must be given to the child and when the nurse shaves the child's head, its life will be shortened.
And some are seen because of a lack of cleaning that is not cleaned.
I have not seen this disease but only in the children; and of all those that I saw were sick and because of this I have seen many works done on them.
And you have seen that the child's head was of water and the child's head was very magnificent when it could not be covered by the large size of the child's head, and less that the moisture is increased when the fire dies.
This humidity or is added between the ribcage and the bone, or is added behind the bones on the chest plate.
If the humidity is between the ribcage and the bone, and the incision is small, then you must operate in the middle of the head with a fissure of two inches long, and this is the shape of the sputum:
If the humidity increases and the incision becomes larger, then you will have two fissures according to this method:
If the humidity is behind the bones, then you will see the fissures of the head completely open and the water will be sprayed when you touch that with your hand, but not on your fingers. Then you must operate in the middle of the head with three fissures according to this method:
And take the incision out of all the humidity; and tighten the fissures with cloths and plumassols; and put on over them a covering and oil every five days, and care for the wound that you make and engorge, and tighten the cap with equality; and eat the member with little humidity when it is comfortable and healthy.
This is a medieval medical treatise written in a language similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The text describes various medical procedures and treatments for different ailments. Here's the translation of the first source sentence:
You should observe that the artery is not torn and does not cause blood vessels to bleed, and the patient's leg does not swell due to this flow of sinew.
Chapter Third.
When you cut the cords or wounds on the hips or chest, and it is common to do so, and no one confirms this in writing, but rather the medicine itself confirms it in this case of these two arteries.
And when you want to cut those that the patient wants, and sharpen the edge as much as possible with something hard, and strengthen the knee of the leg with a drap; and consider where the vein is; and the places of each over the places where the hips are, and so many hide them in as few people as possible.
And cover the artery that you intend to cut, and cut through each one with the sharp edge of the bone, and it will be easy to enter into the bone and be close to the head.
If you wish, enter the thick mucous membrane and run it along that artery to those parts of the body.
And if the length of the incision is twice that of the distance between the two points, when a vein is incised, the sinus escapes and is easily expelled, which deformed by frequent strokes.
If the artery does not appear in the incision, you should measure the amount of space from the three points, and approximately send it to the chest, and then enter the bone.
And if the amount of sinus that comes out is small, and less than the amount that should be, and then it is according to the quantity that appears on the surface of the thigh and the repletion of the artery of the patient.
And if you consider the plague, and if there is any cause of inflammation on the bone, then incise accordingly so that it does not lead to the appearance of gangrene cauterization.
And if you strengthen the plague with plasters and bandages, and cure it so that it is healed inside when it is healthy.
I apologize, but there seems to be an error in the
The translation of the line "De extraccio de las arceriales los cuals so en las templas" is: "Of the extraction of the arteries that are
The translation of the line "Quan ad alcu accideys emigranea antiqua o catertz agutz, per humiditatz agrimonials e per qualiditat en les lacertz des templas, o sodo antiqua vehement e semblantz ad aquels, e es medicat am las manieyras de curacio de medicina e aquo no comfereys, lahoras nos hem sproatz en aquestas malautias extraccio de las arcerias en les templas, o cauterizacio de aquelas ayssi cum havem mostrat." is: "When there are old and frequent anemias or catarrhs, caused by humors of a gross nature and quality in the limbs of the temples, or sudden and violent pains in those parts, and they are treated with the means of medical curacy and it does not help, we have found that the extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of those parts where they have shown, has been beneficial.
The translation of the line "E la manieyra de la operacio e extracio de aquelas es que·l malaute raza les pels les quals son en les templas; e entenda a la arceria apparent en le templar quar ela es a tu mostrada per le sieu pols, e·s occultada sino en paucs homes per vehemencia de freg." is: "And the means of the operation and extraction of those are those that raze the hairs that are in the temples; and understand that the apparent artery in the temple that you see with your eyes is hidden only in a few people by the force of wind.
If you are hidden, then the buttocks of the patient should be covered with some cloth; and around it, apply a cloth that is rough or damp with water, so that it appears to you that the urethra is clearly visible. And then take the suture material of which this is the form: And then sharpen the needle that is easy to enter into the urethra; and then get it in the intestine and extract that from the surrounding tissues from which you extract the thread of the sutures and discover those of the abdominal walls, of all parts.
If the artery is thin, then cover that with something at its extremity, and then insert it under the skin of the thigh, and then cut off a piece according to the quantity by which they are tied at the ends of the veins and are contracted, and if it is not cut off, the wound will not heal, for if it is not cut off, the suture will not close completely.
And then remove the suture from three times.
If the urethra is large, then cover that in two places with something so that it does not fall off or with strings of long length, and do not let it be affected by putrefaction during the consolidation of the plague and turn into wounds.
When you need to reduce the superfluity that is between two members; and do it at that time or another time.
If you want, cauterize that point with the cautery within the bone that is causing the pain, and stay in place until that work is finished.
It is better work if the patient does not have fever or is not suffering from an inflamed complexion; rather, cauterize those causes that help to reduce the moisture, and thus it is better for the patient's well-being.
Cover the extraction of the arteries that supply the area of the ancient crotch, and place them over the well-dressed polls, and apply it as medicines will make the flesh and bones stronger when it is healthy.
And while you are working, if you see a flow of sinew from the artery, then you should hold that sinew, or with cauterization or with something to cover the area of the crotch, and strengthen your hand within the sinew when it is tight. If the cause of those is not in your present, then pause on the side about which that part is surrounded, and wet the area with a wet cloth when the sharp cold returns, and it will become stronger afterwards.
If you are using a hot cauterizing iron, it is because you have already cauterized the vein at two points, and you have noticed the two holes, and then they will pervade the bone and indict the vein in two places, so that it is elongated as much as possible, which are not all supported by this cauterization.
This is the form of cauterization:
And is the sharpness of the two points exemplified. However, if the sharpness is less than two points, that is, if it is more acute than two points and does not penetrate the flesh quickly.
Therefore, when there is any growth, the heat of the fire is applied to those and the flesh is cut off slightly.
This work is better than any other in its kind and contains many examples.
And the spaces are between two thighs, the number of the largest part of the same.
Capitol quarter.
Of the care for the body of acute and acidic toes.
When the toes are acute and acidic, and the body of those veins which are over the test of the head from the forehead, and do not satisfy any cause of medical cure, and sometimes the face of the thigh becomes distorted and appears in the front of ambulation as if it were the ambulation of ants, and the toes become extenuated, humid in such a way that the old ones are not as they were before, and the nails are sharp due to the acidity of tears, the ancient diseases in the cure of this operation are spaced apart, and the cure is far from them.
And it is that you command the thigh of the patient the nails which are on the front, and approximately insert three fissures in the front three times the length of the front. If the length of the fissure is two thirds: the first fissure is a distant engulfment along the length of the nose in the upper part of the face, and the second follows the movement of the eyelids that are in the lacrimal, and the third part of the other.
When guarding the incision of the arteries that are in two layers, and extend your hand for the continuation of biting the mandibles. If the space of any incision is three times adjusted.
If you have a sponge or cloth wrapped around it that dries the sands.
Then insert the tip of two sharp ends, the one of which is the form of the incision of this: which is from the division of the temples to enter into the second incision. Excavate all the chain that is between two incisions over the bone, and if it moves to the second incision, proceed with the following: And then insert the rest of this and enter another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And hold the sharp side of that blade by the fat and the rest of the coden, and the leopard's claw over the bone, and press that inside where it came to the fissure, and cut off all those that descend from the head to the heels.
When the incision is continued along this path, and it approaches the other fissure.
And push that the amount of pain increases, expose the locations of the swollen feet of the patient.
And pause in each fissure where the old hair grows thick, and place your hand on those parts that are wet with oil and vinegar, and you will see that it does not cause a sty to form.
And on the third day, remove the liquor and administer a large infusion of water or tea, and apply this to the wound which is red and pinkish and other within which the diseases are cured.
Capital.
Of the treatment of hangnails by cutting and the lines descending from the parts where the nails are attached to the finger.
When the nail is cut and continued, and sometimes the lines of the fingertip become very small, and the eyes are affected by them, and the ulcers on the eyelids, and in the head of the finger there is sharp pain and excoriation due to this accident, you know that these things happen because the materials and nails do not come from the veins of the parts where the nails are attached.
The best cure for this condition is to command the patient to face the wall, and then insert a small object (such as a knife or a bone) into the opening at the front of the head, starting from the left temple and moving towards the right. The object should be inserted until it reaches the skull, and the patient's mouth should be open to facilitate the process.
Dry completely the affected area with a sponge or cloth, and then fill it with a mixture of water and vinegar. Then apply a paste made of powdered herbs and oil to the affected area, so that it does not cause further irritation or inflammation.
When you see that the apostem has diminished, apply a poultice made of powdered herbs and oil to the affected area, starting from the nayser carn and moving towards the skin. The poultice should be applied to help dry out the flesh and prevent further inflammation, as if you were mixing flour of wheat with four parts of colfen and adding water, and then making a plaster with the mixture and applying it to the affected area.

When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.

Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out. You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands. And then pause in the circuit of the aureola around some parts of the thighs, and extend the aureola to the parts thereof, as many loops as possible are forgotten about these causes.
If no blood is drawn, then you administer an extraction of the affected part using the instrument called the "gestic" which is subtle and of the following form:
If you forget the gesture, it is fine; otherwise, you administer the extraction of the affected part using a subtle and small number of doublings.
If you do not forget the gesture for this, then you make a cannula of aram and enter the tip of the cannula into the opening of the anus and close it at the end of the cannula with wax and olive oil so that it is not scratched except for the cannula. And if you extract from the top of the ventricle, three or four watched eyes come out, as follows:
If you do not forget in this procedure, you catch the halo of the alum or the veil with the affected parts, one at a time, and place it on the end of the ray, and then gently blow over that corner of the decentent. And if you enter it into the anus for convenience, and remove the anus of the moisture.

The hand of the wound is that you cut at the beginning of the vein of the sephasic, extracted from the second hand of the virtue of the patient, and then make that cezer between your hands and convert the aurelha into parts of it, and for a small fissure in the edge of the aurelha, you must let out the blood in the place where it is most painful. If the fissure of the lunar figure is within the foot, and the foot has wasted away, remove that if you can with appropriate instruments; and at that time, cut quickly and cure it within the foot that has been healed.
If the cause of the abscess is one of the greasy ones that have grown and are inflamed, then you administer the cure and extract it; but if you do not obey your appointment, then you should take subtle tincture according to this form: When administering care to that wound of that part which was caught in the thicket.
Do not do this when you think that part has already been moistened by the steam of the thicket, and pause there for a while, and take out those with your fingers or with a gentle touch, or if you have to cut it, then it will be easier to extract it.
In the water that was inserted in the thicket used for condiment, and fill the thicket with old cloth, and put the water on that thicket where the water is, and if for anything else you forget, then so be it; and otherwise, take a few peyrass and leons according to the length of the same, and heat them in the fire, and place one of those in the entrance of the patient's thicket and thrust it over a peice of that part and percussia am another peyra over the peyra that is dintz the thicket. Then do not stop this until all the water is forgotten.
Then do not stop this until all the water is forgotten. When the gout has been dried out and you have taken it with paper or cloth, and then place one end of it in the anus and extend the other end outside until it is burning and the pain of the gout has subsided.
And as many times as possible enter the vagina with a piece of cloth and a gauze, and press it against the extrauterine urethra.
In the removal of an animal that has entered the anus, if it is small, use gentle pressure and a warm solution as instructed in the division; but if it is large and causes pain in the abdomen, administer the removal of the intestines and testicles, and determine the cause of the pain from all other causes that may be found in the anus.
In the removal of a worm born in the anus, when you treat that worm as instructed in the division and in the treatment of distillations and do not satisfy your curiosity, keep the anus moist with the sun.
If here any cause of the gallstones is found, take that one by the thumb or index finger, otherwise do not take it, and if no cause is found, take a catheter and insert it into the large intestine, and this is the form of the gallbladder: When the extremity is gently inserted into the ear according to the amount of pain it suffers from the injury; and then apply a little of that which is suitable for relief, and make a few circular motions, until all the vermes are forced out.
If you do not obey my instructions, then you will plead and close in the circuit of the canula as they have said; then administer distillations which have already spread the antiparasitic in the treatment of worms, and you will find it in the chapter of distillations.
And is your effusion the one that funds the medicinal oils in the ear with this instrument of which this is the form of it: Make that of silver or of gold, straight, in which there is a small hole, and it will be easier to use.
And so it is when it is placed in the cavity of the canula of continence here where it may be necessary. And if you wish, take the ray and gently cover the extremity of the ear with it, and place a little oil in the cavity of the ear, or from some herb, or whatever medicine you want in the canula — and that is in the ear —, and gently insert the ray into the ear and press on the other hand that one which has been compressed in the ear when the oil is expelled in the cavity of the ear and the injury feels the oil.

Of the cure of worms in the bile.
Some worms are found in the intestines of older people and have been found in the intestines of men, worms in the bile caused by poison or by no meat; and this worm is found in the prey of the liver which does not feel the weather, and some are found in the deformed parts.
And that which happens in the prey of the liver, which does not understand the weather, is in the most difficult cases of difficult treatment.
And if you can understand the weather in that case, cover the bile of the thigh with the sun and look at that. And if you see apparent puffing, open that and sprinkle with that fine powder which is the form of this:
If the extremity of the one in which the smallest latitude is, of which one part is acute and the other not; and the excretion is of two lemons per so that it does not cause discomfort to the ears.
If warts appear on the skin or in the flesh of the foot, then you can use fine needles and apply them with great ease when there is no more flesh left.
If warts appear on the outer part of the foot, then you can use a fine needle and heat it up a little, and then insert it into the flesh of the foot.
If you feel that the treatment is becoming more difficult due to fatigue, try to increase the pressure on the foot; and remember not to hurt the nerves of the foot.
And then stop in the foot for a while before the second amount of Egyptian oil that you have wrapped around the foot; and make sure to do this every few days when you are sure that the plague has consolidated; or if you pull out any and immerse it in water and powder it over the sore and use it from there; and if the foot becomes infected, then make sure you don't pull out the same one and replace it with another one that you wrap around the foot as red as possible, when the infection is cured; and take care of it inside to make it healthy again.

When there is swelling in the eyelids, it may be caused by a variety of factors, and for this reason, it is called "grandfather's gout.
When there is an addition of thick moisture in the outer corner of the eye and outside.
Therefore, the operation on them is that it is considered proper if the increase is due to water that appears in the outer corner of the eye and is not good for all parts; and the cause of this is unknown.
Therefore, pay attention to that fissure in the latitude, and withdraw it as much as possible from that part, and suspend it on that point and descend it as much as possible.
And if the figure is large, you adjust it with suture; and care for that after it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not suffer badly for that, as you restore the part and make it look like skin.
And if the increase is declining in the parts of the eyelid, you must superficially cut those parts, and then close the opening with sutures, another that you prescribe for the beginning, and press it on the entire part, and if the eyelid is elongated due to the incision, then you will not notice any cause for this.
When preparing for the incision, wash the hands with salted water; and care for the location that is where the blood will enter that is healthy.

The cure for the eye is to wash the eyelid with water.
If gray hairs are formed in the eyelids, and especially in children, they worsen the appearance of those and cause discomfort to them; and they cannot see the clarity of the sun because of this, as some wrinkles gather around those.
And have you ever noticed that those wrinkles appear on the face all the time, and especially when they are sleeping; and then on the eyelids of those after waking up, which already have inflammation, and an increase in redness appears in the eyes; and if you touch the area with your hand, you feel a burning sensation.

When you are about to cut the abdomen, first clean the area with a disinfectant solution, then make an incision according to the shape of the white glass vessel.
Then remove the clothes that you have folded between the thighs, and separate them into two parts, one on the left and one on the right, until it is dry.
And make sure you do not adjust in the incision so that the sweat does not reach the hole and causes damage to it.
If you do not see your arteries at the beginning of the incision, then adjust the incision with a small piece of cloth easily within the process of cutting; and take out the ones that have been said; and submerge the clothes in water and wet them, and put them over the place and stretch those am polvils.
And then take out the saline solution and remove that in the cavity of the incision, because that is what remains of that moisture.

When the eyes of the labia are red, swollen, and filled with tears, as if they were constantly crying, and the skin of the lips is smooth and soft, it is a sign of damage to the labia that is called tactinir of the labia. To treat this, you can use four methods: either by cauterization using hot iron; or with medicinal cauterization according to what is written in the capital of cauterization; or by making incisions and sutures; or by cannas according to what you have said.
When closing the space between the patient's thighs, place a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands. If the eyelid is converted to the left side, it is not correct; if it is converted, do not do it; otherwise, make a hole in that part where the pus is located further than the eyelid, and let the hole penetrate into that part, and then it will be - the margin of the eyelid where the lashes are, the lashes themselves, and pull out the filer from the parts where the lashes are in the eyelid, and convert it to the parts further than the eyelid.
If there is a spot in the corner of the eyelid where the lashes are adjusted to the incidence of the lacrimal major entering the lacrimal groove; and if you extract the filer and hold the eyelid open with small combs or blades, and then cover it over the eyelid, and it will be as if a candle flame is held close.
However, it is important that the figure follows the amount of swelling of the eyelid, which has already been differentiated in men, among which those who are indicated that a large quantity of swelling should be inserted into the eyelid according to the quantity by which the eyelid is softened.
When there is cold humors that infiltrate the lines of the eyes, and it starts from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, then... (Please provide the full sentence for a more accurate translation) If your incision is as sharp as the king's biggest finger, then... (This sentence suggests that the incision should be very precise and sharp to ensure a successful procedure)
And place the nail in one of the angles of the abdomen, and excise the entire area, and adjust the stitches as close as possible to the lips of the mouth or subtle furrow of the chin, and remove the sutures, and make it adhere if it is superfluous over two folds of the skin for any reasons you want, but if not, do not cure. (This sentence seems to be a description of a surgical procedure, possibly related to a cosmetic or reconstructive surgery)
And you should change the sutures of the lips after three to four days, and take care of it. (This sentence suggests that the patient should follow up with their healthcare provider to have the sutures removed and to ensure proper healing)
And if you want, change the plaster of your stitches, and take care of that as it dries and tightens, for the eyelid becomes red, you must use the bandage of the plaster and its addition, but fewer stitches are better, and so do not taxanir. (This sentence seems to be providing advice on how to care for a wound or surgical site that has been closed with plaster)
When it comes to the matter of the thighs, there is indeed concern about the operation, and there is no fear in this matter.
There is another method in taxmir, and it involves putting something over the eyelid that resembles a dead fly's eye, and then raising the eyelid in three points, separated by this form:
If it is not possible to have the points, and if it does not hurt, then you should take a string and tie it around the hair that has been cut, and insert that into the eye of the figure, and then enter the other fiel prop le lacrimal major, and the other fiel second prop le lacrimal mendre, and adjust between the ties so that all the fiels are equal, and then raise the entire codena over the one that has been put in as they have recommended.
And then adjust the lips of the wound am sutura, and cure that which is healthy.
If you happen to have an abscess, you must clean that abscess or that wound with your hand, and with the same herbs and ointments, and with the same medicine.
When some eyes are affected by the eyelid that they have been converted into, then you should use the one that has been mentioned for this gout; less suture is needed in those cases than in artificial ones.
Ataxinir am cannas es segon aquesta forma: This means "To cut the cannabis is the second form of this." In This means: "And you cut the eyelid and divide the figure that is behind it according to what I have discovered; and for art's sake, make holes in cannabis or in subtle astelas of which the length is the same as the length of the eyelid and the latitude is the same as the latitude of the spatum. When you have previously incised at the ends of some parts, you will find the threads there.
Add a little subtleness to the gout that is superfluous on the eyelid of the hollow, and compress the veins of some parts with a firm constriction, and let it remain there for several days, so that the coda for the stricture dies and is rejected and becomes infected if it is touched by anyone.
If you are delayed, you can cut the gout with the horn, and cure the plague within it if it is cured.
When it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not hang down.
And this is the form of doses that you make following this form: and has the quantity of the longitude and latitude, neither more nor less.
Capitol. xii.
When the hair is dry, it makes a twisting movement in the eyelid because the hair is tight.
When the hairs are not natural, hard and rough and sharp on the eyelids, you perform the operation in it as if you were holding a subtle one and pressing on the subtle edge of the leopard, and as if you were adjusting the ends of it and the points of the nails in your hand with great care. When the length of the fingers is equal to the width of a palm.
Then, if you want, cut another finger on the side, and clean the ends of that one.
Then, place the patient in the upright position, and use the sole of your shoe as a scale to determine the size of your work, which is a small and delicate operation.
Then, introduce the needle into the corner of the eye that requires reinforcement, and make it penetrate deeply into the eyelid until it reaches the outer edge of that part of the eyeball.
Then, pull the eye out through the socket and introduce it into the cavity, and there should be one or two or three eyes, not more.
Then, pull the eye out through the socket and insert it into the cavity, but take care not to pull it out if the eyeball is inside the eyelid.
If you are pulled into the cavity and do not pull the eyeball out, you will pull the eyelid into the parts where you have cut the finger that you have made, into which the eyeball is pulled by the truss.
When you look at the wound, four of the fingers and the thumb are best to use, and gently push on it. Then close it with two days or three, until it sticks to the right place and covers over the good flesh.
If the wound is too small, you should adjust a longer natural gauze and elevate it over the wound, or if it looks like it is not long enough to fit properly in that space, then you should lift it up.

May the manicure of the operation in it be that you push that consolidation and separate the lips of it, and place on it as there is between those one machine of cloth of it, and tie those when they are healed.
And do not think that you use of cure of it from the causes which dry them, I advise you; rather if you make sure returns to return to the exudate pus that no time in the fire will have.
Use in that of causes which mollifies the flesh as is the fig, and moisten with water in which are coitals alta and semensa of it, or engulf dyaquilon, which is liquefied am the oil, and immerse in that the machine, and cure that.
And the treasure of your cure is that you pierce all the engage which is not solid according to the form which fire has at the beginning.
And this operation which has been said is not any rectification of the cushion that does not return the form of the place according to what fire has given at the beginning.

If the figure of the eyelid returns to its original position, and if not, take the mirror and place it on that side, and then convert the eyelid, and make the cuts in the eyelid's edge further away.
And the ends of the cuts of the two angles of the incision, which you made inside when they were running, and the angle of one of them within which the figure of that one is formed.
And this figure is Greek: the ladder.
And it holds the flesh of that amount by the quantity of the leg that is further away from the eye, so that it does not tear the eyelid.
And it adjusts the separated parts and ties them with that thread; and it cares for those that have said about the mollifying medicines and the cataplasms when they are healthy.
If you scrape or cut or cauterize, then you should make a flat cut on the eyelid's edge according to what is previously specified. And separately cut the skin between the two lips that they have said.
In the sum of the speech of the cure of gout when it is removed or placed, that runs in its operation, according to the form of gout, and that is in the form of different waves.
And the artificer makes every time an engine in each hand that is possible to return the figure to its natural form or part of it, and that one is according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the larger possessions.

Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens in some men that the eyelid is solidified and placed under the albumin of the eye, and is prohibited from the ease of movement and its natural works, therefore you must enter the extraction of the ray from the eyelid, and raise it therein, or extend it to the upper part.
And if you insert the adhesion under a fine sputum, which is not of acuteness of the incisions, having obtuse a small part so that the operation is not troubled by this, and remain the sputum that does not affect the eye with its acuteness.
If your incision is showing that the adhesion is easily removable, then return the eyelid back to its original form and make sure the entire adhesion is cured.
And if you put in the water, salted water, of which you wash; or distill in it, dissolved in water.
And separate the eyelid from the water, and place your hand over the water, and the third day use caustrative substances within which it is healed.

Of incision of the eyebrow and elevation of the eyelid.
You know that the eyebrow is made up of two layers, one nervous and resembling a thin, hard substance; or it is not nervous, resembling a white, damp substance, which when touched with the finger, or attempted to be drawn out with the nail, is separated and the nail does not stick in it.
And if you apply the specials only to the larger eye, then it covers the vision and prohibits the light and movement of the eyelid.
When the hand of the worker is in the area of the body where the hernia is located, and they perform the incisions, and raise the eyelid to your eye, and close the wound with sutures, and extend the stitching to a few parts of the body. And then insert an eyelet and enter it into the same orifice of the horse, or cow, or calf, or sheep, or double the end of the eyelet little by little and place it in the corner of the needle, and push it through the needle; and extend it to the parts on your body, and clean the hole with the tip of the needle that will touch the pupil. And do you follow that with the eyelet into the hole of the penis.
And then you insert the romanent into the pit of the lacrimal gland subtle or with small forfexes, and examine the flesh of the lacrimal natural to see if it will not cause continuous discharges of mucus.
When someone asks if you have seen the sun on the skin that has been extended or tightened, say yes, and approximately how far it extends, and this is the form of this:
This line can be translated as: "Ensure that the ointment does not touch the outer layer of the skin and that it is applied to the rupture, and that the pupil is perforated.
When the incision is made in the hip, a few drops of blood or a point of pain is felt, and it should be cared for the next day; and that part should be covered with a dressing to prevent it from getting infected.
If the wound is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it placed in that place, then this type of wound is cured by medicine, and it is healed as you are advised in the division.
If you want to open that incision, then you should open the space between the thighs and place a thin knife of sharp edge according to this form: with subtlety. If it happens that the wound is cleaned and closed and enters into another day, then you should distill from your mouth in the hip of the point of pain or the point of the knee or the point of the elbow, and cover the wound with a dressing.
And repeat over that the operation until it is completely healed, unless that contrary to the stitch, which should be in the hip, then you should open that, and cover the stitch at the beginning, and cure as soon as it is healed.
And furthermore, repeat your operation over that same part until it is healed.
If the tear of the lacrimal gland is noticed in the eye due to great pain, it should be suspended with a piece; and cut out that part, and do not leave the incision so that no tears of lachryms come out.
And furthermore, distill in the lacrimal well and apply it within when it is healed.

Some of the scars in the knees are made from the flesh of aloe, and they are placed over the pupil or under the eyelids, or they are cut over the eyelids and the edges are sewn together with a thread of balaustra.
The operation on that side is what you need to stop the pain in the thigh; and cut the scars of that and sew them all together with the convenient pieces of flesh, and use a forceps or a pair of tweezers; and cut the flesh at the beginning when everything is finished within the incision, and keep that from coming out of the wound during your operation.
If your incision is on the part where the surgeon has recommended to make the incision in the umbilicus, or if small petits forfexes are used which are attached to the abdomen according to the shape of the patient's belly, then proceed as follows:
Then when your incision is completed and the entire flesh is covered with that powder, you must fill the hole with salt, or drop some of the powdered rogue on it, resembling the corrosive medicines, and stop over the hole deformed as it was before, ensuring not to get cautery.
And if you are affected by gout and the doctor gives you a cautery, and you fear cautery, then clean the wound and treat that cautery with this that yields to that cautery, and repeat over that during the operation until it is healed, and seemingly put something in the flesh that accumulates in the wound of this speciality.
But may I advise you that all cures of the wound by natural or accidental means, iron, and do not place your hand in any of these operations until you see that this member is suffering from that operation.
1. Quan dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet
it is customarily called gout by doctors. The cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body cause joint pain, and the feet are often affected. The swelling in the feet increases over time.
Therefore, it is necessary to start by considering the foot in which the cold humors are thick and not another type of swelling. You should then collect that sable.
And is it that you command the patient to hold their leg up, and suspend those veins above their head as much as possible; and this one of subtle duplication according to this form?
And these two onci are gradually raised in a cup according to this form.
And they are then tightly closed around those subtle veins, with subtlety, and remove the sand hour by hour, until you see those veins becoming more moist from the swelling and becoming reddish.
And make sure you do not touch the swelling at the ends of the stump; and if your operation is done under the sun, and there are no other veins, then keep your operation closed until those veins are filled.
When you have completed, then you must distill in the cold well or roof that is closest to the wound so that the coldness of it may reduce the pain that is increasing.
If it is not possible to obtain all of this in one day, and you must apply it to the pain that causes the pain for several days until the pain is reduced and you are sure that there will be no relapse of gout.
And repeat this over the other hand when it is cured.
And this is the form of the forceps:

And when it is discovered that the bone is inside and sometimes in the corruption or blackening, you should cut it with a tool of this kind:
It is called a hard cap, and it is made of iron, and its shape is similar to the one that is cut by points of lima or aliskalfati per punctacio subtil (as shown in the following form).
Then place that over the corrupt part of the bone, and rotate it between the fingers, and press your thumb gently as you know that this cropy is being sawn.
If it has some cracks, and then restore the place caused by dehydrating and tightening agents.
Then if the place is consolidated and good flesh grows on it, and the body of the sore and painful part is separated from the corpse in 40 days, and it is not renewed or healed, then you should know that it is cured.
However, do not enter the wound unless you reduce the fissure to the shape of a nose, and follow this method: and it is that you will discover from second to second with iron or sharp medicine, and when you discover the bone, then you hold third in this form:
When the external part of the horse's shoe is cut off, it should be cut as many times as possible within the extremity of the toe.
Then place it over the bone, and make it the lacrimal; and along your thumb, and a little of the flesh, and open your hand and all the bones that enter until they penetrate the whole bone, and it will feel the pain as if it were burning with fire.
Then restore the place with medicinal cathartics that are drying as you need to.

This malady which is called gout is not but a disease which is adjusted in the wool like water descending and not that one.
The greatest labor in the work is that you make the malady seize on the cloth that is worn and dyed, and then press the head so that it is in your hands of two parts and dry that which comes out of that part where you see the gout reach the parts behind, and it should be dry and not descend, and the lum should be left, and this malady would see its causes as they were.
If it does not come down below, you know that it is wet.
If the descent is not prepared, as they have said, you will have to cut the urethra between your own thighs and then insert a thin pin subtly and above all, place it over the cornea of the eyeball in the eye socket (within the located area), enter if the suture is not tightened.
If the suture is not tightened, you will have to distill water in the tail that you have mixed with water and honey, in which you have already built honey and honey.
And if the cure is not found, then enter if it is healthy.
Chapter 22.
Of the cure of the wet coming from the tail.
As they have said the specifics of the wet in the division and which convenes to perforate, you will have to do that for the health.
You must make sure that you cut the urethra between your own thighs over a chair and the honey tail, the strong one.
And if you pause a little below the eyelid of the eye that is causing the pain, if the one that causes the pain is the left one; or if you pause a little above it, if the one that causes the pain is the right one.
And if you hold the eyelid of the eye that is causing the pain with your thumb, if the one that causes the pain is the left one; or if you hold the eyelid of the eye that is causing the pain with your index finger, if the one that causes the pain is the right one.
And if you pause the end of the thumb at the top of the cornea for the largest part of the ray in the album of the eye that is causing the pain, and if you hold it with your other hand, hold the eyelid up and down with your other hand.
And if you insert your finger into the album of the eye that is causing the pain and feel that the thumb has already passed through due to the pressure.
And if you measure the size of the thumb at the corner of the eye that is causing the pain and see that the measure is equal to the distance of the pupil inside the end of the furrow, and it is the cornea of the eye; then you will see the pupil with the clarity of the cornea.
When you arrive at the location where the poison is located, and then you place your hand on another part of the body, and if the poison descends, you will see the leg that has been affected by the poison, and you should immediately stop the treatment.
If you repair a little; therefore, if the poison descends, you should immediately stop that other vein that has not been cut off.
When you are safe and have not descended, you should immediately extract it with ease, and remove as much as possible, and dissolve in clear salt from gum a small amount of water and wash the wound with it; and stop or soak or infuse into rose oil and albuminous serum and ligua to cleanse the wound.
We know those who are of our time who pause over that which has been consumed from the albuminous serum.
And if you do not obey my advice to treat the wound for its hardness — which is common among men whose skin is hard — you should know that this is the form of the sponge that I recommend, which is called alberid and looks like this:
When you have pierced that joint, do not last the hole in your arm, and if it does not come out, then make a small cut below the surface.
Then enter the medicine according to what they have said.
You must prepare the complement of your work, which is placed on the thighs of the patient in a dark room, and is prohibited for all movements.
Then pause the gout in nature so that it is lined with its own nature and does not cause the hand to go to the right or left of the whole.
And make the limb according to its position on the third day.
Then leave that in that dark room and expel the visible flame, and make it see some causes, and return the limb on the seventh day.
And do not force the gout in the hour of the priests or too much the infusion. It is necessary that you give the gout to it with water that falls on it with great and violent regard.
If an abscess occurs near the skin, it is necessary to open it, as it will release its contents within seven days and can be corrected if needed.
Do you have the patient's consent to examine their mouth and throat for the next few days, as it is necessary for the treatment of their illness?
And if their speech becomes less clear and they speak slowly due to their condition, it is necessary to seek medical attention.
And you know that in alchemy, there is no excuse for the disciple's lack of vision, and you must be careful with the operation.
And it has been discovered in our art that some of those who are alchemists, and alchemy says that a fire is made in the Airy magazine with the substance that succeeds the water.
However, I do not believe that you have seen this in our land, nor has it been written by any alchemist of the ancient times; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species of Aquarius that are over those, which do not know those:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. The tips of these needles are made of iron or steel, and their sharpness is achieved through a triangular cutting edge, with the sharp point at the extreme end, similar to that of a knife.
Capitol Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh in the nose.
When in the nose there are various hardenings of flesh, some of which have a certain cause that is similar to that of scorpion sting or polyp peys; and this malady is called polypus, which is similar to the one represented by that peys. And of the hardening, it is cancerous tissue, black in color; and of the nose, it is that the flesh of a lion is not of a dark color.
Therefore, in that which is in these hardenings of flesh, the lion's flesh is not cancerous or malignant, and it is necessary to make the malady seize between your hands and place it on the sun, and humidify the nar in those hardenings. When extracting that part, and approaching it as you have understood from the fine gout of that part within which you know that the whole flesh is remaining; if Roman of that cause of the which the abscess is possible, then you should take that as one of the subtle instruments for facilitating entry into that which the Roman understands of that cause. If Lord may sin or accident have happened to the cautery, then you should pause at that place; whether it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you cut and cauterize that within which is sanctified and the whole cavities are remaining.
And if it be in the nose that it has been inserted, then see where it goes and how it agrees or disagrees with you. If the nose is opened and there is humidity within the palate, then you know that it has been healed.
If the humidity does not follow after that place, then you know that there is nothing in the flesh of the bones of the nose which has not been permeated by abscess.
Therefore, you should cover the part of the body where there is any swelling, wet it with a soft cloth, and pause between each portion of the said or mens, and then open the thigh and insert an extremity of the foot into the arm or another cause that may be possible.
And suppose that this has been done, that the sweet odor of it permeates the canals of the arms, and is placed over the child's groin, so that many eyes see this action made on children in schools, and there is no cause for that which he wants to do.
And then pause the two extremities of the foot, one that goes over the nose and the other that rubs on the nose, and then apply firm pressure to the flesh of the feet that are in the foot, and make sure that the flesh is already in the feet.
And then extract the foot, and place it in the nose for about three days or more, and make sure that the entire swelling comes out that is rubbing on the flesh.
When approaching the end of the cause, pause in the nose for one night with a piece of cloth to see if it is cured.
If you need medicine, use that one.
This is the form of the instrument used by the barber to cut hair with which are essential oils and medicines in the nostrils.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the instrument should be placed at the end of the cautery and be flat, discovered; in which you will hold it when you scrape the bottom of the foot, with the one that holds you when you scratch with oil or water that you want from the suets and causes suctiblas.
Chapter 25.
These are found in the extra-nasal regions.
Sneezes that are visible are made of these elements in the extra-nasal regions, and they are magnificent and open on certain days until the day that you can see the regard of the eye.
And therefore you have inserted this at the beginning of the appearance of the foot, and you have acknowledged all of it. And then pause over the spot or cautery or medicine that was in place of the one that was needed for the patient.
If the incision is delayed and arrives when it is magnificent, consider if it is being stitched, hard, of black color and with few feelings, do not touch that iron which is called the cranial Apostema; four eyes watch over this Apostema, as it is inserted by the great malice of that which has.
And if the Apostema is of lion's flesh and not black, and sometimes it is possible to incise in all of that, then remove the coyssas and incise that part with fear, and cure the place as it is exsicced and enters when it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Regarding the suture of the nose and lips and the forehead when the continuity is dissolved by pus or for appearance's sake.
Know that when you find a solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, few confirmations are found in that operation but in other people's cases.
Therefore, when you come across any of those causes that you consider to be cold humors affecting the body, and you adjust the lips of the affected area with sutures, and carefully enter that part which is now healthy.
If the lips of the solution for continuity are already separated, and each one is healthy, then you should carefully remove each part of its abdominal cavity within which there is no pain. And if you adjust the lips of the solution with sutures and strengthen those, and over them sprinkle powdered dragon's blood and incense, and place a pinch of consolidated plaster on it, or another of the consolidated plasters, and press that edge for two or three seconds, and then remove that and exchange the plaster and press that part which are the wounds if they have been separated, and carefully enter that part which is now healthy.
The hand that holds the suture is that you add the solution for continuity or as needles have been recommended in the abdominal suture, or add the solution for continuity as you and make sure.

And if that carn returns, insert the second one, and cauterize it, so that the cauterization does not return.

Of reason of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth of the parts of the gums and between the gums that are adjusted with rough, hard, and some veins are of blacks and are painful citrin or verdant and enter that in the gum is corruption and are painful the teeth.
And cover that you make the thighs between your legs and place the head of it in the highest part, and reduce the teeth in those parts where appear those hard veins and causes a semblance of sand within which none of them are similar to any other, and this is of the negro and citrinita and of the others that are mondificated.
If there is still pain in the beginning of the reason, then so be it; otherwise, you will repeat the reason over those parts on another day and the second and third time until you reach the end of what you want.
You should know that teeth require various types of cuts and figures, depending on the preparation for your operation. For so that the razors can reach the part of the tooth that is not covered by the razor, and these forms of razors are those that you must prepare in advance, which you will use the most:
Chapter XXX.
Chapter on the Eradication of Teeth.
Cover that you cure the tooth of its pain with total care and time, as there is no cause that supplies the vein with blood when it is extracted, which becomes submerged within the vein when the extraction is excused in the eradication of the tooth.
Moreover, when the tooth is about to be extracted, you must be certain that the painful tooth is the one that sends the pain through the gum and that it is in a healthy tooth, and you will extract that and if the pain does not cease after the painful tooth and the diseased tooth are extracted, we have seen this during our operations on beards.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When speaking in front of many people for good conversation or to show off, and placing the hand of the patient between their teeth that you hold, and then touching the tooth second with your other hand, which does not touch the other hand, nor cause more pain to the patient.
And if you do not forget, take one of those instruments, and place it at the end of that part with ease and effort to remove the catheter that was inserted at the beginning.
If the tooth is swollen or inflamed, you must cover that part with your hand and gently stretch it to the end of the finger without causing pain in the moment of your compression over that tooth.
And operate very carefully with excision in the circuit of the entire gum part and keep your strength so that it does not touch that tooth and pull it out of place, and return to the patient's leg for the worst pain than the first one.
And be careful not to do what these barbers do in their practice and audacity over the eradication of them, since they do not administer what they have been recommended; four witnesses bring about those very large women who are difficult to treat that are not trinqued, and all their features are improved, or some of those, or that you extract that tooth from the bone of the mandible as four witnesses have testified.
And the elimination of the pain is washed with the mouth or with salt that I see.
If you have any fevers, as seen in the past, then take some quantity of mustard and rub it over the skin, and if that does not relieve the pain, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and tongs should be subtle, as those that cause the tooth to start with long extrusion, thin handle and large, so that they are not bent when you need to operate on them.
And it is seen that the handle is large when you enter and that when you stretch them out they are thin extractions.
And there are points of Indian iron that are points of wide extrusion and in the extrusions of those there are teeth of the kind that some ones have inserted into others and stretched by strong contraction, and some of the extrusions of those are the form of the beak of a goose which has been given the name cicada, it is hard, and they are of strong contraction.
I apologize, but I am unable to provide a translation for "Cap
Translation:
When it is necessary to remove the tooth that is causing pain, you should pause over the location for about an hour or two until that location becomes softened; and then enter with your fingers or hold the extramittats of those that are assembled at the beak of a bird called ciconia or guanta, in the form of forceps.
The first line can be translated as "The symptoms of their joint pain are like a lime or almond." This suggests that the symptoms are similar to those of a lime or almond, but it's important to note that this is a literal translation and the context may
This line can be translated as "And if you do not obey my instructions and use these forceps or needles, then you will cut on the skin and destroy all the flesh and insert the instrument that is called this one, which is a small lever of this kind:". This suggests that the user should follow the instructions provided by the speaker and use the forceps or needles carefully to avoid damaging the skin and flesh. The instrument that is being referred to is not specified in the text.
This line can be translated as "And if it has a thick end and is not hollowed out, then it is not suitable." This suggests that the instrument being referred to should have a thin end and be hollowed out in order to be suitable for use. The context of this sentence is not clear without additional information.
This line can be translated as "Therefore, if the skin is forgotten, then so; and otherwise, help me with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is a triangular extramittance in which there is any thick part:". This suggests that the speaker is providing instructions on how to use certain instruments for the purpose of treating joint pain. The text goes on to describe the form of the first instrument, which is a triangular extramittance with a thick part.
The form of the second instrument is that it is of a triangular shape and has a subtle end point.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And I have other instruments that I will use in shaving teeth; for this purpose, I have made an instrument of the size of this one and it is as follows:
of the rounded end of a tortoise or short, which is any large one, and not curved by itself because it is not triangular.
And you know that these teeth tools are similar to the other instruments.
The skilled artisans and subtle in the art, are lost because they follow what this signifies the operation and different diseases; these are of the diseases for which the ancients did not have or use any specific instrument, due to the forms of various species.
If the bone of the jaw or other bones of the mouth is curved, or if it is swollen, then use your hand over that in its place as follows: this is the convenient instrument and forceps that have been mentioned in the extraction of teeth, and helps you with the handle of which this is the form:
And if there is any large piece small by small, and it is tied or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or leak through which the bone of all has a hole; and then restore the place with the appropriate medical means as follows:
When a small crack is found in the bone, you should identify that crack and its cause, and treat it within the time it takes for the bone to heal.
Chapter XXXII.
Of the treatment of prominent teeth over the others.
When teeth are prominent and do not follow the natural course of the jaw, and especially in women and particularly in religious women, therefore you should consider: if a tooth is nothing else but another tooth, and there is no possibility of extraction or linament, then treat that one; rather than it being annexed to another tooth, treat that one with this instrument of which this is the form; and it seems like it is from a horse's hoof, and is made of Indian iron of sharp extration.
And is your incision at the place where you insert it for many days due to the hardness of the tooth, and not being another part of the teeth.
And if a prominent tooth is exposed to the limb, then make a lima of that with a lima of Indian iron of which this is the form.
When all is said and done, it is all of iron and the marginal margin; and it is made of points that are like needles, those that cause pain in the joints, those that are sharp and pointy, so that no other tooth can be broken or chewed. And then line up those on the face, and use them like razors.
And if a tooth is broken and the tongue is affected, then you must cover that with something like a piece of cloth that has been soaked in water and wrung out, so that the tongue does not become dry and the word does not corrupt.
Capital.xxxiii. (This is a heading or title, not a translation
Restoration of broken teeth requires gold or silver.
When broken teeth are caused by concussion and displacement due to percussion or thrusting, and the mallet cannot be tightened over it that hand, and you have treated that with surgical stitches, and your treatment has not been effective, then you should use gold wire that is not silver, and it will not rust in those that are strong and not silver, for silver turns green and becomes dirty over time, while gold does not change at all.
If the wound is of such a delicate and gross nature according to the amount that can enter between the teeth; and the form of the incision is that you grasp the wound with your hand and hold double of it between two healthy teeth, and as much as possible of the curvature of the wound between the unhealthy teeth, or if one or more, enter when the cloth comes to the healthy tooth of the other part. And carefully insert the dressing into the part of which you began, and tighten it with care and knowledge so that it is not uncomfortable.
If your thread is tight at the place where you tighten the wound, you must cut the teeth that did not escape.
And cut the excess of the wound on the forceps or tweezers, and attach them to any place where you can handle them, and convert those and the hidden ones between the healthy tooth and the unhealthy tooth so that they do not cause damage to the tongue. And make it stand as if it were Roman.
If it slips or breaks, tighten that or those with another thread in the same way for the entire time.
This is the form of teeth and the figure of healthy teeth and rotten teeth, as shown in the following examples:
When it is necessary to return a tooth or teeth to their place in the gum, and they regenerate as recommended, they will remain strong.
And this is not possible without the help of an artist and a surgeon.
Some bones are suitable for the purpose of cattle bones and are made in the form of teeth, placed in the place where the tooth lacks, strengthened as they have said, and remain strong for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the inscription of the language that is found in the tongue and prohibits speech.
This language that we see in the tongue some bones or teeth of an animal that is not natural to the mouth of that man, or accidental and accidental due to the plague that has already been established.
And the operation on this is that you open the mouth of the patient, and it exists there in the upper part; and raise the language tongue, and inscribe that language nerve according to the latitude within which the language of the tongue is released.
When there is any pain or difficulty in that area, and it is for the consolidation of plague, then you should cut and separate that part within which the limb is incompletely separated and the nodosity has been dissolved.
And keep in mind that it is not a joint fissure in the skin of the flesh and that it separates here the tendon and brings out the fluid from the sinus.
And wash the wound with warm water or with cold water or with rainwater; and then place your tongue on the lips; this is what holds the mouth closed in any way so that it is not consolidated by another view.
When you see fluid from the sinus, place your hand over the area that has been incised; when the sinus drains, you should cauterize the area with a sharp pointed cautery that is suitable for this purpose. And that cure is for the other causes within which it is healthy.
Chapter 35.
From the removal of gallstones, place your tongue outside.
When some swellings appear on the tongue, they resemble the small name that prohibits the tongue from performing its natural operation; and more it becomes magnified when it is swollen in the mouth.
The operation in question is that which causes the tongue of the patient to stick out between the teeth and is considered an aphthous ulcer.
If you see the swelling of black or dark color and hard, which the patient does not feel pain in, do not touch that part.
If it is declining to whiteness, in which there is moisture, you should put the cotton on it, and insert a small amount of saliva under it, and insert the whole part; and if you notice at the time of your operation, you should pause for a moment, which is necessary, until the saliva is dry, because it is restricting the suture.
And when you return to your work, if you have washed it with a complement of the part, if it is dry and clean, and cares for that am the other care after this, if it is healthy.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided text is not in a language
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided text is not in a language I can recognize or translate. It seems to be a mix of different languages or symbols. Could you please provide more context or check the source of the text? I'm here to help with information in English.
When you remove the gallbladder from the abdomen, it consists of glands that are assembled like cotton, which become deformed and are known as doxorubicin-resistant malignant tumors. If these tumors have been diagnosed in division and are not healed, then you should consider if the apostemia is hard, of dark color, with few sensations, and in that case, do not touch that with your iron.
If the urine is dark and the bladder is large, do not touch that with your hand for the flow of the sac; rather, let that go inside its mature state, and either you or she will handle it herself.
If it is of a white color, like silver, and the surface of the skin is delicate, then that is what one should cover with a cloth.
The operation in this case depends on the outcome of your operation, whether the wound of the finger has healed completely or if it is still affected by some diminution; then close the leg with a stitch, and the head of the finger should be in its place, and bend the mouth of the finger, and the servant takes between his fingers the tongue of the finger further with an instrument noble of this kind:
If it is made of silver or gold, and it is delicate like silk.
Then when you put the tongue on and show it to you the wound, and cover that with your thumb, hold it there and pull it out of the hole as much as possible. Another thing you should take out of the tunics, and pay attention to that with the instrument of this kind:
Another thing you should take out of the tunics, and pay attention to that with the instrument of this kind: And it is assembled like forceps, but the extramitties are twisted, so that the orifice of any of those is in the end of the other, with sharp teeth, which is of iron ingots.
When this instrument is not at your disposal, insert it into the hole of that substance which is the form of this: If it is sharp for one part, it may be blunt for another part.
And if you have inserted honey, insert the other immediately after this hand-held instrument for insertion, and thus the insertion point of the thigh will be moistened with water.
When there is no flow of blood, wet the insertion point with water, using milk or olive oil as a substitute for the previous causes that entered when the blood flow stopped, and treat it accordingly if it becomes healthy.
And some veins may be found in the other thighs or another part of the same ones, and insert them after those you have mentioned in the insertion point of honey-like instruments.
And if you have already treated a woman with an aphrodisiac that was born in the thigh of her mother, which aphrodisiac tended to be dark brown, with little sensation, which had closed the thigh of her mother, and the woman was breathing straight, and had been prohibited from eating and drinking and water, and had been pervaded by death if not two days or two nights, then insert the honey-like instruments into the other thigh.
The aposteme had already suffered so much that it had made two holes inside that it was bleeding through two cloths.
Then, please excuse me and remain in one of them, and pull out that one, and tear off a piece of it, and take the other part of the large piece, and insert it into the wound of the other injury, and open the mouth of it, and chew on its tongue, and keep the incision in the aposteme.
And then, take a large piece of it, and do not run out of it except for a little blood. Indeed, the gout of that woman is very severe, and she has been drinking a lot of water, so please continue to insert the needle into the aposteme for a long time, and the other aposteme will take its place in that location, which is prolonged in that one.
Then, please heat and cauterize the gout of that woman, so as to add more; and then, please walk around and do not clean what God did in that prophecy.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the text you provided is not a complete sentence or
It seems like you're providing a separate line of text. Here's a possible translation:
When catarrh occurs in the throat, and it is long and narrow, then it is called a "gullet" by doctors; and if it is in the large and round part, then it is called a "bubble".
When the treatment is finished and you are still not cured, and sometimes it seems that the cauterization has already been removed from you and is subtle, then you should think that the intestine has been sewn in that which has been rounded; and if it is at that length, and it bleeds, of a dark color or black, and not to your liking, then you should think that the intestine has been sutured in that, and there is fear of the thigh.
And when you see that the second hand is longer and whiter than the one you told about, and you make the thighs straight and press the tongue with the instrument by which it is processed, and fix it in its place and insert it into one of two instruments, which are called in the incision of two melons.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And after reducing the belly or hernia to its cavity, and placing your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out. And you have already opened the
After making the incision, use the one that has been recommended for the incision of two thorns, and care for that entrance as soon as it is healed.
If the leg were painful due to the insertion of the needle, it is necessary to use an incision in the cauterization of the testicle, and the tip of the cauterist's finger in the testicle should not be anything but sharp and hard, and that you hold the top of the leg with your hand, and press the tongue of the instrument that they have said, and press with the water that they have told in the cauterization capital, and comfort that which is alive, and stop that without being too thick or subtle, and around that fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
When the congestion of the cavity is such that the medicine can be inserted through the vagina, and the patient's thighs are placed on the table, and the mucus is placed on the lips of the patient for the intrinsic medicine to be applied, so that it does not cause any harm to the patient's groin and does not damage the patient.
And if you have the medicine at hand, and apply it over the uvula for the space of about an hour until you see that it is being degraded and dried out by the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take the scalpel and wrap it around the end of the toe, and immerse the scalpel in the medicine, and insert the toe into the cannula that the scalpel adheres to within that cannula, and make as many cuts as you need to get the desired amount of cauterization of the grape, and leave it for three days or four.
And if you order that the medicine be repeated, repeat it, and remove the cauterization by scraping with the scalpel along the circumference of the grape, and modify it according to that amount of medicine that is in the circuit of the grape, and wash it with cold water, and treat it externally with an ointment for inflammation, and disinfect it with garlic if it is sore.
This remedy for healing is placed because it has been incised and lengthened for fear.
This appears to be a medieval medical text describing the treatment of a condition called "uvuola" (which I assume is a typo for "uvulo" or "uvula"). The text describes several methods of treating this condition, including the use of cauterization, submersion in warm water, and application of various herbs and ointments. The treatment involves several steps, including cleansing the area, applying a cushion or support, and holding the patient's hand. The text also mentions the use of a "trauc" (which I assume is a typo for "traucom" or "traction") to hold an instrument in place. The final step involves applying a silver or gold object to the affected area.
This line seems to be describing the application of steam or vapor to the affected area. The text suggests that the steam should be applied to the uvula (the small fleshy appendage that hangs down from the soft palate) until it becomes clear or unobstructed. This could be a method of loosening any mucus or debris that may be blocking the uvula and causing discomfort.
This line appears to be describing the process of applying heat or steam to the affected area multiple times until it becomes dry. The text suggests that this treatment should not be applied immediately before eating, as it may cause discomfort or interfere with the patient's appetite. It also advises that the patient's condition should be monitored closely by a qualified medical professional, and that the results of any tests or examinations should be reported to the treating physician.
If you do not have this instrument at your present time, take a cane and make a closure of the hollow with it, so that the mouth of the wound is covered, as the closure of the hollow prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
This remedy is good for health.

Of extracting spines and of the gout that adheres to the groin and of other causes.
Wounds that are visible adhere to the groin or to a toe-joint or some other cause.
Therefore, it is necessary that you extract the gout that appears on the surface, as seen by the naked eye, and that you first place your tongue on the instrument, so that you can declare to the patient that this is in the groin.
And if the wound is not visible and is hidden in the groin, then it is necessary that you make the patient vomit by inserting the instrument into the mouth, as the food that has been eaten is regurgitated into the stomach; or that you vomit the patient with a handful of oatmeal, or a spoonful of honey, or a bowl of seawater; or take a handful of wet sponge and apply it to the groin, and then move the groin to the location where the spines are extracted, and if you are forgotten there, do not forget. 1. If possible, catch a snake and cut its tail, and then remove the meat carefully; or catch a pig and remove the meat and fat carefully.
If I do not forget the causes that have been said, then you will use an instrument in this form:
When there is a large knot that resembles a small one, and during the extraction of the same, the cavity is easily entered through the opening.
And if the head is elevated on your hand, and keep hold of that part of the head that is near the neck, so that it does not turn away from you, or that part of the spine or the vertebra, or that part which the doctor has placed his hand on.
However, if the patient's thigh is too hard, because of its science of the location of the annexed cause and its repelling force, and pulls your hand away from the instrument as much as possible, according to the amount that is prepared inside when it is forgotten.
Chapter 39.
Of extracting annexed humors from the thigh.
When it is treated with blood that has been said in the division of the cure by doctors and does not comfort, consider if the thigh of the patient's leg is swollen, and that you have compressed the tongue of the instrument that you have recommended to you.
If you see the sign of gout, extract that little or that subtle gesture nicely.
And if it is not possible for you to remove that, then take a concave canula and enter it into the groin of the patient, and place a lit iron in the concavity of the canula, and make as many cuts (as long as the gout is dead and comes from the groin) and abstain from giving too much water to the patient.
And take a full mouth of water and work the patient's mouth in that way, and wash the mouth with that; and do not transplant any cause and give water to the patient an hour later, so that the gout is as it was before drinking the water.
If you do not forget that gout has been recommended, then sublime the groin with cinnamon or saffron using the instrument that has been recommended in the suffumigation of the uvula.
Do this, for four days.
And it is another operation of the suffumigation, for you take a flame in which carbon is burned and the flame is covered with a covering on the top of which the instrument is placed at its extremity; and after the sublimation, pause the groin's mouth at the extremity of the canula, and close the mouth so that the sublimation is not forgotten before you know that the suffumigation is pervading the gout, for the gout to cry out as much as it did before the suffumigation.
If it does not work, you must repeat the subincision motions, and avoid touching the genitals, and eat salty foods and liquids, and do not urinate, and this diet is necessary if this regimen is to be forgotten.
This is the form of the instrument that is used to cut the gallbladder when seen; and it seems like forceps sometimes, but there is no curve in it. The part of the instrument that is in contact with the gallbladder and its end resembles the beak of a stork, which is sharp, in which lime is scraped off when any cause is touched, but it does not hurt.
Chapter 40.
In this is the summary of the discourse in apocrypha and in section of them.
The apostel are special motions, of manual motions, according to which is remembered of them, from each one in this free book.
And they are different in perforation and section of them by hand movements, of which one is for the specialty of apostel in itself put; and therefore that comprehends from the moisture.
E la segonda manieyra es prop les locs en les quals accideys del cos, quar le apostema accident en le cap es autra de la apostema accident en le cul; e le apostema en junctura carnos accident es autra del apostema accident en junctura; e a quascun de lor es son juguament per operacio.
When it comes to the first source sentence, it seems to be discussing some type of medical procedure or treatment involving "apostemas" (which could be a misspelling or a term specific to this context). The sentence suggests that these apostemas are not perforated but rather have a "maturacio de la sania" (maturation of sin or impurity), which implies that they are being used in some way to treat or manage a condition related
The second source sentence seems to be discussing the use of "apostemas" in different scenarios and their impact on the body. Here's a line-by-line translation: When you know the time of the puncture of the appendix, and when it is ripe.
If you know that the pain subsides and the fever ceases, and there is a decrease in the coma and pulse, and the acuity of the appendix head, and the other symptoms.
And when you know that the puncture should be made at the location where the appendix is now and where pus comes from after the curing of the inflammation.
And the puncture should be made at the length of the flesh or heart, if the appendices are in the parts of more or less feet, and in the place of the tendons, nerves, and arteries; and, otherwise, in all places that do not reflect, and in those that do reflect, use the puncture according to that member.
When the appendix is in the flesh, you should more carefully puncture it when the digestion of the next part has been confirmed, as they have said; and if you puncture that denant, the course of the worm's tail and the sordid mothers will be prolonged, and less severe pain will be felt by the endurable labia and the depth of the.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if you administer small punctures, and large ones in the large muscles and tendons, according to their size.
And other parts of the leg where the joint is convoluted and fixed, when it is cut off that which is not necessary, it is done in the same way as that which happens in many doublings and swellings.
And of those that are not cut through, there are three angles; and of those that are cut through, it is done in the same way as the figure of a thorn in a rose, as the knees of the ankles.
And of those that are cut through, there are round and lunate sections, and they resemble those.
That which is not cut through is not like the surface muscles and tendons, but if you make a small puncture in that place, it is done in the same way as a superficial puncture.
When the gout is large and has already collected a lot of pus, which perforates that part and does not let you touch it without drawing out all the dressing at that time; there is one part taken out, and the other side is left with a larger piece, and more are extracted, and they are treated with poultices according to the degree of inflammation that remains.
And if the patient is a loutish woman, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person, then the animal spirit's wisdom is resolved at the exit of the sickness, and more so the wound, and you operate on it.
Take this capital with great caution, and if you make a hole in the place where you perforate those gouts, be sure to cleanse the wounds and consider whether the plague of the gout is small or a flat slice; and if the gout is large, and the fissures of the hole are deep, then you should know that you must pause for a moment in every part that comes into contact with the ensembles.
If in the gallstone it cuts a part of the bowel or is concave, then you know that you complete it like a knife or a thread of string, as when you cut pans or razors, it is wet; and stretch that within the third day; and proceed with that and cure the one that comes out that is sane.
If during your operation you have an accident with blood, then you should administer water and see if there is a string in the one that comes out, and place that over the place where the flow of the visible wound is.
If the flow of the wound persists, then you know that you should administer a regular diet and cure and powder those that I have recommended in the recommended places of this free and divided body.
If it is in the winter season, and the place of the gallstone is located near the nerve, then you know that you should wrap powders in flax and oil, and place those over the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are raw, then you know that you should place powders wet with water and oil or flax and oil, and all of this should be inside the third day, as they have said, and you should remove the gallstone and cleanse that and administer a regular diet to the cure of that which comes out that is sane.
When it comes to the cure of ulcers universally, secondly, the way of distinction has already been mentioned for every type of ulcer, which is the cure by specific means.
Chapter 41.
Of the sections of ulcers that come in the throat.
In the throat of small ulcers, and those of specific types that contain tunics which are their substance; and the specifics of their motions.
And if they are pains, and those that contain moisture resembling honey. And of those that contain moisture resembling polls, and similar to them; and of those that are hard, firm.
And in the section of all, and in the extraction of those which are not to be feared, as the extraction of those does not harm the artery.
And the operation in the section of those is what you should press with the instrument of the kind that is best suited, which is called an enteroscope, and enter if you know it contains.
If you find that there is wetness, then cut the part as thinly as possible according to the length by cutting it superficially according to this form:
Begin the incision along line .B., then enter along line .G. When the wetness is eliminated, cut that part which contains the wetness, and do not leave any cause behind, as many as possible return, if Roman from that cause.
When submerging the catheter into Egyptian water (if present), and if not, into water and salt; and filling it with that plague and leaving it inside for another day, four times a week, this will cure all that is caused by that film.
You should repeat over the Egyptian water catheter according to your doctor's instructions, and if you are confident that there is no cause of that film on it, you will cure the plague by inserting the catheter into the water when it is healed.
And if the rash has large knots, you should insert the catheter in this form: It is not in the form of a groove, and place the warts between the two lips of the groove and the end of that of all parts, and use your skill to extract the tunic that contains that.
If you are not afraid of this, then you will find out at the first time.
And seemingly make the rash's section and treatment according to what you have said; and if the rash's section is thicker, then it has fewer sins and less moisture.
When some people have these types of headaches that cause pain in the head of certain men; the cause is that they have become stiff and hardened over an apostematic point on the head of a woman with a sore and swollen apostematic point, as hard as a deaf stone, rough, bluish, the which could not be made smooth, and if it causes pain in the head, it will cause pain in that place.
In the other headaches that occur in the head, this is not this type of headache, as the apostematic points on the heads of children are like the points of the ears, and the cutting of these all is only superficial.
And stop the cutting of those that are on the lower part of the body, because it is not possible to remove the cause of the sickness from the lower parts.
And cure those that are appropriate for the treatment of that disease.
Chapter 62.
Of the cutting of scrophulas which happen in the chest.
When the joints become swollen and painful, and the knees and ankles are affected, and some people experience pain in other parts of the body, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.
When those have happened in the chest, and those motions that are generated between them, and all swelling from those is due to their own skin, and they appear as in the nodules and papules of the face, and as they have been reported.
The specifics of these scrofula are motions, four out of which are some stony, and the others that contain moisture, and the others that are malignant and do not obey treatment.
In that one you see good disposition in the Tocament, of which the color of water that is manifest is like the color of the skin, and is bad for all parts, and is not connected to the nerves of the chest, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not preonda, because you have not inserted a dry superficial part of the part from the part to the end of the line of .G. within the line of .B., and scorch that entire part, and extend two lips of the skin from onci, or from motz oncis if you need those, as they have been reported in the papules of the face, and extract a little by little.
When there is less caution that the vein or nerve is not pierced.
If the swelling is not great, that it does not press on you, or that calms the leg, and that if it were to be pierced, it would not be necessary to pierce; if you insert the vein or artery and prohibit me from my operation, then stop using the glass vessel or other powders that remain in the sac, clean the vessel, and remove that which repairs the apothem and makes the plaster soft and begins to become porous. When the swelling is abscessed.
Then return to your operation when the dressing is complete.
And if you ask if there is any cause for the other small warts, then pierce those and clean them.
And if it is in the root of the large wart, then do not pierce that wart from its root. Avoid bending that too much and falling into it because of its own harm.
When the wound of the gout is full of pus that you have already squeezed out and found in Egypt, and when you heal it,
If you insert the whole scrofula, it is necessary that you adjust the lips of the wound and take out as much pus as possible without leaving any superfluous part.
If you see that there is excess flesh on the neck due to the large size of the cervical mass, understand that you need to insert the tip of that, and then adjust the suture and this is what is said.
And if that of the cervical mass which contains humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation here at the location of the maturation of the intestine, and stop the perforation so that it does not come out of the belly, as they have said.
And if you adjust the perforation, make sure it is clean and similar to those, so that it does not cause inflammation of the corpse. And if you see that the plague has already been washed, then you cure that perforation with flesh generated inside when it is healed.
Chapter 33.
Of the section of the needle of the aphrectomy, an accident happened to the guillotine.
We cut that section in the epilhot and have not seen any man in our land who did that.
This is the inscription of the Sermon of those.
Many men have asymmetric feet, which makes the removal of the epiphysis difficult, as it is not beneficial for the entire body because all the veins and major arteries of the thigh are here.
Many are those who have screws in their mouth or ear or two ears, when the thigh is not in the canal, which causes a hurry to cut off the epiphysis to avoid loss of the same which is made completely.
Therefore, when you want to cut off the epiphysis, either cut it into three equal parts of the epiphysis circles, or four small pieces by making a slight cut in the middle of the two circles, so that the cut is in cartilage, not in bone, and this place is suitable for cutting, where the flesh and the sinews of the leg are left.
And if the doctor is afraid, then doctors should extend the gum graft to one centimeter, and after it comes into the canal, avoid the veins of the leg if they are not caused by anything.
And then insert the knife as has been recommended; and it signifies over the cut of the canal for the flame which is of that eye which is of the gout and for the abscess of the tooth.
And let the wound be open for some time.
Then when the hour comes in which the puncture is made, add a few drops of the plague's saliva to that, and let that alone sit on the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that make the flesh heal faster when it is healthy.
And Albucasis says that the sum of the speech which has been recommended is not only to see that the feet have become thin, and the thighs are near death, and the breast is cut open, and they will insert the epigastrium there so that it breathes over the place of the plague for some respiration, and it will be saved from death.
And for this I command the wound to be closed after it has consumed the malice of the plague; and it is the malice of it for three days; and therefore I command it thus, and cure that within which is healthy.
When you have seen with your own eyes, as I have, that a certain part of the lung is divided by a cotel and meshed in the gallbladder, and you were called to the patient's care, and examined the abscess as it is swollen, and discovered the plague and purified the sac that was affected by the small plague.
Therefore you have confessed that it had not been punctured by a vein or a wound, and the wind was of the plague, and purified that entrance where the fever had been healed.
And it did not hurt the trade if it did not worsen in the vote, and after a few days returned to the lord's service of his possessions.
And now I tell you that there is no fear in the section of the exfoliation.
Chapter 44.
Of the section over the appendix that occurs in the gallbladder, and is called the hernia of the gallbladder.
This appendix, which is called the hernia of the gallbladder, is a large swelling after the color of the body, and is found in women.
This is a medical treatise written in a language that combines elements of Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The text discusses various medical procedures and their applications. Here's
In the natural course, there is no cure." This line suggests that some conditions are inherent or cannot be cured
In the accidental, there is another maniry (maniry is not a standard medical term, but it might refer to a medical tool or procedure). One resembles thin nodes, and the other resembles apothem (apothem is not a standard medical term, but it might refer to a medical condition or treatment). In that, there is fear." This line seems to describe two different conditions or treatments that are associated with fear. And it does not assume that this force is like iron in that which is small." This line suggests that the force or power being discussed is not comparable to iron, especially when dealing with small or delicate areas. And you propose that and investigate that one as he says, and if it resembles thin nodes and is not suspended in any vein, then you incise that part like the nodes, and extract that from there which counts for it from the skin and bursa; and if not, then you examine all the parts to be sure, and cure the place where it covers the cure as soon as it is healthy." This line seems to describe a medical procedure where a part of the body is incised and extracted, similar to the removal of nodes. The text suggests that the procedure should be done carefully and with certainty, and that the affected area should be cured as soon as it is healthy.
The text you provided is not in Latin, Italian, Spanish,
1. "De seccio de las specias de nodes" translates to "Of the sections of the species
2. "Dels nodes so motas specias e yeu ja he dit totas las specias de lor en la divisio" translates to "Of the nodes, there are different species and I have already mentioned all the species of them in the division.
3. "E cove que yeu recomte assi la diferencia entre node e exitura cum fassa dubitacio" translates to "And it is important to distinguish between nodes and exits, as there may be some doubt about this.
4. "Donc yeu dic que am exitura es caliditat e febre e dolors vehementz entro que es sedada la ebullicio de la superfluitat; e es complida putrefaccio que lahora cessa la febre, la dolor e la calor" translates to "Therefore, you say that exitus is heat, fever, and severe pain that occurs when the superfluity is sedated by the boiling of the efflux; and the putrid matter that stops the fever also stops the pain and heat.
When there is no heat or fever, and there is no pain, and it counts that the lesion is located in the sac of the body, it is customary to call it a boil.
And it is second to the color of the body, and the beginning of it is like a pimple and is made as a cavity like a vase, which is either larger or smaller, and there are two species, one being fat and containing humor, and the colors of the humor are motes, according to what you have said in the division.
And therefore, when you reach the treatment of the boil, you examine it and ask about its beginning at the place called the introme, according to what is found in the head that is nearest to this.
And it is the man who examines and investigates all boils and other nodes, and that you take this introme and enter it into the place where there is moisture in the apostema, and you roll over the points with your fingers as you know that this introme has already penetrated the cavity.
And then your last measure is the size of the apostema, and you extract the introme and consider that it is in the style of the one.
If the dryness of the current is forgotten, regardless of what color it is, you must cut it superficially according to what I have said in the other postulates.
If there is no moisture in the track of the intestine, you should know that it is heavy.
Dry over the cut with this form: As they taught you, and suspend the intestine on that point, and clean the anus with ease, and keep the belt or bag over it, if possible, and take out that sac from the node.
If it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract that healthy one, and you should look for another way, and you must extract it at any cost, even if it does not come out without cause.
If it comes out for a reason or another, few or many, the node returns according to the will.
And if you notice that it comes out from any small part of the body, cut the swelling with some sharp and corrosive powders and strengthen the swelling, and place it over the cushion of the post-operative care, and treat it with another curative remedy within which it is healthy.
If it is a large amount, then you should cut the lips of the patient and treat that as gout that encrusts.
If the pulse is pulsating in the opposite direction, or non-pulsating, then cut and empty the location of the gallstone that is stuck and let it pass through two days or three if the diarrhea persists and the fever subsides; and then return to remove the gallstone that was stuck.
Capital, Chapter 46.
Of the forms of sterilization necessary in section and piercing.
Of those are the forms of the penetrations, and there are three kinds, which of those are the greatest, and of them are the smaller.
The form of the greatest penetration is this:
The form of the smallest penetration is this:
These are forms of iron, of gold, of the ends of branches that are gently cut, so as to not damage the intestines.
This is the form of the experiences, and they are named after them, and one of those is called bridal.
It has three species, four of which are large, more and fewer.
The form of the great experience, the form of it is:
The form of the lesser experience, the form of it is:
The form of the fewer experience, the form of it is:
It is therefore for those wounds, abscesses, fistulas, and swellings that enter those of the bones and from other causes.
And these points are large, like needles, and are placed in the same way as the greatest piercings, and are made of salt, or of iron, or of silver, and the best are when they are made of salt.
And these points are the black plums, which are placed in such a way that for them to be opened, the fistulas in the cavity of those which are reflexions, which are reflected in the levitation of those reflections.
It has three species, four of which are the longest, and the others are middle-sized, according to the size of the fistula and the stricture of it.

This are the forms of the scalpels that are cut and sharp at their edges and used to cut the nodes and the attachments, and they come in three species, four of which are large, medium, and small.
Form of large scalpel:
Form of medium-sized scalpel:
Form of small-sized scalpel:
The cutting edges of those are sharp and the others are not, and they are not placed in that way, but because it is useful for the extraction of nodes to avoid injury to veins or nerves, and for the sake of healing the thigh and bringing peace to a small part through the cooling of that which cools by excoriation, the excision of the attachment.
And these are the forms of plasters, and they come in three species: large, medium, and small, just as you see them.
Their tastes are bitter and the appearance is like that of alcohol.
When it comes to the external incision that was made in the hidden place and in that direction towards the parts of the fingers and thumbs, when you want to, do it as you see.
The forms of spices, which are found between the parts that are not pierced by the needles and do not affect the maladies, and there are three species: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of venesections that are used for cutting the vein and there are three species: large, medium, and small; the forms of it are:
They were made from lemons, which were round in shape and had a certain length, and they were fine.
And it is necessary that you use these species of venesections for large, medium, and small ones, because for those cuts the flow of blood can be stopped quickly in case of need, and at first without medicine.
I do not recommend using those to cut the veins in all parts of the body, and do not use it only in the fleshy parts, as in the legs' changes and chests, and in the mammillas and belly and ears and nose, and it seems like the same as the fleshy parts.
When certain points are made with other small-seeming instruments resembling needles, such as those mentioned above; which are then cut off when performed through liposuction, or you must insert a vein or an artery.
When certain points are made in the form of rounded ones:

Regarding the treatment of male breasts that are assembled from females.
Some points are inflated on the breasts of male patients, and it is necessary to sleep while they start to grow hair, and the breasts are assembled with the breasts of women, and Roman ribbons are placed.
And if you follow this, cut along the line of the .B. to the line of the .G., and remove all the excess fat, and apply the dried medicinal ointment, and adjust the corners of the plague according to the shape of the chest, and cure that which is sick within.
When the breast refuses to yield to the parts on either side and is softened by its own magnitude, as in women, it is divided into two lobes, each of which is raised above the other, resembling the figure of the moon, from which each part contains the other, if that which is the major line contains the minor one of this form of the line of .B. and the line of .G. And the abscess that is between two lips of the ulcer is extricated, the soreness is removed, and care is taken to follow what has been said about the suture and the powders that are necessary in the cure, if it becomes sound.

From the perforation of apostemas that come out from the thigh,
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When those that contain moisture are present; and those that contain moisture are covered and are not cut in the lunar section according to this figure: from the line .G. to the line .B. And as all of it is evacuated, this is the complete outline of the incision and you lay it open the next day.
And if the wound is already healed or is being treated appropriately for this, enter that it is healthy.
And if the incision of the nodes' spears and scrophulas is, and if the scrophulas, you cut over that part as has been said in the section about the scrophulas engagement.
If the plague is extended over that part which is scabrous, you administer this cauterization in it according to what has been said in this section.
Chapter 49.
Of incisions of the abdomen that happen by artery or vein.
When the artery is torn and the coil is consolidated that is over it, then wounds appear on the abdomen. And those which are known to be inflammation and abscess are caused by the artery or vein: four when the abscess is by the artery is longer added in the chest of the heart; and when it is pressed by the abscess into the thighs, you feel in it that it is stridor.
When that which is by vein is made clear in the manifestation of the body.
If the incision on this aphortema is wrong, and particularly in those that leave the thighs, ankles, and collar, and most other parts of the chest; and it is very large, so that the patient's cure may be avoided, and that which is in the extramits or at the head, should be avoided.
Regarding that which causes inflammation of the uterine artery, cut through the fascia in the long way; and then cut the artery on one side and leave the tunics open where it is discovered.
And place over that needle and make it penetrate into the other part, and stretch the artery at two places, — which causes you to have fever in extraction of several arteries that are in the temples.
And prick the place which is between two limbs and let it be exposed where it is in you, and dissolve the aphortema.
And administer cure in which the poison is placed inside the limbs; and cure that which is convenient for it to be inside when it is healthy.
If the wound is caused by vein cutting, you should hold that with your hand as possible for the wound in the thigh, and insert the needle into the place where you have held it so far, and make it penetrate; and it should be in that double part that you extract from the other leg, and tie the wound with a thread as you have been told to do in the grape vine of the two parts of the thigh.
If you fear that you will extract the thread, insert the needle into the place where you have inserted it so far, and stretch the ends of the threads in four places.
Clean the wound in the middle of the place where you have placed it so far, and if you see that it is not clean, insert the needle into the superfluous part of the thigh, and remove what is visible there.
Then place your hand over the powder that you have submerged in vinegar and oil, and administer the cure that is made of calamus and extractent from it when it becomes healthy.

This sentence appears to be discussing the severity of aposteme and its similarities to other medical conditions. The phrase "es apostema greu" translates to "it is severe aposteme," and "es assemblat a la color del autre cors" suggests that the condition may appear similar to other medical issues in the body. The sentence also mentions that aposteme can occur in the major joints and when there is increased vehemence or intensity, leading to a state of shock or stupor.
This sentence seems to be discussing the differences between aposteme and other medical conditions. The phrase "no es apostema agreguat" translates to "it is not additional aposteme," suggesting that the condition is not a separate or separate issue. The sentence also mentions that the problem is not in the chest of the body, and that the codena (which could be a reference to the spine or back) is deposed, and the condition affects all parts of the body without
Therefore, for those who are in the joints, it does not cover that they are wrapped in iron, for if you do, it will cause contraction.
When someone has pain in the head or front of the face, it is called a migraine by doctors. If the wound is small, then cut the thread and pull out that part of the suture.
And if it is large, then cut the thread and pull out that part of the suture, and remove that; and adjust the plug to the suture, and care for that inside when it is healthy.

If the wound of the lip occurs on the abdomen, it is called an umbilical hematoma by doctors.
And if you see wounds on the stomach of those and on other parts of their body, which are similar to those of the fungus, but the size is small and the cap is large; and if the lips of those are conversant, and are small and magnificent.
And if you have seen one and in the abdomen of that there were two that were less like fungus and there was no difference between those white ones with little size.
When the lips of those were reversed and turned inside out, and moisture ran throughout that entire time.
And you insert them into the foot and press it firmly with the other hand.
And the operation in the insertion of them is that you consider it harmful if the thigh is wet, and the color of the skin is white, wet, of a subtle nature; you insert them with a moist spatula, and they are in your presence, and the cauterization is on the fire, four turns of the knife remove the secession of the sanc; and if you see the sanc, cauterize that.
And if you see the thigh is bruised and afraid, keep your hand away from the insertion; rather, do not take hold of recent points, and stretch that skin, the one they have spoken of; and rest it for two days.
And adjust in the constriction of the line of the wound; therefore, do not continue to stretch the large vein in the thigh, until it is cut and hangs by its own weight.
When the belly is large, and there is any cause of fear or pain in it, it is most commonly due to the stomach.
It is possible that you cut the belly, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And treat that part once it is healed from the plague.
And remember that you do not cut into anything that is black in color, of little sensation, and in the region of the leg, as that is where gangrene often occurs.
And you will remember this advice in the future.

Of the eminent cure of the navel.
Eminence of the navel is caused by various motives; or by fissures of the umbilical cord which lies over the belly and yields to the intestine or bowel as in other ruptures; or by sac which flows from a vein or artery as it is said, or by stricture of the gut.
When the pain is in the gallbladder and there is inflammation of the membrane, the color of the aposteme seems to be the color of the chest; and it is felt to be painful, and appears from various situations. If it is for the exit of the intestine, you place its position in that place where they have found it, with less violent diversity, and when you present that part to the eyes, and return it; and more you love it, and it becomes a great sign of the belly's opening and strong labor.
If by coldness, you are a lion and it is not hidden when you present your hand to yours, nor is it tightened, nor is it gripped.
And if it is for the sinus, you place these salves on these places that appear to have the aposteme in black declining.
If by flesh nothing, you are a heavy, large, and hard aposteme that sticks to one quantity.
If by dryness, you touch the part of the lion with your hand.
And the operation in it is that you consider whether the umbilic is for sinus of artery, or vein, or dryness; you cover that you are not allowed in the cure of it, because there is fear and poor advice as you were taught in the capital where I mentioned the aposteme by artery and vein.
When the prominence of the navel is due to the belly or the cloth, you should command that the abdomen holds the desired position and remains extended; and then, with a gentle touch in the circuit of the navel, command that which was inside between your hands on the opposite side, and surround it with salt around the circuit of the navel at the location where you have placed your hands; and extend the width of the abdomen to the parts beyond that; and link it in the circuit with a firm grip or a loose one and the mane of the liar decent.
And then extend the width of the abdomen over the horse and insert the desired one in that point and wants the intestine; and if you have not broken or held it with the horse, then you should extract it and push the intestine to the parts of the belly.
And if you have broken the cloth, then hold that with your hand; and insert the excess of it.
If it is contrary to your arch or vein, then surround that point with your hand and return to your operation; and take two needles and put them in those two firm places and insert two needles into the circuit around the abdomen at the location where you have placed the hands of the crotch, which threads pass; and tighten the abdomen on four parts over the needles.
If you want, remove the beads and clean the area where the flesh is exposed and falls on itself; or insert it when it is subtle and if it soaks up, and properly care for that part which covers the hernia inside where it is healthy.
If the eminence of the navel is flesh or due to moisture, you cover that the intestine has come out as we have said and damaged the sac or moisture, which damages it and properly cares for that part which covers and strengthens the area.
Chapter 33.
Of treating a sprain.
As has been said, in the division, of the kind of sprain and in what manner it is treated by physicians, and that it is curable by iron in so far as it is not ulcerated; and it has been said that sprains are caused by too much or too little exercise and improper treatment of the disease.
And they remove the old ones that some cramps are found in place where eradication is possible, as for cramp that is in the breasts or in the thigh and seems to be in the limbs allocated to withdraw all of it, and especially when beginning small.
When you have been studying medicine for a long time and are skilled, it is not certain that you can cure this patient or that I have ever seen anything like it, nor that it will be successful in your hands.
The operation is made when the patient is allocated as I have said, because you precede and lay out the thighs and purge black blood from some visible parts, and then note that if it becomes severely affected by replete manifestation.
And prepare the thigh in the preparation for the operation, and prohibit certain parts that may concern this; and consider all parts of the body as good for excretion, entering that no cause of the patient's diseases is found. And lay out the sac, and do not remove that part, and expose the locations, and cleanse the sac entirely with your hand or with the instrument you can find among the instruments.
If you have any objection to the sac being inscribed with vein or artery, then cauterize it within which the flow of the sac ceases, and cure it by another cure within which it is healthy.

We have already recommended, in the division, of the spices of gout of water, and the details of each spice, for the cure of the patient by the physician.
When that which is cured is made of iron, it is not merely the specific of althitas alone, and is not approximated to the specific of timpanists or of yposarcha, which is why it is fatal.
E when you have medicated this specific of ydropici timpanistre with medicines and it does not comfort your medication, then consider, whether if the thigh has already been made smooth or another ydropici thigh, as if there is in it or in the belly some toxin or stomach ailment, and then you should guard that you do not use iron, because you fear this.
If you see the thigh of virtue exuberant and it is not another thigh but ydropici so much, and neither child nor old, then the maneuver of the operation of the thigh is that you raise it between your most intimate parts, and the minister expresses the belly of the patient with his hand, and sprinkles the blood at the end of the penis, and then prepares spumous spinos in this form:
The first source sentence translates to: "It should be two sharp points of equal length, with a sharp tip; however, it should not be too short, so that in the operation, it does not enter the intestine, and does not cause harm.
The second source sentence translates to: "And if you consider that the generation of hernias is from the intestines, then you should know that you cut through the umbilicus for three inches on each side, above the pubis.
The third source sentence translates to: "However, if the generation of hernias is due to obesity, your incision should be on the left side of the umbilicus for three inches.
The fourth source sentence translates to: "And if the generation of the hernia is due to the mesentery, your incision should be on the right side.
The fifth source sentence translates to: "And you should not know that your incision is on the side of the abdomen that you want to cut to avoid tearing the superfluous tissue to that location.
The sixth source sentence translates to: "And you should perforate the instrument through the entire codon, and enter it into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the codon and the siphac, and you excoriate that; and if the quantity of a ungla or enviro.
And if you have already drilled the gallbladder through which the pus came out to the desired location, and it is located in the belly. And then extract it and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: It resembles a silver canula; it is made of silver or iron or lead, to which a small loop is attached, and on the sides three loops are attached: two of one part and one of another part; and it is the end of the needle as per the handwriting of a pen, as many times as possible.
And in the extraction of the purulent pus, an armillary sphere is used, which when the instrument reaches the abdomen, you must rotate it around the instrument, so that the pus is evacuated in the amount of time that if you do not evacuate within that time, then the patient may suffer from the loss of the spiritual soul, or it may happen to the five fingers that are nearest to death.
May you evacuate according to the amount of virtue of the patient and according to what signifies to you the dispositions of the belly of the virtue of the polls of the patient and of the goodness of the patient.
And withdraw the instrument, and remove the water that causes it as much as possible, which is held by the ring that is attached to the buttonhole of the one you are about to perform on, and it is recommended to you that you remove this second one.
And repeat the instrument on another day if the patient tolerates it as often, and remove a small amount of water each time, and do this for a few days out of caution, and keep me informed if you do not see any water except a little.
If you fear the patient, and remove a large amount of water, treat it as if it were buried in sand, moisten with soap, and leave it in the sun for a long time; and treat it as if it were dehydrated if it is healthy.
And cauterize on the stomach, and the mass is fitted as close as possible to the extraction of water, according to what I have informed you in water that precedes it.

Of the treatment of children who were born with the locations of the urinary tract not perforated.
When some children complain of pain in the abdomen of their mother, and the head of their mixture is not pierced (or is straight or not in its place).
Then, a pointed cautery is not perforated (or is straight or not in its place) according to this form.
And then pause in the throat a thin wire with a loop, and take it for three days or for fourteen days.
And when urination is difficult and painful; and then return that.
And if you do not pause the wire, it is possible that the urine that was over the place, did not see this loop.
Then, that of which the throat is straight, is treated with a wire of Plum, as has been said, for several days until it is amplified.
Then, those in which the throat is not in its place, are sharp, which causes it to be due to those, that which is born and the head of the tail is due to the lack of a gap in the verge for not urinating in the parts of the belly, after raising the tail to the neck in the parts outside; and it is not of this generation, because so the sperm does not reach the mother secondarily rectified, and it is malnutritioned from that.
The first source sentence to translate is: "E la manieyra de la operacio en lu es que·l malaute sia envessat sobre le sieu dos, e aprop exten le cap de la vergua de lu am la tua ma sinistra am vehement extraccio, e inscideys le cap del cap de la vergua del loc del perpucii am spatum agut, ayssi cum es inscizio de pluma, o que tu ne razas alcuna partida, per so que·l mieg de lu vengua semblant al cap de la vergua e que le trauc caia en le mieg loc segon que cove.

Of the white that may happen in the prepuce of the head of the penis, the glans, and the corona, and the adhesion of the prepuce of the head of the penis.
Wounds visible may happen to this white in the glans, and it is made of fleshy tissue.
And of that one is malignant and another is not malignant.
Non-malignant, cover that you suspend with a fine and cut that part within which the whole world is placed; and place your hand over the submerged cot in the Egyptian marsh; and that one, cure the wound that is inside when it is healed.
And if the white is malignant, of the color, you must cover that you administer cautery at the incision of the part and the root.
If the prepuce of the penis is not circumcised and one part of it is cut off and the other part remains, then you know that you have cut off the prepuce that was left at the beginning until it is consolidated; and when you treat that remaining part, remember that it is not certain that it will not be scarred.
And if already there are signs of gallbladder and blackened prepuce and corrugatedness, then know that you have conquered all that has been denigrated and that is about to be corrupted or corrupted; and apply a layer of this over the affected area, which is contused by the flour of old millet and peas and beans.
And when you treat that, do so in another cure when it is healthy.
If there is no discharge of blood, then you administer cauterization with moon-shaped points in this form:
Four cauterizations are made in two positions, one for the flow of blood and the other for the plague when it is corrupted.
If the tip of the tail is corroded and destroyed completely in an hour, you should know that you need to insert a catheter tube into the prepuce for the purpose of urination for that.
In the attachment of the prepuce to the tip of the penis (and this attachment does not occur except in the one where the prepuce is, and over it there is no circumcission; and when it occurs attachment by phlegm or by abscess) you must exfoliate with a soft exfoliant after the foreskin has been dissolved and the tip of the penis has been completely separated.
And if it is difficult to exfoliate those gently, you must exfoliate with a soft exfoliant on the tip of the penis and the foreskin, and thus the foreskin, when it is very fine, will be perforated by its fineness.
And then separate the foreskin from the tip of the penis by a small amount of its fineness, which is already wet in the water to prevent them from sticking to another skin.
And then apply a cure that is dry within the wound when it has been consolidated.

Of the formation of children and the treatment of that which occurs in those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution for the continuity of the foreskin as with other plagues: but rather, when it is part of our operation and will be done on children, it is necessary to assign it to the best operation and let the surgeons learn from any mistakes that may be made.
In the past, ancient people did not perform circumcision on all free men, as they did not use it in their laws, and this is because they have acquired through experimentation that the major part of artisans and barbers used to circumcise and cleanse, using true skin and true scarification.
And you have already prohibited all these methods and did not improve better cleansing of artisans and barbers, using true skin and true scarification, where the foreskin is hidden, where the prepuce has two layers, and Roman tonic is applied later, and very little is done for another scarification and pain. And the cleansing that is done by alphitis, and is digital, of which they use the scapula, is not secured the scarrification of the end of the male member, where very little is inserted in the wound of the man.
In the operation of amputation, it is very important to use a sharp knife and not to corrupt your operation. When the child's codeine is short in nature, and there are no visible movements in that manner that do not require modification, and you have seen that.
Many of the modifications that are forced and limbs are cut short, which I have observed to be true, and that the sharpness is equal to the sharpness at the end, and therefore, when you present your hand with proportionate two sharp edges, and cut it according to a comparison in time, and the compression of the limbs is the figure containing the coden of the tail of all parts, which does not error for all.
The manner of the first operation is that you make the child stand upright if it is of those that understand a little, which you do not do except when you lie the child on its belly so much only, and that he comes in another day.
And make that joy in all that maneuver that you can receive its intelligence. And make that be between your most statues ready, and not be any fear; and hide the cuts in your hand or behind the child's thigh, so that the child does not see those or use other of the instruments.
And you should insert your hand between the patient's thighs and breathe into their abdomen, and remove any foreign body that may be inserted into the umbilicus, and modify that which is added to it due to impotence.
This is the form of the modifications made to the forfexes:
Some are extramitters that are not talismanic, and the others are talismanic, so that it is not broken the clasp, and it is the length of the acute angles as the length of two manubria engulfed.
When there is an error in the world, it is often because we avoid the intrinsic code entirely, or part of it, and do not inscribe it.
Therefore, it is important that you extend that part of your body to the right side during the examination of the location and that those equal parts are inserted at the second position.
If you cannot hold it with your hand, then extract that part with your elbow and insert it there.
If it has been three days and the abscess is still not discharged from the incision, then you should enter as soon as possible to remove that abscess with ease, and insert the second part that is prepared for you.
And keep the head of the abscess in check, so that it will not be affected by this action.
And cure that part of you which is infected with the powder, using the powders that have been recommended in the treatment of the powder.
If it is inserted over the measure and follows the parts as directed, you will not notice it.
And cure that part of you which has been told to be cured when it is healed.
Capitol 88.
Of the cure of urine retained in the bladder.
When there is retention of urine in the bladder, it is caused by inflammation or congestion due to pears or scars, or swelling and carnification, and it seems similar to what has been said about the hands of those who undergo surgery in division.
If the inflammation is not dissolved and it is very severe on the thigh, then you should cover the abdomen with a cloth over the opening. Then administer an extraction from the bladder using an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the form: It is made of silver and is subtle like a leopard's claw, as it is similar to the sharp edge of a pen in the hand, which is subtle at the end, like a cane made of silk on the cap of the hand.
When the woman is urinating, take the folded hand and place it on the outer part of the hair or beard for good grooming; and enter the extramitation of the hand into the area beyond the ring, and insert it as needed into the forfexes if there is any cause for the hair, less introduce it in the canula with vehemence and then close the ring and the album of the hole.
And place the woman's leg on the pillow, and cleanse the wound with the water of the urine and the washcloth, and with oil of olive and vinegar.
And enter the ring as easily as possible into the opening of the hair; and double the hair at the part of the belly; and press the ring gently there; and press it in as it approaches the vagina, and it should be entered so that the woman does not suffer any harm, and do not force it if it does not fit well.
And extend the hand under the hair little by little until the urine soaks the hair.
When it is necessary to remove that and treat urinary troubles, use a catheter, do not stop until the bladder is emptied and the uterus is relieved of pain.
Capitol .lix. translates to "Chapter 18
Regarding the quality of catheterization of the bladder and the similarity of instruments that are suitable for this.
When there is ulceration or aphthous erosion in the bladder or the surrounding area, or there is a coartate perforation, and you want to draw water and medicines from that, then use an instrument called a clamp cedar, and this is its form:
However, in the removal of the bladder, it is closed. And there are three ways: two from one side, and how many times.
At the beginning, there is a cavity where the urine is collected, and the second quantity that oppresses it is added, and when any cause is removed from that drawn-out urine, it is expelled, and when it is expelled, it is expelled, and when it is expelled long, the clamp cedar is used, which is phosphated in the battles of the sea.
When you want to prevent moisture in the vagina, insert the end of the clitoris into the moisture, and apply it as much as possible to those parts that are affected by the moisture, so that the moisture is applied to the cavity of the clitoris.
And insert the end of the clitoris into the urethra according to what has been recommended in the cringing; and apply as much moisture as possible to that moisture, so that that moisture penetrates deeply into the vagina, and the thigh is centered on that.
The form of the cringing by which the vagina is cringed, and that form is:
If it is made of silver or gold, of the cap which may be similar to a small pen, and then the canal liquefies.
And hold the vagina tight, and pause in that moisture which you want to cring in the vagina, and apply it between two with great force, and heat that moisture over the fire.
And he pierces the extremity of the thigh into the groin.
And he stretches the opening of the thigh over the groin with wetness, as it has already been permeated by that humidity in the cavity that is located at the bottom of the thigh.
And if you do not have a vagina, then take a gauze and make a circle of that size; and perforate it completely through that opening; and enter it firmly into those tunnels, as it is revolved; and add the circle as it is added alsofatur, so that you can pause in that amount of humidity that you want, and oils and waters.
And then you tie that in the instrument and make it as it was made in the groin, and express it as you expressed in the opening of the thigh, and when the humidity penetrates into the groin, you can remove it.
Chapter 60.
Regarding the extraction of gallstones.
We have already mentioned in the division the specialities of gallstones and their treatment with medicines, as well as the difference between gallstones formed in the uterus and gallstones formed in the groin, and their symptoms.
The text appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The first source sentence to translate is: "E havem dit la peyra en
The translation of the sentence "E la peyra engendrada en la vesica propriament es aquela que es ficada en la vesica" is: "And the peyra, when generated in the true vesica, is that which is found in the
The translation of the sentence "E yeu so narrant aquel am exposicio manifesta e abreviacio" is: "And you say that this is an open and abbreviated description.
The translation of the sentence "Donc dic que peyra engendrada en la vesica majorment ve als enfantz; e dels senhals de lu es que la urina que es eyssida de la vesica es semblant a aygua en la sua subtilitat, e apar en aquela arena; e le malaute fregua la sua vergua, e motas veguadas pen, e aprop es dressada; e am aquo yeys foro le cul en motz de aquels" is: "Therefore, say that the peyra generated in the true vesica directly affects the children; and from the sacks of it, the urine that is drawn from the vesica appears to be water in its subtlety, and appears in that arena; and the uterus raises its voice, and moves its eyes, and is dressed; and thereby, the anus is opened in the motion of those.
When it comes to the care of children who have reached fourteen years of age, and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. In young people, it is easier to tolerate that which is between them.
And of the one from which the stone is larger and the cure is more difficult; And if it is less, it is opposed to that.
Therefore, to reach the cure of that one, begin at the beginning with the examination of the thighs of Christians, from which the whole fenestra is extracted; then that fenestra has some veins prohibited for the prevention of the stone, and you must have the inquisition of Lu.
And if it is near the thighs of the patient's feet and is compact and moistened with such that the stone descends to the opening of the bladder, or jumps from one place to another or some veins.
And make that cezer between your hands as prepared as possible, and the rest of you are placed further with your feet, so that the whole uterus is made to decline towards the parts behind.
And properly prepare that and the entire wound.
If you feel the gallstone in the space, then carefully cut it as thinly as possible over it.
And if you don't cut off the entire foot, then cover that with oil and the left-hand sign of the left hand, if it is a child, or the right-hand sign if it is an adult, and enter that into the right-hand side of the belly. And make sure the gallstone enters the foot as much as possible. And gradually enter that small part into the vaginal opening.
And press over that with your hand, and expel that from the parts of the wound you cut, to the location where you made the incision.
And order the minister to press on the vagina with their hand; and order another minister to extend the fingers on the parts where you cut, and to hold the thread that is left over from the location where you made the incision.
And enter that sponge with the incidence of that, which is the form of it: When the pain is in the thigh, not in the groin, but rather on the left side of the thigh; and the incision should be made over the protruding bone and the one mentioned is in the thigh, and the transverse incision is also made, so that the incision is wide and follows the quantity that I want to remove from the bone, and not too much, for if you don't understand the one mentioned in the thigh, the bone must be cut with the incision, and it is forgotten about its deficiency.
You know that some part of the bone is curved and has sharp angles, which makes the compression difficult for this reason.
And from that part it resembles a gland, and is round, and the easier compression is made for it.
Therefore, if it is that part with the curved and sharp angles, adjust in the incision.
And if it is not forgotten to cut or to hold the bone with gentle force, the end of which is like a finger that you hold on the bone, and do not let it slip from your hand; or if you insert the subtle instrument with a curved end later.
If you cannot find it on that, increase the size of the hole a little, and if you see any blood, cut away the part that has been bitten by acid.
If the stone is smaller than a pea, then at the beginning you push it into the mouth of the bladder and place it inside; and then push a small piece in; and seemingly make sure that if it is less than ten.
If the stone is very large, then you ignorantly push it into the bladder, and a part of it may remain outside the thigh: whether it is dead or alive, due to the continuous distillation of urine, for that reason the place is not completely solidified.
If the expulsion of the stone is not complete, or if it gets stuck in the fracture of the bladder, then use forceps to extract it from inside.
Then when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe leaves and garden earth, and compress it. And place olive oil or rose oil and vinegar on that bandage, or olive oil rosy and water, so that it may be sutured.
When you have put the patient on their side, do not let the limb slide into the corner.
If that happens again, wash the area with warm water and oil, and apply it again today and tomorrow to make it heal.
If pustules appear on the face during the plague, they will become inflamed and red, and it seems that the sanc is in the vagina frozen, and for this the hurina prohibited (and it is known by the excretion of the sanc from urine) must be inserted into the aforementioned plague and the sanc extracted, which if it does not cause the vagina to become carbuncled and putrid, it will.
And wash the plague with water that is agreeable to you, warm and salty, and opposite to all species, and such as is appropriate for your cure when it is healed.
And cover the plague in all the hours of your cure, when you lie down and adjust the medicines that are placed on the spot.
If the stone is small and is in the bladder, and it sticks there, and the urine is prohibited, then you should treat this as I advise you to do when you come to the operation, for too many cases of this treatment have been accused of cutting; and if you have already done so, and you are holding a drill bit of iron in your hand, the form of which is like this:
Then place it at the edge of the triangle, sharpened, and stick it into the flesh.
When you take hold of it and tie it firmly with that thread, make sure it does not return to the vagina.
When you insert the iron into the uterus, it will be easier to pass through that perforator because the perforator will come forward with the uterus. Then you rotate the perforator in your hand and gradually push it into the uterus until it passes through the opening of that part to penetrate the other part; then the urine will be completely discharged.
Then press your hand over that place where the uterus is located on the side of the vagina, where it is swollen, and the urine is expelled, and the womb becomes healthy.
If this cure does not work for you due to any reason that prohibits it from being used, tie a knot outside the vagina, and tie another knot inside the vagina. Then close the opening of the vagina with those two strings. And then remove it. When cutting and modifying the sinew with care, it is made in the plague.
It is not necessary to cut the sinew of the heel, but rather because it does not return to the cavity, and the other sinew also, when it is slid along the edge of the heel, the coda returns to its place and draws the plague.
And therefore it is necessary for you when you have the sinew slid, that you raise the coda to the parts desired, or that you return the second complement, and draw the plague away with it, as has been said.

Chapter 117. Of extracting the stone from the female genitalia.
Stone in the female genitalia that is not produced.
If you see stone in any of those, the cure is difficult for the patient, and it is forbidden by rough hands.
One of them is that the woman fears to see it.
And the second is that you do not find a woman who is scientific enough to dissect if she has been castrated when young, or if she is one of the women who have been mutilated.
The third line of the text is: "E si es necessitat que puntz sia fayt sobre la fassia del pe, lahoras fay am cauteri de punt.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on the heel in women is longer than the location of the heel, so it requires a deep incision, and in that case there is fear.
If you need to provoke pain in your own hand, then you should hold a woman's leg as tightly as possible, and it will not be harmful.
If you are private about that, then hold the woman's leg as close and subtle as possible, or present a mature woman with her feet in the position of the feet, or a woman who is parting from this art in this art.
Then make the presentation, and command the one who does everything you order, from the examination of the heel to the beginning; which causes him to look if the woman is visible, hold that you say in the ass of the one and want the heel.
If it causes fear, then take that away from there and command the one who says that you should insert on that.
If she is not visible, then command the mature woman to enter what you say in the vagina and examine the heel, and hold her right hand on the vagina and appreciate that well.
If it becomes too painful, then cover that part with a warm cloth to alleviate the pain from the orifice of the vesica to the parts near the anus until it subsides and does not return to the anus.
And if you have inserted it into that apposition of the joint of the thigh of which part is at the parada and cent the pea in that part, and he says that it is not worn out by the pea yet, then it is not necessary to replace it.
And the section is not large at the beginning; and then insert the ray over that section, and if you feel the pea, adjust the section according to the amount that you know that the pea is getting out of that.
And do you know that the species of pea are motas? Four of those are few and large, lean and hard, long and round, and have no ramps.
Therefore you know how many species there are of the pea that you signify over it that you want.
And if you see that the stone is coming out, adjust in the place where the glass was cut and take it by hand for an hour until the stone is completely out, and then return to your operation when the pea is outside.
And make sure you prepare for the tools that you need to say in the extraction of the pea in men, so that you can help those in your operation.
If you wish to evacuate the child, and you know that the expulsion of the child is from the uterine canal, then place powder on the spot and stretch that am pulvils and stricture descent, and do not retrace this; and leave the stone and do not extract that, for fear the woman dies. And carefully treat the plague.
When the acuity of the child's pain is reduced, and the place is wetted, then return to your operation when the stone is outside.
Capitol LXII.
Of sectioning an inguinal hernia.
An inguinal hernia is not simply an addition of moisture in the white gut which we leave the coden of the generatives containing the flesh, and it becomes a cipher.
And some veins are in the proper panniculus which is prepared by nature in the part of the flesh, when it is cuyat that another flesh; and it is the coden of the generatives between the white gut which we have said, and it is not known unless tart.
The generation of this hernia occurs due to the destruction of that matter, which is caused to be enclosed in this material, and some times occur due to the impact of points on the genitals.
This humor has various colors, whether the color is red or turns into citrine or blood, or black excrement, or white slimy, and it becomes less.
The remedies by which this addition of water is washed away are those for which it is said: if it is in the white circle that has been mentioned, then the point is reduced to a small amount as a figure of a hoop, and appears on the genitals, where the humor counts that of all parts.
And if the humor is in the proper panniculus, then the point is reduced to a part of the hoop and for another hoop it is estimated that there is another hoop.
And if the humor is between the foreskin and the white circle, then you should remove the feeling.
And when you want to know the color of the humor, you spread the color of the humor on the point in the entrance of which the form is preceded; and then, according to that, what is seen in the appearance of the entrance, judge from that what it contains.
When we arrive at the patient's bedside, you should cover the area with commands that are suitable for the foot, and sometimes the part of the body.
And if you lie down on your back over any cause, and then pause the movement of the clothes.
And if you lie down on the left side of the patient, and command the attendant to follow the right side of the patient, which extends his arm from the hip to the two sides of the chest and the edge of the navel of the abdomen.
And if you take some oil and cut the chest muscles of the patient's lower abdomen, according to the length of the petenilh.
And if the cut is correct, it should be at a distance from the line of the hip muscles, and then enter the white part of the chest, which is understood.
And clean it, and observe, and keep it for yourself so that you do not use it; and your excision is the one that you extract by partida jassia that is suspended in the hand of the patient and gently scrutinize the excision according to the amount you can.
And make a small hole in the anus for perforation, and extract all the water.
And separate the labia of the clitoris from the surrounding tissue, and extend the cipher to the parts below; and do not touch the vagina with your fingers, and insert the cipher in the hand that is as possible. And insert it entirely or in the vagina, and more particularly under the skin, as if you do not scrutinize perfectly the insertion of the cipher, it is not guaranteed that the water will not return.
But if the husband proceeds with the operation of his penis at the time of your operation, when you have completed the cipher section, return it to its place, and adjust the labia of the clitoris with the sutura, and care for that as the others, if it is healthy.
And if the husband is corrupted by another disease, know that you lie about those which are said to suspend him, and extract the penis, and care for it as they have said.
When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if you see that it is an operation, then do it.
And if you want to remove the sand, and enter into the submerged layers of wool with oil or rose oil; and then another layer of wool that you have submerged in oil and rose oil, and expand it over two gathers and the navel of the belly; and then unfold the pleats doubled and powders, and tie them around the one that is next to this form:
And if you want to tie the pressures of two gathers and their woolen folds according to this example; and their points are at the ends where they are pressed with a cotton or damp cloth, and they are added to the structure in the belt of the gathers, and the first one takes the tip of the buttocks inside the two, and the second one takes the end of the pantile, and two extractions over two cushions and two extractions on other ankles, and all the narrowing is adjusted in the belt of the gathers.
In this source sentence, the text is discussing the treatment of a hernia using a form of cauterization, specifically with a subtle cauterizing instrument called a "cutellar". The text suggests that this method should be used on the tissue surrounding the hernia, specifically on the "ginitius" (which may refer to the fascia or other connective tissue). The text also mentions that this method should be used after the hernia has been descubert (discovered or opened), and that the cauterizing instrument should be applied in a specific manner, as described by the doctors. The first line of the text translates to "When it is necessary to use a letter in Greek." This could
Then make a hole in that cipher, and it will ignite when all the moisture is outside." This could be interpreted as a description of a process or tool used to create a mark or symbol using Greek letters or other characters. The phrase "ignite" might suggest that the process involves some form of heat or fl
Then extend the cipher arm out, and scrape it out, and scrape out the cautery underneath; and inscribe the second one within you as much as possible when you have eradicated all of it; and keep this from the fire that it does not touch." This line seems to describe a process of carving or inscribing a symbol or mark onto a surface, possibly using a cautery tool. The phrase "eradiques tot lu" could mean "eradicating all of it," suggesting that the entire symbol or mark is being created. The final line advises caution to prevent the fire from damaging the inscribed mark.
And you know that this operation is safer and longer lasting than cutting." This line suggests that the described process of carving or inscribing a symbol or mark is preferable to cutting, as it is safer and has a longer-lasting effect. The use of Greek letters or other characters in the operation may contribute to its perceived safety and longev
If you have any disagreement with cutting or cauterizing at the time of operation or during cauterization, or with using suture, then you should know that this is not recommended for you. Instead, follow the advice given to you." This line advises the reader to follow the recommended procedure for the operation, regardless of any disagreements they may have with cutting, cauterization, or using sutures. The use of Greek letters or other characters in the operation may contribute to its perceived safety and longevity.
When the patient's thigh is painful and does not hope for the second operation due to its horror, then administer the second dose as you recommend; and when you are certain that you understand, that this hernia is painful.
It is necessary that you place the patient's thigh on an elevated bench, then make a hole in the flesh at the lowest part of the swelling, and stop the drilling after the length of the bone.
And if the hole is wide enough to let out all the pain.
Then place your hand over the area and hold it there, so that you can let out the painful part. And take care of that until the wound is healed.
When the pain is opposite to the eclipse of the hernia at that time, then do not do it except for this: and that is because the white gauze in the wound causes contraction and prohibits the inflammation of the hernia, so you must place in the wound a needle or instrument of the kind from which the hernia is extracted from the hernia, in the form that precedes; or adjust in the compression of the wound a small one.
You are aware that the urine returns, and it is excreted in approximately six to eight months; and when it is added, you should be perforated according to that menstrual cycle, as the uterus will pass through those days.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you've provided is not in
This line seems to be discussing a section on treating a hernia and its cure. However, without more context, it's difficult to provide a precise translation. Here's a possible
This line suggests that there is fear of danger in the section about this hernia affecting larger parts of the body; however, it was observed that the patient has been discharged and is expected to be saved for the better. This could mean that the hernia was not severe enough to cause significant harm.
This line seems to be asking if you remember the operation in that case and the specifics of the surgery. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a precise translation. However, it appears to be discussing a specific surgical procedure related to the
This line seems to be discussing the cause of the hernia, which is said to arise from the bodies of those in whom the genes are combined and is caused by various causes: either acute superfluity, which is disposed of in the genes, or by percussion. This could refer to a surgical procedure where the excess tissue is removed from the affected area.
This line seems to be discussing the color of the hernia, which is determined by the color of the skin, and does not become atrophied in the pain, and is a severe hernia. This could refer to a hernia that is larger and more serious than others.
When a post-operative swelling is large, of a dark color, and does not respond to treatment, it is called an abscess.
Some wounds are caused by the penetration of arrows, and by inflammation of the tissues already perceived as a result of the injury, or by inflammation of the veins.
It is believed that inflammation of the wounds is caused by the spreading of the swelling when you touch that part with your hand; and it does not matter if it touches.
It is believed that inflammation of the veins is not caused by any cause, but rather by the compression of the hand when you touch that part.
It is possible that this special wound is a cut and on the other parts; and it is that you insert the code of the genitals, and extend the blood to the parts thereof, and extract that from the white part, and separate the suspensory of the vessels, and tie them, and inscribe the suspensory push that you extract from this total part of the parts of the wound.
If the flesh has already become solid in those hardened parts, then you should carefully remove the flesh and leave it exposed.
And if there is adhesion between any cause of the phlegm, or between that which is between the abdominal walls, then you should carefully remove all of that adhesion and leave it exposed with a round incision.
If the tissue is naturally present at the location of the adhesion that is behind, then you should carefully remove all of that tissue and leave it exposed as has been said.
Then when your operation is complete, fill the wound with a mixture of lint and olive oil and red wine; and apply this to the other cure as it is healed.
Capitol LXIV.
Of the surgery for hernia that is of a vent.
Vit is a post-operative swelling that occurs due to an envelope-like structure similar to the mollification of the testicles, and it is difficult to move and walk on the thigh.
When treating this disease, there is fear of the cold that precedes it.
However, we should mention operation in the second part of the first sentence.
And say that the disease is best treated on an elevated table; and raise the suspensory of the testicles to the parts left; and tie the codon of the genitals at the baysels that are shown to the vergua; and hold onto those other ministers that you, and extend them vehemently.
And insert it with cold humor through the perforation on the right side of the vasectomy when the vessels are discovered.
And extract from all parts as much as you have said in the extraction of the uterus, which are in the templates.
And fix an agulha in which there is a double fibula, and link it to the first of the locs in which the vital parts are found, and link it to the other watched at the end of them. And insert them in the middle location through a second perforation after the long one of the body, and extract that which is added with the fetulent and corrupted humors.
When treating the plague, take care of the other plagues in which you want to be conceived by those who cause the waters that do not rise from two genes, for it is not harmful for this reason.
If you happen to lose all your hair, it is believed that the testicles are dried out or that the testicles, due to this condition, are not nourished by the vessels, and they are dried up, or that they are fixed in such a way that they do not function properly.
Chapter 65.
The Cure for Intestinal Hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that extends over the abdomen from the front of the abdominal wall, causing the intestines to be pushed through the opening made in the abdominal wall.
And this rupture is either of the abdominal wall or of the intestines, and they are affected by these specific causes: blows, squeezes, clamoring, elevating any heavy cause, or resemblances.
And the symptom of this, when it occurs due to the extension of the abdominal wall, is that it happens little by little over a long period of time and does not stop, and the patient suffers from coughing up blood into the throat because the abdominal wall compresses the intestine.
When the symptom of gout appears in the toe, at first it causes severe pain; and from then on, different parts of the foot appear to swell, and this is due to inflammation of the intestine, and the cause of this is that the intestine is damaged in the areas affected by gout.
And some parts of the intestine are forgotten by the foot, and this hernia is called entestinal.
And some parts of the intestine are caused by inflammation, and some parts of the foot are found in the toe area, and here they are held back, and there is great pain and discomfort in the thighs, and some parts cause severe pain when pressed.
And in the treatment of the symptoms of this disease, iron is feared because it may be escaped by the caustic in that.
And the tool for the operation of this is that you command the patient to lie down on the table with the foot in the cavity of the intestine if it obeys the return of the sieu, and place your hand over the sieu col between the patient's legs, and raise the changes of the intestine.
When you approach the abdomen, which contains the abdominal muscles, and insert the needle into the abdominal muscles at the desired point, and then fix it in place with lips of the incision next to the second one that indicates to fill the incision with something suitable for it.
If the incision is smaller than what you can comfortably handle, then the wound may be forgotten.
Then remove those cords that are placed on the abdominal muscles, entering if the white, hard cord of any part is discovered.
Then enter the needle into the hole that is in the testicle, in the hole that is in the white cord, which is placed on the abdominal muscles, and then into the second white cord, and release the adherence that is in the back of the wound.
And if you see that the abdominal muscles are cut, and then extend the white cord to the left side, and lift the wound up to the incision; and command the minister to extend the wound and you dissolve the adherence that is behind in the completed solution.
When you ask if the patient's abdomen is not covered by the white, hard hip bone, it means that there is no cause for concern regarding the abdomen being covered by the hip bone. This statement is simply stating that there is no issue with the abdomen being covered by the hip bone. If you suspect something else, then place your hand on that part of the abdomen.
And then you should cut into the part of the scrotum that is further away from the testicles, as it has been recommended in the past that they have said.
And then apply wool that has been dipped in oil and rest on the plague; and apply the ligament that has been recommended (and some white veins have been cauterized, which have said about the incision of the gall bladder, where four veins have fallen) and stretch the ligament inside so that it does not come out.
If the pain of the gallbladder is delayed, then apply cold water to the tail, and rest on it inside so that it does not come out as has been said.
And then cure the plague with another cure for the plagues inside which is healthy.
Chapter 66.
Of venturesome hernia.
In this hernia it has not been seen that it was strained during the cure of the patient with iron.
And the first thing that was said to be done as it has been recommended in the hernia that is made; which is to cut as it has been told on the section over the ease of the patient; and to dry in the middle of the area in the environment of the apothecary that I have given, inside which the vessels come out, if they fall.
When the plague has been cured according to what they have said that it is cured,
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in a
I apologize, but the text you provided is incomplete and does not contain the phrase "Capitol .lxvii." Please provide the complete sentence or context so I can assist
This line appears to be a continuation of the previous one, discussing the cause and effects of a condition in the ankles. However, without the complete context, it's difficult to provide a precise translation. Here's a possible translation based on the given line:
When you do not give the children any cause for their bellyache; and if you do, it is very little; and return them to their cradles in all hours.
If the time is prolonged as much, a slit is made in the abdomen where the gout enters that causes the bellyache; and it happens that the abdomen extends too far, which is caused by the extension of the abdomen, and it becomes soft and the place where it is inserted swells and comes out.
And the cure for it is a cautery that is preceded by the narrative of it.
And some wounds are cured by iron following this method: and it is that the patient lies on his side with his feet towards you, and the place of the emergence of the intestines is cleaned and cut by the heat of three degrees.
And then tighten the white belly that is below the navel where it is discovered.
And hold the ray and place it over the place of the emergence of the abdomen, and press that on the belly.
And then, approximately center the prominent hip bones over the end of the leg's thigh bone, and adjust one of them to the other.
And then, remove the end of the bone, and do not cut the thigh bone in total, nor extend the hernia, nor any other cause as you will know in the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
And then, cure that as in the treatment of diseases, and when you cut the wounds, cleanse and restore the hernia within what is solidified; for the thigh bone is contracted and not adjusted to the prominent break.
And cauterization is better in this place, where it is pushed for health.
Chapter 88.
Of the softening of the testicles' cord.
Observed motions of the testicle cord in healthy men are softened by heat, as the flesh that is within that area is softened, and the appearance of the gaze is improved.
It is necessary to apply that which is prescribed in the treatment of the thigh that causes pain after exercise, and cut the entire cord that is softened over the natural cord; and then adjust the lips to the suture.
If you wish, in the beginning, the excess of the softened codon is three cuts or four and is fastened with a suture.
And insert between the sutures; and properly care for the other diseases that are inside when it is healthy and clean the wounds.
Chapter 69.
Of dismemberment.
You know that dismemberment is excommunicated in our law for the reason that I remember it in this free book; and it is not necessary to remind it except by a few tools, of which one is the one that I have in my science of surgery when I am buried in it, knowing the treatment of the animal to which it belongs; and the other tool is that we should have need of dismemberment of other animals for our purposes, as for motors, and mouths, and pigs, and pork, and like animals.
And then say that dismemberment is done in two ways: either by cutting, or by making a slit in the cut.
In that which is called a strain, the way of the operation is to make us carve out the beast in its tail, coming inside those parts of the body that are softened and bound and hanging down. And hold those by your hand inside where they are loose and not seen from the outside touching.
In that which is called castration, it is necessary to have the beast and press on the sac of the testicles of the other side.
And tie those, and insert over each part where two parts are processed by cutting.
And insert those plugs that will have to be extracted. And do not put anything over those of the phallus except the subtle one that is over the veins.
And this method of castration is better than the one that is made by straining, for in straining there is often a cause of the testicles due to the beast wanting to fight.
And cure the plague inside where it is healed.
The text you provided is not in Latin, Italian, Spanish,
I apologize for the confusion earlier. The text you provided is in Latin and it is a medical treatise about her
The text you provided is in Latin and it is a medical treatise about hermafrodozia in men. It states that the second sign of hermafrodozia is when water appears in the space between the testicles, and within that space, there are four female genitals.
When some people have pain in the urinary tract that is located in the testicles' chain.
In women, it is a special case: it is that the woman's humor is located over the pecten, as if two testicles were present in a man, a few centimeters apart, at the end of the penis, as the perineum of a man.
The cure is of three kinds: from two men and one kind of women. It seems that you have inserted those adjusted parts within which the decay of that is expelled, and that you cure those other diseases with the same cure.
And in the second kind of men, where urine is located that is in the chain of the testicles, there is no cure or operation in it.
Chapter 21.
Of lengthening and embellishing due to the causes of women.
Lengthening is much admired when it is natural and is made more legible with the regard; and some parts are magnified in some women to such an extent that they spread as in men and pass through the act of intercourse.
When you have enough flesh on your arm or on the other, insert them into the incisions.
And do not end too early in the incision, rather in the first layer of skin, so that it does not leak serum.
And keep caring for that part until it is cured after being healed.
The most difficult scar is the one that is inside the thigh, and it is often very painful to touch, and it heals slowly like the first wounds of childbirth (and for this reason it was called "childbirth scar"); therefore, when you cut, insert your finger as you insert the flesh, and care for that part until it is cured.
Chapter 72.
Of curing gout.
Gout is when the man does not have a hole, or if it is too small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to the disease that preceded it, and it is made or by unsuitable skin or by a small and thin gash.
And it is made or in the prepuce of the penis, or in the folds of the scrotum, or in the bag below the penis, or in the bag above the penis, and forbid sexual intercourse and masturbation, and most of all, forbid ejaculation.
If the pain is caused by watching the moon, if the menstruation is apparent, then; otherwise, you should close that with your hand, either with your fingers or with your thumb.
Otherwise, if the menstruation is due to a slight secretion in the labia, then you should close that with your hand, and then loosen it.
And if you place your hand over the labia silks, and then pause the fingers on the indicators of the most common parts,
And the woman is on the bed, the thighs spread out, and then extend the labia as far as that slight secretion is broken and the menstruation is flowing.
And hold the wool and apply oil to it, and then place that over that location, and wait for the day when that location is not solidified.
When the cipher is large and dense, you should cover that area with either salt or mirth.
If the operation is by flesh, then suspend that area under the hand, and insert it.
And if they have medicines that stop the flow of their painful bites, use as much as possible, and dried ginger, and stitching, and needles, adjust the album of your hand.
And provide a wide-mouthed bucket for the purpose that the plague is not solidified.
Hold it by the handle and administer cool water to it.
And when she is cured, apply that other cure for consolidation as soon as she is healed.
If some things happen in the other animals of other species, then cover that area with this method. If it is for cranial aphasia, then in the cranial area that is not affected by contrariness, use iron in this method.
Capital. Chapter 73.
When it comes to the treatment of hemorrhoids and red blood that occurs in the female genital area.
Hemorrhoids are appreciated of the openings of veins that are continuously in motion and are often found in women. And they are called hemorrhoids because they are throbbing.
And I have already said in the division the specifics of those and their seasons, and direct which ones receive treatment and which do not.
Therefore, say that hemorrhoids and throbbing occur when the hormonal changes occur and do not appear in symptoms, and there is no need for treatment in those cases.
Most of those that are on the opening of the female genital area where the pain is felt, are those that have been treated.
And do you cover the woman with warm water and extend the legs at the feet or over the shoulder, and insert those in the holes.
And you should powder over those the fluids of the womb from one of the powders that are inserted, and it is similar to the way it is on those.
When pressing the affected feet for about an hour, and then rinsing them with cold water.
If the flow of the wound persists, then apply this ointment made from summer, honey, and coriander seeds, and similar substances.
And then take flour of oregano and honey and mix it with water, and make a plaster with it on the back of the patient.
If the wound separates, then so be it; and if not, apply two tapes to hold it in place, and scrape off any excess.
And then take wool and submerge it in the oil of collodion or the oil of arnica or the oil of guaiacum, and apply it to the affected area and hold it in place; and cure the area so that it heals within a short time.
And cure the area so that it heals.
Chapter 74.
When a puncture or laceration occurs in the most intimate part of the body, it is considered an accident.
Specific types of wounds frequently occur in the most intimate part of the body, such as cuts, ulcers, erosions, abscesses, hematomas, fistulas, and ruptures, as well as other wounds. And I have already mentioned these afflictions and the specific types of those and the treatments for them in the division.
And I ask if you are asking in this book about the wound that occurs in the most intimate part of the body when the wounds become sinful, and if you want to know how the operation of the iron is made.
And I ask if you consider that the pain of the wound in the beginning is acute and caused by percussion and flexion, and sometimes it encircles and if one looks over that feeling, no cuts are made on the wound, and care is given to that part as soon as the sharpness of the accidents ceases.
When you have covered the female patient with a cloth that has holes; and recline on your side and adjust your buttocks to the part where the previous stitch was made, and your thighs are expanded, and pause your knees near your thighs, and lie down in a way that is convenient for you.
And the midwife followed the right side and administered the instrument that was used to open the birth canal, in the form that will be found in those causes that you will make.
When you want to administer this instrument that you make from the rabbit's gallbladder of the female patient, and the instrument that enters the woman should not be more than the gallbladder of the rabbit and lead to the thigh. If the instrument is larger than the gallbladder of the rabbit, then you should cover the pulvis on the texture of the gallbladder of the rabbit so that the insertion of any instrument into the gallbladder of the rabbit is prohibited.
And you should cover the string that runs through the instrument of the lamb and hold the instrument while turning the string until the birth canal of the woman is opened.
When the inflammation appears, and it is touched with the hand and the eye, and the nose, you cover that with your hand to prevent the disease from reaching the head of the patient.
When the sore is evacuated, you cover that you pause in the bath a submerged machine in olive oil or red oil in which there is any stitch; and pause the calyx in the section in the pre-on of the larger.
And pause the gum of the larger and over the wet hair that is submerged in water in which are built the masses.
And it is cured in about two days when you find that it agrees with this and comes out that it is healthy.
And some wounds are washed with the gum of the larger and the bath in which is crystallized in water and honey, and in water in which is built bullfight or long-sleeved aristocracy, and returns to the enguent.
And if the bath is cut in the gum of the larger, you cover that you have forbidden from the cure of the patient, having cured that one with this that they have said in the division.
I apologize, but I cannot provide a translation without the full context of the source
This sentence seems to be discussing the role of midwives in assisting with childbirth, and mentioning that the doctors are not present during this natural process. Here's a possible translation:
A necessary cause is that the midwife cuts open the figure of the natural fetus at the beginning for signs of it, and when you see the woman express her parts and desire to smell the air, and over that is removed because over it is the part, and quickly the labor pains of the child are felt, you know that this part is a second natural figure, and is the labor pains of the fetus on the head, and the next is suspended or hanging from the umbilicus.
When you see those symptoms, it is necessary to cover the abdomen of the patient so that the umbilicus does not become too heavy when they lie on their stomach, and place the patient on their side, and it should be well covered with good ventilation.
If that which is not a natural part or usable, when the umbilicus is placed on your feet and the part of the body is placed in front of the head of the body and the knees of the body, and it is placed on the chest of the body or on the abdomen of the body, and it is then turned over on the side of the neck, and it seems as if the figures of the non-usable parts are being imitated.
A necessary cause is for the midwife who is wise and subtle in all those causes, and who guards against error and deception.
And you showing the whole figure of those, and which engine is in those for that to be significant and to be there over it.
When the pain is placed on the side of the head by natural means, and that is very strong on the woman and is made in the difficult part, and sometimes the virtue of her is weakened, then do as follows: either the women hold it or she holds it, and evaporate the sweat of her and the oils of the body.
When the woman has entered the menstrual cycle, she should take care to enter the "moon" between the two small and thin sheets or pillows that are on her bed, or she can do it when she is lying down in the bed that is wet with water. And press the belly of the woman when she is sitting down to deliver the child.
If she does not sit down, it is necessary that the woman be crystallized with the mucus of the ptilli and the mucus of fenugreek in the chisels.
And command the woman, the crystallized one, to be broken and to make that stonework disappear; and take her mouth and let her eat it for one hour, until the child is born so that the stone is forgotten as much as possible.
And if the women are more forgetful at the beginning of the childbirth, it is necessary that you reduce those difficulties little by little. If she does not obey the command, it is necessary to place the woman on a pillow and lift her legs up, and place the pillow on the ground; and the woman should hold onto it so that she does not fall from the concussion.
If the hands are not well turned and do not fit, then you should insert them into those and extract the remaining part of the foot or limb from the body, as far as possible, until that becomes equal to the size of the doctor's arm. Then it will be forgotten.
When the foot is on the thighs, you should push those towards them, and convert the foot small, and make it engulf that, and take one of your hands and extend those little by little.
How much easier it is to expel from the thighs, you command that he express himself, and make him withdraw that part in front of the abdomen, which will be forgotten if God wills.
And if it is not forgotten that they have recommended it, then you return the foot little by little into the thighs when you pause that second natural figure, which will be forgotten as soon as the expulsion.
And if it is prohibited that they have recommended everything, then you take muzzle and gum dissolved in water, and rub it all over the mortar with good percussion, and apply lines to this part of the female, the base of the abdomen of the patient. When it comes to that potion in water, if you manage to reach the hypochondria.
When the parts you've left behind become lenitive, then do your subfumigation with mirta and sub-pause at that place. When you've subfumigated for an hour, then put a cloth over a clean dish, and turn and stretch the patient's mouth, take it off, and press the lower part of the abdomen with a soft compression, which will do the trick.
Eyssiment of the foot laterally while one of the patient's hands is held. The engineer is in reducing the patient's thigh, if you cannot reduce it, raise the woman and make her turn.
And if turning does not work, make the patient lie down, and press the thighs of the patient firmly in compression, and apply liniments to the parts you have recommended, and reapply as needed.
And if the child is born, you make the cesarean section on the woman, study the reduction of the thigh, cut off the foot second natural figure, and make the woman turn and order her to understand as soon as she forgets that it is forgotten.
The first line of the text can be translated as follows: When the midwife holds the infant's foot and gently rolls it over and over, and it becomes easy to do so.
And when you have finished, and you pause over the abdomen of the patient who has been recommended oil and mucilages,
And when you command him to make small movements and when he has finished, do so with a cushion and command him to be inclined on his side and to keep it that way, and command him to be compressed; and do so with gentle pressure. The fetus is ready to be born on the side.
When you have finished the second stage of this labor, consider, and if necessary, you may insert your finger into the vagina to see if it is dry.
And if the fetus is hanging out of the mouth and neck, you may insert your finger into the vagina to ensure that it is not retained and is dead.
And when you push the fetus through the parts of the dint, and when you pause the second stage that you have reached, and command the woman to breathe a few times, and if it is not crying, then it is dead or alive.
The first line of the text, "Exitus geminorum aut foetorum multorum," can be translated as "The The causes of this pain are natural and not life-threatening.
When you count those, whether they be many or few, one after the other, and separate them by ciphac, distinguish those entering the ligament in the belly of each of those and some veins that are similar to how a certain fetus is formed naturally, and some veins that are not formed naturally as they have been reported.
And if they are difficult to assess, the child's part must be taken and followed according to what has been reported about the unnatural figures, then you can treat those as they have been reported.
And if the midwife is subtle and wise to understand what is easy, subtle, and late, and to be skilled in every figure according to the one that is prepared by the doctor for the health of the child.
Remembering this that is formed in the matrix from embryos and are aborted.
Some are formed in the larger ones, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight, and ten, and you must already have verified that a woman aborts at six, and another at all forms, which causes a fetus to be formed by measurement of the glorious savis.
When it comes to the science of midwifery, one must know that this is similar to gout, and therefore, it should be treated accordingly.
I apologize, but I cannot provide a translation for "Capitol .l
From the extraction of the fet when it is dead.
When you are treating the dead body that has been said in the division of medicine and it is not deformed, and you have found it suitable to use it for operation, then consider whether the female is of healthy virtue and not of those accidents by which she suffers loss.
When the woman is lying on her back with her head inclined downwards and her buttocks raised, it is necessary to do the following:
The midwife should hold those parts or place them on the bed so that the process of giving birth does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.
And if you moisten the mouth of the older woman with oil, honey, mucilage of aloe and of figs, and semen of liquorice, it will be beneficial.
And apply the midwife's oils and mucilages to the woman, and place ease in her stomach, and surround the part where the fetus is located so that the knots do not tighten.
And choose the appropriate ones: then consider if the fetus is ready to be placed on the head of the woman, and you should keep the knots in the holes of the nose, or in the chin, or in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the beard, or in the shoulder blades, or in the groins, or in the tush.
If the swelling is on the feet of the patient, then apply a poultice or a poultice made from the back of the ribs.
And cover the point with your thumb and hold the curve of the belly in that place which is between the edges of the left side, and enter the umbilicus easily and make sure to leave the thumb in a few places where there are edges, entering as close as possible to the cause.
Then pause and stay in the position of the patient another thumb, or the third if necessary, to make sure it is not too close and does not extend beyond its rectum, but only slightly.
And be careful at all times, so that the edema of the patient is alleviated as much as possible, like in the removal of the disease.
And cover that part where the extension is softened; and if any part of the patient is held, make sure to cover that with your thumb and enter those areas expertly and revolve around that which is held.
Therefore, if the part of the foot is forgotten, make sure the thumbs are moved to enter the place where there is nothing else; and make sure that the entire foot is forgotten.
If the wound is situated under another part of the body and cannot be reduced through articulation, then cover that area with a cloth; and extract that part from where it has been displaced, and insert it either in the joint of the wound or in the thigh.
And cover those parts with cloth on the other wound and on both feet.
If the head of the thorn is large, or it causes pain in its passage through the flesh, or it is the head of the thorn that has been inserted into the mouth of the water, then cover those spines with your hand and remove the water by inserting a instrument called "alundat", which is similar to the other instruments used in the capital.
And if the thorn appears to be large by nature: and cover that part with a cloth or hold it in your hand as they have said; and extract the bones from the forceps.
And if the head is displaced and causes pain, then hold it in place with a cloth until the humidity that is in the chest is evaporated.
If it is not complicated, and there is no obesity, then you should insert the needle as far as it is possible for you.
If the abdomen is distended or is in hydrometra, then you should cover that entrance which is corroded by the water that is inside.
If the feces are on the thighs, then the anus is less and the direction towards the mouth of the child is less.
If the belly is distended and the chest, then you should cover that which is inside the stomach which has been folded over your body, and you should extract the belly and chest through which the water runs that is inside.
If the other members are not visible and you return the needle to the left side of the patient's mouth, then introduce the needle into the right side of the child's mouth, and withdraw it from there with one or two hooks, and insert it into the child.
If the mouth of the mother is cut by postpartum hemorrhage, and it happens to the child, you should cover it with a cloth that does not cause harm to the child; then apply wet creams of humid oils to the child's body. And apply ointments; and follow the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
If the pustule is on the side of the face, you should try to remove it as much as possible; and apply the medicine that was given in the patient's stool.
If it is not possible to remove it, you should insert it into the skin, and extract it.
And make sure that no other cause is causing pain in the following day.
When you have completed your operation, apply the medicine that was given in the postpartum hemorrhage, which caused the mother's wound.
If diarrhea occurs, you should apply waters with tepid temperature and apply the other medicine.
And you have already seen a woman in the belly of whom there was a dead fetus, and placed another focus over the same focus that was given, and the dead fetus is in the other. When suddenly, at a great distance from the city, an abscess appeared on the skin; and it began to swell as soon as it was pierced with a needle, and started to bleed.
And you were called for the treatment of it, and you were treated for it for a long time, and the swelling did not become solid.
Then you examined it from various causes, such as applying strong attractive plasters, examining the bone, and passing your hand along the joint for several days, and examining another bone; and you were too astonished to find any bones in the stomach.
And then you thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Therefore, you squeezed the swelling, extracted the bones from the abscess, the female bones existing in the thighs, which had been cut for a long time, and corrected it with a small piece of cotton.
And you did not feel strange, but rather knew that this is what is known and helps in this matter, that the artificial bone is used for the purpose of maintaining the health of the patient.
When it comes to the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The form of delivery in which the largest part is opened:
This is the form of strangling in which the free ends are closed, where the two ends are tightened at the two ends of two fetuses. However, this tightening may be done with a gentle strap or with a string or a rope.
And the latitude of each fist is twice the width of one, and the longitude of each fist is a palm and a thumb, and in the middle location of two fists, there are two adjustments of those that have already been fixed, of which the longitude is as long as a palm and a little finger, and the latitude is twice the width of one, or a little finger.
And these two additional measures are inserted in the mouth of the largest part so that it can be opened by those when you turn the prescribed straps.
Another form of that gentle and loose tightening:
When the joint pain is caused by hardness of the bones or cartilage, it is called a "fistula" in the same way as forceps. However, in the end, there are two additional cases where the length of those additions is like a palm, and the width is two fingers.
And when you want to open it further, do this: place the female over the bed with her feet hanging down, and open it according to what is between the thighs of the patient. Then open the instrument according to what you want for the amount of appreciation of the mouth of the joint, following the quantity that you want for the meter that passes through it.
The form of what they described in the past:
The form of pushing it with what pushes the foot:
The form of counting the large head in the same way as the joint:
And it is assembled like forceps at the end, with teeth in the extremity, sometimes, and some are made long like forceps according to this form, sometimes, at the end of the teeth, with teeth of interlocking that is inserted and counted. The first line is not in English, so I cannot provide a translation without knowing its meaning. However
This line can be translated as: "Form of an eye does not have a spike." This seems to be a medical description
This line can be translated as: "Form of an eye has multiple spines." This also seems to be a medical description. It could
This line can be translated as: "Form of spatula that has two ends, at which the head is cut off." This seems to be a medical description of a tool used for cutting or trimming something.
This line can be translated as: "Form of two spatulas." This seems to be a medical description
This line can be translated as: "All of these instruments are used, and when you have multiplied the specifics of this and they are prepared by the artificer, according to what is placed in their operation and what is placed for the men according to their quantity." This seems to be a medical instruction or guideline.
This line can be translated as: "And if you do not complete the work of those instruments, then the necessity of those is not excused." This seems to be a medical instruction or guideline. It suggests that the use of these instruments is necessary and should not be neglected.
The first line of the text is not in the same style as the previous examples and seems to be a proper
When the womb is held, you must command the uterus to hold the fetus, and then tightly wrap it with a cloth, and press your hand on the mouth of the child and on its nose, and if necessary, squeeze it gently.
And then, you must take a glove and pierce the cover with a nail, and pause in the area where the mouth of the fetus is located, and insert a piece of cloth that is smooth, rough, bitter, aromatic, and smelling like cinnamon and cassia lignea and Saint John's wort. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the glove, and place it on the fire.
And then, place a coconut shell in the mouth of the fetus and hold it until the vapor reaches the concave part of the womb.
And then, tightly wrap it as has been said, and the womb will expel it quickly.
If the Roman doctor does not see this cure and you command the midwife to submerge her left hand in olive oil or in a mixture of alum, and insert it into the vagina and desire that the woman's companion also inserts her hand there, and as she finds the second one, you hold onto it and extend it a little by little until the first one is removed, then take that small hand out gently, so that the midwife does not close the entrance. It is recommended to be moved to the right and left side of the chest for ease.
And if the mouth of the woman is sutured, we have already recommended this cure for strangulation and medication of the wound of the lips.
If you do not forget all the causes that have been recommended, remember to check that hand in iteration of abstraction, but rather that which is inserted into the mouth of the woman lies in the female's cushion, and crystallize that hand and tetrafarmacon; that will cause that hand to become red for a few days and then dissolve and be forgotten.
When one wishes to vomit, it is the elevated mouth that pours into the throat and stomach, and then the stomach leaks out; and afterwards, it should be properly directed under smokeless conditions and conveniently placed for this purpose.
Many ancient people used to vomit under smokeless conditions with the help of certain herbs and plants.
The form of instrument used to make the woman vomit under smokeless conditions is the retention of menstruation and the second wind.
It is either a view or an error.
And the extremity is paused at the end of the cone and the extremity wide over the fire, and the smokeless condition is placed over the fire's breeze.
And hold onto that entrance while that smokeless condition is consumed and another one is made.
For the cure of the child's non-perforated buttock.
If the children have not yet grown and their buttocks are not perforated, which are already subtle and shiny. Then it is recommended to the midwife that she pierce the child at the place indicated by the subtle and shiny circle; otherwise, pierce the child at the place marked with a rough and hard stone, and make sure not to touch the snake.
And place your hand over that thick layer of fat in the abdomen and thighs; and care for that area as it is sensitive.
If you fear that it will be painful, then stop for a while in the wound with a catheter for a few days, and take it when the child wants to urinate.
And if the pain in the thigh has been resolved due to the consolidation of a plague or an apoplexy; then it is certain that this consolidation is solid, and it should be cured as we have said about the cure and the poultice.
Of the cure of the fistulas that you leave behind.
The fistulas that I leave behind in the part that you leave behind have a low nodal and large ones that are left behind if they are deformed or in the space of one part.
And is it a fistula or vesicles.
And if that node is old and goes from the dryness of the white or subtle humidity to some seen in these fistulas some penetrate.
And those penetrating are connected by the doctor for this reason that it is exposed to those by excretion and wind; and some use the wound of excretion, and much less is it exposed to those worms.
When some of those fistulas are visible in the space that penetrates into the urethra and into the meat of the vagina; and when some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the notch of the knee.
And so it is known whether the fistula is penetrating or not, because you place the end of the tool in the buttocks, and enter slightly with a needle or iron in the fistula when there is no turgor.
If there is turgor, then you enter slightly with a needle or a horsehair in the place where you feel the needle or the hair when you touch the end of the tool.
And if you do not feel that at all and do not proceed with any cause of diarrhea, vomiting, or flatulence, as they have said, then you know it is non-penetrating, and you should take care of the patient.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the urethra or into the meat of the vagina, the meaning of it is that there is an excess of urine in that place and a prohibition of the use of it until that location is consolidated in medicine.
If something penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and end of pain in the circuit, it is necessary to insert the hand here if there is no turtuositat (inflammation) in the bone, and pain in the circuit of the part; and that it can be repaired at any time; and that it does not work in that medicine, nor is it consolidated.
When all those fistulas are not cured at once, and the cure of those depends on the skill of the physicians who will treat them, it is necessary to wait for them.
When there is no penetration and no age, the doctor's advice is to use iron, as you have already recommended, and that which you have already used.
Is it that the patient's leg is over your shoulders, lifting the legs of the patient, and the knees are inclined towards the belly of the patient, and you try to insert the tent into the fistula, if you know where to enter?
And if that sends the patient around the thigh, then cover that you insert the tent as directed in the hole.
And if you feel in the tent that it has already been inserted without being discovered to penetrate, or another that you feel between the tent and the other part, you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on that, because it is not in this treatment, as they have said.
However, they also say that it is healthy for male patients.
And of the medicine by which it is hoped that you improve in that patient, it is that you ignite the cautery subtly according to the size of the fistula, as before, and you insert the ignited one into the fistula when you approach the thigh; and repeat it a few times when you know that all those adjusted fistulas that seem like a quill of feathers of use have been ignited.
When treating joint pain caused by inflamed humors that have infiltrated all parts of the body, and when treating arthritis, use medications that nourish and strengthen the joints. If it is cured, then it is well; but if not, it will not be cured in a short time by another treatment.
If the needle is inserted, and it does not penetrate into the said part of the fistula, and between that and the needle which is made of flesh or cartilage, and sometimes the fistula opens on the surface of the abdomen, then you dry the abdomen from the beginning of the fistula, and if the needle is dried, it is inside the fistula when the dryness reaches the location where the extremity of the needle is, and the needle is released and tied.
And cleanse those fistulous cords that are assembled with the needle of a useless penis and do not harm any cause.
If the flux of the sauce comes several times between you and your operation when you open those joints, then you take the milk that is there and the pus from the instrument which is cauterized with fire or with acute medicine, and the cauterization with fire adjusts good habits: it is the adjustment of those joints adjusted, and the abscission of the sick excretion of humors.
And if you have to care for the inflamed swellings on the border or inside that location, and if you have to cut through the hard flesh to get to it, then you should care for the wound by making it harden and consolidate.
And in those medicines where stitches are used and excised, when the person is restored to health and you do not fear re-treatment.
If the fistula has entered the back of the thigh and is extended into the surface of the skin, then enter the medicine in the thick that was placed in the thigh and investigate it.
And if you find that the fistula has entered the skin or flesh, and is directed towards the penetration, then do not operate on it except by second opinion and hope.
The cause is to be administered in it of three ways: either by cauterizing that swelling as has been said; or by cutting through that which you can manage to reach the consolidation of the flesh so as to enter and cure those parts; and do not process that unless you have not made a cut in the leg containing the wound, and it has happened over the wound of the operation of your will; and care for that as has been said that it may be healed; or by elongating that membrane and taking out that pus which is being cut from that entrance as has been said, or by making a hole in those fistulae which are in the cut and using another sharp-ended instrument to monitor them, and make those holes smaller so that you can percrustate through them; and try to restore the entire plague by cutting, and if the pus does not consolidate, and it ruptures, open the fistula at the end of the thigh, and let it perforate for the wound. When the fistula is closed according to this method: when you insert the tenaculum into the fistula, and around the circumference of the coccyx at the superficial part of the skin above the tailbone and on the margin of the tailbone, you will find that the tenta is perforated at the end, which looks like a needle point according to this form:
When entering the abdominal cavity through one of the incisions or around it, and then attempting to enter the fistula from where it is possible to achieve the convexity of the organ.
If you penetrate the margin of the buttock properly, then take out the intestine from that hole which you have introduced the catheter into the anus; and take out the end of the intestine and adjust the two ends accordingly, and stitch them, and leave it for a day or two, and when the intestine is inserted into the flesh, stitch it at the place where those parts of the intestine are inserted which are between the two ends of the intestine and which cause pain.
And when the plague is cured and solidified,
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrated, then make it penetrate using any instrument that you are prepared with, but do not force it into the pre-hole, so that the catheter does not enter; and then make sure that it is safe to leave it when it is cured.
The form of the spitting spine that is bitten by the fistula: the curvature of which is sharp and the other part is not sharp, because it is not inserted here that it is not necessary, as many times.
Of the suture of embolisms in which runs blood in the insertion of those.
Embolisms are made of two fingers, either between the thighs as if they were made of carbon, or those are like fat. And of those are small and large, and the suture comes from those sometimes and is one, and its motions, and its forearm, and at the ends of it.
But rather those that are the forearm of the thigh are made by the months of little humidity, of which the suture runs clear or a small of sand that is continuous, and it is followed by the color of the skin.
And the cure of that which is cutting the thigh is that you command to the patient that he rests and that he expresses it when the thigh does not hurt and the embolisms appear to you. When you have dressed and securely fastened the bandage or whatever you have around those parts of your body, then proceed to remove those from your own body.
If the bandages are not held on by moisture or softness of those parts, then take hold of them with dry or rough or sharp-edged wool, and extract them from the teeth, and place them over the teeth, and sprinkle some powdery dust over them at the place of cauterization, so that they stick to those parts; or cauterize them after the capillary action of cauterization. And when those parts are cured, treat them in the other cure as soon as they are healed.
If the anus does not comply with excision, you must cauterize the thigh in the place where there is a small bite, and wash it with that water which is in the cloth and which complies with the excision slightly later when the thigh becomes relaxed.
If the hemorrhoids are deformed, their cause is slighter, and it is that you take those from your own body or take those from the bandages, and insert them, and treat them, and cure them with the water that has been said when they are healed.
E aquel que avoreys inscizio, cove que aministres sutura de lor segon aquesta manieyra: pren fiel envolopat e entromet aquel en agulha e aprop extratz las emorroydas a las partidas dessus, e fay aquel penetrar am la agulha en la razit del autra part, e envolveys las doas extramitatz del fiel en la partida pus dejos de la agulha, e so latitudinalment; e estrenh la emorroyda am strectura fort, e aprop noza le fiel e extratx la agulha.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And then pause over the buttocks that are thrust out in oil or rose; and pause that on the thigh and command the patient to pause. And then sew that opening; and when it is closed, cure those wounds or other sutures that are inside and become healthy.
And when those are antiquated and do not work in that medicine, you should know that those are either applied at the point of the stomach or under the tongue, when they are wet and hostile to those that have the scrofula pus, which prevents their consolidation; and then cure them when they are consolidated.
And you should use those that reason with the pus very vehemently when the first entrance is not healed and are excoriated; and then cure them when they are healed.
Understand that it is necessary to massage, and not otherwise if you do not notice any redness secondarily resembling a clavicle on the entire body, and particularly in the areas of the feet and testicles, and therefore for this pain you must rest.
Then, if it is certain that the thumb is in the circuit of the lock, and it is held by the fingers or nails, and it is removed from its place; then care for that.
And if you want, cauterize the following that follows in the head of the screw.
Small warts are an important small rough circular opening on the surface of the skin, and many children have veins that go through them.
And the treatment of the wart is to extend or enclose it, or to tear it apart with what you have inside that box. And if you want, cauterize this, according to what has been said, with fire or sharp medicine.
When a small or large swelling or fistula appears on the surface of the skin, and when it becomes inflamed and looks like ant bites, and then surrounds the area.
The treatment of the wound is to grasp a needle of horn or horn of a tortoise, and it should be firm, and place it over the ant on which you contain the circle of the needle of the parts of the wound; and then rotate your hand over that as it is in the circuit of the ant, and place it on the flesh of the wound, and remove the ant from its nest.
And if you want, make a needle like this according to this form:
The part of the needle that is traced on the cannula should be subtle, narrow (not perforated), wrapped around it so that the learning of the wound is blurred and the rotation of that.
And if you want to burn the ant according to what is said in the cauterization of the ants in the capital of cauterization.
In the form of the instruments that are used to administer anesthesia.
Some of the instruments are made of silver or latex or are melted or ground; and some of the instruments are made of those small instruments that are administered according to their size, larger ones for the treatment of small children's bellies, and for the bellies of those whose anuses are freckled or fissured, the anesthesia from those is smaller.
The form of large and small anesthesia:
The top of the cannula of which the bag is attached to this manner; and in this distinction, the bag is attached at times to the other side.
And the end of the pus discharge, which is inserted into the anus, is narrow (not cut) with a leon, behind in subtlety; and on one side of the labia, and on the other side, there are two openings, and in the other side, there is one opening, and the size of the opening is according to the size of the glans and the penis is small.
When the bag in which the medicines for the animal's bladder or sheep's wool are placed is empty, and the mouth of it is a palm.
When the incision is made through the thighs, as they are rolled up; and if the space that is entered between the largest of the said thighs is the largest.
And if it enters into those thighs, as far as the deepest part of the thickest bone, or around them; and adjust the purse to that part; and when you have paused in it, the purse should be placed at the head of the cistern between two distinct parts of great resistance, and circumcise around each of those thighs: The quality of circumcising around each thigh is that you fill the purse of medicine, which is sewn according to the tolerance of the thigh; and keep in mind that it should not be too long or too wide.
And if the abdomen is lying on its side, and raises its limbs above it and stops one over the one that has been used by men or a pillow, and unties the cauterization from oil or album of honey or mucilage of fenugreek or like; and if it enters into the belly with ease, and the midwife takes the purse and expresses it as much as possible, and is felt when it is evacuated in the entire bowel that is in the cistern; and then remove the cistern and the abdomen raises its limbs to the side.
If the medicine fails to subside, hold onto it as much as possible; and if you doze off for a whole night, it will be worse in the morning.
If you criticize that in the abdominal remedies for diarrhea and the subsidence of the foot pain, you will have to repeat the cauterization when it is healthy.
And if in the anus there are embolisms or appendicitis, you must be the critic most subtle and leon-like among the critics, of those who have the criteria for the children.
In the treatment of the plagues.
And you have already said in the division of the treatment of the plagues that it was appropriate for the free, and you say so that the cure of those who are also good and good for medicine follows the complement.
Therefore, say that the plagues are divided according to which they are caused and according to the location where they are caught.
And the causes for which you see that the plagues are caused are as follows: either due to gout, or scar tissue or cellulitis, or percussion, or thrust, or suture, or resemblance to those causes of motions.
When afflictions are present in the parts of the body as they are in the head, neck, chest, stomach, and limbs, it seems that there are similar afflictions in those parts of the body.
When recommending the cure for certain diseases, one should pause and reason about this rule and others.
You should begin with the simple diseases of the head, where the memory of compounds will come to the beginning of the third volume.
If you find a simple head disease that is not fractured, consider whether it is due to stones or similitude, and if the spine has already been treated, which is only slightly swollen and there are fears of apostemic cautery, you should immediately cut and remove the cranial part as much as possible, and do not delay; and then extract from the side according to the amount of virtue of that one, without any other cause prohibiting fleubotomy, mainly if it is the side that is swelling from the disease.
And if it is the opposite side of the diseased part that is being fleubotomized; and watch the side of repletion and vomiting and large viscera.
If there is any prohibition of the diet, you should be less hungry and not approach meat or fat.
And pause over the wound, if it happens to be an abscess, cut out the pus with a knife, or if it is infected, pour in olive oil or in the one that is antiseptic.
If you are sure it is an abscess, pause over the wound, if it is recent and the weather is not changing, do not apply any powder that you recommend, as it may cause more harm than good.
And if the air has changed, pause over the wound after it is healed.
If the wound is large or is due to injury and infection, and the lips are not adjusted according to the pliers, adjust those as you recommend with the sutures.
If the wound has been exposed to the bone and tendon, and is not held by anything but a small suspensory, insert that and apply medicine to the wound, restore the flesh in its place, and order the thigh to be cut into veins where it is grown: caps and form coys and similar to them, within which it is composed.
If decay has settled in the rotten ribs and does not stick to the bone, you should insert everything possible and then care for it.
If in these plagues an artery or vein of the kind that carries pus may occur, and is not cut off by physicians, you should inquire about the artery, and if it is not cut, insert it into the abscess; and if this causes discomfort, you should cauterize within the sore.
If these plagues are simple and small, the cause is light; it is likely that you powder over those this powder, which becomes solid when air changes those.
And the recipe for the powder is as follows: an olive oil of one part, a sage of two parts, and no-extinct sage in three parts; all mixed and crushed, and the plague filled, and held together by good constriction over that which is on it, and coagulated at the sore.
When applying the remedy to that spot, and not letting it slip while the patient is lying down, so that the medicine does not come out of the patient before they are healed.
And some doctors make a single point, when they are not present and the patient is not in pain.
And this operation is usually performed on the largest pains when they are placed over them and are straight, and recent pains that are close to the patient's sanctuary, where the air has not been altered.
And if the air has been altered, and especially during summer, you will not be able to see this powder in its position, as it does not cure those who have said that you press over those points located deep inside, or that you press over those poles of the flour of the water and honey that gets added; and it cures those who are cured in another way when they are healed.
If the pain is in the bone fracture in the leg and it is small, you should remove this remedy from there.
When I direct the care of the fractures of the head due to gout.
The first line of the medieval medical treatise translates to: "Of the plag
If the disease occurs in the throat, there is no difference in treatment, and between the sore throat and the simple cold.
If the nerves of the collar or artery are already affected or cut, then if it is an artery, do not attempt to cauterize it, but avoid surgical intervention on that part where the pain is most severe, as it may cause further damage to the nerves and contractile tissue. And do not press on the plague of any cause for all the sweat, because the substance of the nerves is sweating and the continuation of it leads to the brain, which is pushed out from all parts.
And if this is treated with unhealthy medicines, then see which water is suitable for washing, some enfused in red or non-red oil, and wash it with the water that is suitable for washing and the other parts with this method, and find humidity.
If the sweat is great, then maintain a suture, or scrape the lips of it, and care for that part as soon as it is cured.
If the sweat is deep or there is damage to it in the low part of the scar, then you should perforate that at its least affected location.
When there is already an artery in the plague and a sanguine flux has occurred, if necessary, separate or dry that artery, tie it, or burn it with a cautery to prevent further bleeding.
If the spondils of the gallbladder have already been inscribed and the veins of the collar are saved, then adjust the labia of the abdomen over the gallbladder's fundus without touching that; afterwards, equalize that and reduce it over its natural figure, and stretch it decisively, and keep it there for the days that it is stiptic and excitatory within which it is healthy.
If the plague has already entered the bone and caused pain, then percuss that, and if in it there are fragments of those, extract all that you can from them; and what is not apparent to you, keep it within the time when the plague subsides, and separate it and the egrecio of the bone be alleujada.
And if the plague is recent, then powder that place with the powder that has been recommended to you. When a fistula is formed in the plague, one should treat it with the same substance from which the inflammation comes to the head of the penis.
If it is a percussion of the anus or crotch, and sometimes of the lips, and you consider that the plague has ventrosity when the thigh enters; you know that the plague is fatal.
And if in it there is not depth and the plague is recent on the head of the penis, you should stop in it for the first hour with powdered bread, and do not stretch that because it is not the sac retained in the depth of it and that returns to the body and that does not cause pain, but stop in it for an attraction, and desire to those eyes that have been seen that day.
And if the attraction is not at your present, you should stop in the orifice of the plague to see what happens because it is water that comes from the humidity; and make the thigh sleep over the plague so that the water runs out that is in it adjusted.
If the plague has been passing for three days or more and there is no spasm or tremor in the abdomen or stricture of the colon, and sometimes other good positions of the patient, you know that the plague is salvable; and then cure that one with calves and the other curative enters when it is healed.
If the cure of the patient is excused and there has been enough time to open it, you know that a fistula has already been made; then cure that one with the head of the capital.
If the plague is due to compression of spasm or colic, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or abdomen, you know that you can cure that one with the treatment that precedes the suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If there has already been an inflammation in the bones and you know that the patient has colon problems, you know that you can cure that one by inflaming the plague and extracting those pus, if they are separated. If they are not separated, you know that you can cure that one by washing the pus with the plague that is adhering to it, which makes its extraction difficult.
When other diseases occur in the other limbs, the treatment for this is the treatment that has been called "gout".
Of the stomach's diseases.
The indisposition that occurs in the stomach is either great, small, or intermittent.
And a small rupture is difficult to repair with another hand, and if it is found that the reduction of them is difficult, then do not hesitate to insert them in their place as much as possible, because they will be engorged and it will be difficult to make the intestinal insertion.
And the better rupture is small, because in that case it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in the special cases of those mentioned.
You know that the suture of the stomach is second to four hands, and fewer sutures are common that correspond to the sutures of other diseases of the body.
When two of the same sutures are used to communicate with other diseases, but not in the abdominal suture.
I recommend to you every exposure and declaration.
When the disease is small and causes the intestine to stick to the abdominal wall for some reason, and it is difficult to reduce it, then you are in one of two situations: either the disruption is not significant as they have said, or when the intestine swells due to cold air.
And when it is swollen, you know that you should soak that in warm water or that you have dunked it in cold water, alcohol, and squinting, and spicy foods, and you should pay attention to that until the inflammation is resolved.
And some people have noticed that it has improved when using only water, and this is better for resolving the inflammation.
And when you notice that the inflammation is being resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which it was hanging for a while, so that the intestine can be reinserted without much pain.
If the intestine of the patient is easily affected by this treatment, then divide the disruption with a small instrument that has been inscribed with bloodless wounds.
The first source sentence translates to: "The first course of treatment is the best, when it is not cut, and is not an occupation to dry out the necessary and excess.
The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin
When the sharp edge of the instrument is inserted into the body, and the blunt edge is not, and the extremity is subtle, and it is not rough like the subtlety of sputum, then it becomes hard to bear a little.
When the plague is amplified and comes out of the belly, you must know that its reduction should be according to the shape of the natural part, in the proper place, if possible, over there, it is better.
When the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the stomach, you must know that you should make the belly lie on the proper back, and stop the changes that are not in the proper place; and if it is in the lower part of the stomach, you must stop the head of the patient and put the piercings in the places that were previously made.
And if it seems that the disruption is in one of the parts of the stomach, you must stop your attention and your consideration for a while so that the part where the plague is located is put in the same place as the other.
And it is important that you administer this to the large and minor plagues.
And in the small plagues, stop that which is in your preparation and make sure that the minister is between your most tightened parts, which holds the disruption as much as possible with its own may and adjusts the lips of the patient, and if it is not sewn, descuebre from there to where it causes another cause.
This is the common suture method: one that grasps the needle, or as many needles as the circumference of the wound; and then releases it from the end of the disruption of that ring, and tightens the needle one, another that you do not lose in the ends of the chain, ends of the cipher that you leave the chain of the parts of the fingers, until that pierces that part; and you have already added the ends of the chain and the ends of the cipher, and so make four orders.
When strengthening the double hem in the circuit of the girdle, and some eyes of other parts are seen, and adding a few more lips and the plague per addition, and laying down the size of this one and fixing another noose on it, and making it as tight as possible on that one, and not stopping until all the compression of the plague is completed.
If the nooses are smaller between roughness and subtlety, four of the subtle nooses should penetrate the flesh slightly; and if they are too large for the codpiece, then for this reason they must be both smaller in subtlety and larger.
It does not matter if the noose is placed at the extremities of the codpiece, because the flesh will not be penetrated slightly and the plague will be discharged before its consolidation.
The stitches are not prolonged for fear that the plague will not be consolidated.
If you insert the ends of the nooses so that they do not pierce the patient's thighs, and place your hand over the suture, which holds the ends of the nooses; and lay down when you know that the plague has been consolidated.
This sentence seems to be discussing the use of needles in sutures for small wounds. The phrase "agulhas en cal manieyra" could be translated as "needles in calf skin," and "plaguas petitas" means "small wounds." The sentence suggests that these needles are conveniently used in small wounds, with at least one needle or thread in the suture.
When the second suture is made: and it is that you administer to the two ends of the sutures, from the codena and the other end of the cipher, in one vein, with a needle in which there is a true envelope engulfed in subtlety and bulk.
And when the needle has pierced these four ends, reduce the needle of that metal part from which you began, so that the true envelope encloses the subcutaneous tissue that comes out, so that this suture is the second suture of the drap am the qual the draps are strengthened.
And pause between each suture the quantity of the large of that said thread.
And this suture stops the men.
And this suture closes the plague that was injured in a man in the ventral abdomen, which had been infected with a gallstone, and was the rupture of the plague of a palm, and was effused around two palms of the palm of the member, and was the rupture in the member; and then you reduced that depressed that the intestine had been for the plague for twenty-four hours.
When the plague has consolidated in the space for fifteen days or more, and is cured, and it heals; and then it becomes firm within a few months, and is discussed in its own categories.
The first source sentence translates to: "However, other physicians had failed to heal; and by miracle, I cured this one who had been in a location where there was no medicine available, as the plague was too severe for any treatment, but I cured him with frequent baths in boiling water and honeyed drink twice a day.
The sentence "Mays yeu diyre dos specias de sutura proprias segon narracio de Paraula" translates to: "Moreover, you have described two types of suture in the second account of Paraphrase
The sentence "E es que tu comenses am sutura de la codena, e entrometas agulha de la partida deforo a la partida dedintz" translates to: "And it is that you understand the suture of the abdomen, and enter the needle at the end of one part to the other.
The sentence "E donc cum la agulha penetra en la codena e en aquel meteys lacertz segon rectetut e en longetut de tot le cos, e layssa la extremita del ciphac en le qual has entromesa la agulha; e fay penetrar en la autra extremitat la agulha de la partida dedintz a la partida deforo en l’autra extremitat del mihat" translates to: "And then, when the needle enters the abdomen and the needles in the sides of it follow, and you leave the end of the incision where you have entered the needle; and then enter the other end of the needle from the other side of the hand.
When you have already made the cut, you will make another one in another direction through the extreme tip of the toe; and then remove the nail from that hole, and make the point enter the other end of the toe into the other side.
And then make the point enter at that point where you made the penetration, which is in the toe, when all of it has entered.
And then start from that side and go to the other end of the toe, where the point of the nail is, and remove the nail from that socket and return it to the socket of the other end of the toe, and take out that from the socket of the other side; and take out that from the socket.
And make another cut and another, and make another cut in the same direction as before, when you have finished cutting everything that is behind according to that example.
And the sum of this suturing is that you cut the skin that you cut the hair, in other words, that you cut the nail one cut from the end of the socket, and that you see that another cut is inside when it is closed.
When the second type of suture is used, which is the one that Gualia prescribes, and this is for the purpose of the surgery and according to the doctor's advice, it is recommended that you use this second semilatus, as doctors usually use this for the entire part of the body that needs it in a convenient way for nature; and they apply the extremity of one side to the other extremity of the other, and this is done in the way that I recommend to you.
Make sure to insert the needle at your own angle in the extremity of the mirror, and let it penetrate into the corner of that side, and make two ends of the cipher; and then rotate the needle and let it penetrate from the corner to the dintz in two ends of the cipher.
And then rotate those eyes, and let each one penetrate into the corner of the dintz from the corner of the part in two ends of the mirror that are opposite to each other.
This suture is better than the common suture, and it is used for the rememoration of the previous one.
This is the speech of Guillaume (William)
This sentence appears to be describing a surgical procedure for a hernia repair. Here's a line-by-line translation:
When there is a tear in the lower part of the abdomen, it is difficult to sew up the wound compared to other parts of the stomach.
The judgment of medicine for the plague is based on other plagues.
The cause of the plague is known when you can recently access the affected area and find that the air has altered there, reducing the bowels and intestines of that region, and making them suitable for treatment. At that point, you should place your hand over that powdering substance.
And if the air has already altered the plague, you should place your hand over that area where the lumps appear that you see entering when they form hard pea and cause the fields to become consolidated and mirated; and apply care to that part as it is the treatment for other plagues when they are cured.
And if you do not have access to medicines, place your hand over that area until it starts to swell, wet, and change the two veins of that day, as it is done for you and taught, when the plague is cured, so that you will not need another medicine in the disposed means when the plagues are simple.
If you fear that the plague may cause injuries to the main members, then cover them with wool dipped in olive oil of good quality, or rose oil, and leave it there in the circuit of the locs that are between the angonas and the thighs.
If you feel pain or putridity in the intestines, then apply four times a day, this will cure the stiptic black herb you have, and especially if the prolapse is entering the intestine and creating an exit through the cavity of the conquavitat.
You know that the one that is from the large intestine is a less effective remedy than the one that is in the subtle intestines.
It is difficult to cure the intestine that is called "gungu" because it does not receive plague treatment that contains in it; and this is due to the great number of veins that are in it, and because of the size of it, and because of its subtlety of nature, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out. And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a
If it has passed through that space and you have already sewn it or blackened it, then what you should do is press on that part with the hand you are holding, so that blood flows come to the area where the veins and arteries are, and that the color returns.
And if you insert that which is another one, and pause the ends of the cord until the part where the gout has passed, so that above your hand there is no attraction of the wound but only the pressure of the skin and the emission of the pus of the plague.
Remember the plague when it happens in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and is small, it may be possible to repair it in most cases, as you have seen that which was once plagued in the stomach, and the plague was an old one and made a fistula, and it was difficult to manage and digest.
When you have finished the cure of the patient, whether it was done in the hospital or not, I will stop being so subtle about the entry that brings health and the location is solidified.
And when you see that the location is solidified, place your hand over the abdomen where you will find the accident of the intestine in the lower belly; and do not find any other accident and rummage through the disposed mouth of the patient eating and drinking, and then enter the bath and exercise in your words.
And experienced ones have already told that when the intestine is inflamed and is small, you should cover it with this way: and that you take large needles; and after adjusting the lips of the abscess, pause one needle over those that are in the mouth of the abscess over the lips of the abscess; therefore, when you press over them and tighten your mouth, the head of the needle adheres and does not dissolve.
And then stop another needle after the first one, and do not stop making needles in proportion to the amount of the abscess.
And if you reduce that and let the plague go; and remove those attached to the intestine when the intestine is healed; and do not cause harm to the thighs.
And if it is possible that the intestine is hidden in a subtle thing that is made from the intestine of an animal attached to it, because it is more like a needle; and it is that you take the end of these intestines, and it is waste, and reduce the end of that intestine's end, enveloping it, and enter it within needles and parts of that intestine, and reduce it in disruption.
And this maneuver of suture is not only the second way of trust and hope.
If the plague is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle intestines, then you will not be able to do anything except subtleization, and it will not be cured for all.
Of cure of abscess and fistula.
You know that all plague and pustule when they are infected and in antiquity, and it is made ulcer, and it is not consolidated and gets the whole arm times and does not separate, you, in whatever member, universally is called fistula and we call it that azukem.
When a fistula is true and hard, white, and free from pain, and it swells as the foot does when it is lame; and for that reason it is called the calf's tendon, that is, the sole of the foot.
It is in the wet part of the human body, which gets wet; and very quickly the wetness is absorbed by some hours. Some of these wetness is bitter, and it is little, and it is heavy, and it is subtle.
1. "When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When you have cut so that you can know the cure for the fistula which is made by way of operation, then...
You will know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; four of those are fistulas that reach the veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the cecum, or the bladder, or the vesica, or to any part of the costal cartilages, or to any part of the vertebrae of the two sides, or to any part of the joints composed of the muscles and the foot; and those that give proximity to the main member and resemble it.
And for these of these fistulas that follow this method are of the difficult diseases to cure, and do not receive cure, and occupation is with that which is worked on and ignorance.
And if any of these fistulas has a depth that does not reach those places that was said, and you hope and trust in the cure of it, and want to know it, then try to pierce it with a needle or with iron, and if the fistula follows correctly, and ask for that which is suitable for it.
If the fistula is tortuous, investigate that which is an excellent means of applying a gentle force, for four drips of that substance will reach the elevation of the left coronary vessel and curve the tortuosity.
If the fistula has many holes, it is not possible for you to understand what you mean about that substance.
Cristenize the wound with your own wound, for the humidity by which you cysterize that one must also be used in the others and curve them.
Inquire with great care, which hand you are able to use if you have bones or nerves, and whether the longitudinal or proximal concussion of the fistula is caused by it, or if it is a fistula for which your strength, endurance, and knowledge of anatomy, and the causes of accidents in surgery are sufficient, and whether the compression of the hand over the location relieves the pain, and whether the significance and causes of the accident are apparent.
When you have examined all those causes, and you see the patient's condition, consult with confidence: and it is that you consider yourself if it is an apparent fistula near the surface, longitudinal of joint, or distant from the joint, or from nerves, or from artery, or from vein, or from one of the parts which you have and say.
When you wet the fistula after it is said to be of the narcissus of the patient, and remain there that which is in that filtration and of corrupt carne, and that which is born in the slaughterhouse of the carne, or of the thigh and semblance, and cure that part which is healed.
If the fistula is of long depth and follows the right course, you should cover it as deeply as possible in the preon while you can, and modify all of your corrupt carne; and administer envelopped needles in acute medicines, and introduce those into the concavity of the fistula which you have understood with iron.
And use some of those envelopped needles in the acute medicine that damages all of what is in the concavity of the fistula of corruption.
And restore those with which you engender healthy carne that comes out when it is healed.
If it is not cured by that, then you should cauterize that after they have been recommended.
If the cause of the fistula is known and you must certify this, you should inquire about it and dry that second part which has been recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or primary member as they have said.
If the bones are discovered and found to be corrupt and blackened, then you should immediately treat that part where the corruption is located; and accordingly care for that area with this remedy that I will apply to that part when it is cured.
If the bone does not become healthy and mobile as it should, you will know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption; and then you will discover the second part and carefully make the reason for the bone's movement and its transformation with the same fortifying tie, and accordingly restore that part.
And if it is cured, well; and if not, you will know that this corruption is in the deep distance of the body, which has not been able to overcome it, and then there is no way for you to do anything but wait for it to heal on its own.
And if the bones are slightly corrupted, or if you can remove that part, then you should remove it with gentle forceps as I have advised.
And if those bones are very small, then you should carefully remove all of them and those that do not cause any harm to your strength.
If you have any disagreement with any cause of the humors, and if there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then you should incise those limbs or bones here, and remove the bones.
If you are not prepared to remove the bones of your hour, then stop over the wound that is bleeding, and let it enter between those bones of carns and limbs, and keep the wound from being consolidated, and make sure the cut you have made in your operation is constricted.
If you fear, stop over the submerged cot on top of oil or Egyptian anguent, or in a cup of green enguents, when they have been separated from those limbs and the bones are separated from them, and that attraction is alleviated.
If you have a great bone that is like the bones of the camba or the thigh, and it is corrupted by the face of that, and only that residue is left behind, which is under that negro and corruption, and you should restore the wound.
If the flesh of the body becomes corrupted to a great extent, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and all other holes that have been made in that location where the corruption has penetrated, and you must treat that once it has become solid.
I recommend that you proceed to operate on a man in his thighs so that the cushion is placed at the highest point and assistants are over your operation.
A young man of about thirty years old fell ill with pain in his thigh, and there were parts of the dough that were hard to the touch on the material of the chest that was pervaded by the thigh, and it was a matter of gout of great gout, and he did not have this cause externally.
And then he extended the time because of the error of the doctors inside where the gout was located, and the matter of the wound was corrected, and his cure was paused inside where the hole was made, and there were some things in it that all got peeled off and the dryness and humidity of the skin.
And then his cure lasted for many years, and he did not know that in the art, when you were called.
And I saw the wound of him and the matter that came from him those things for great chest; and all the body of that man was completely healed and the color of him was citron.
And then you introduced the dough to one of those wounds and it permeated the dough to the bone.
And if you have thoroughly examined all the wounds and found that they reach certain parts of the chamber, then...
And then you carefully covered the wound and inserted your hand over it, describing a part of the bone that was corrupted, already rotten and corrupted; and one part of the chamber had already become corrupted when it had penetrated into the flesh.
And then I understood that this was discovered and prepared by the bone discovered.
And you thought that it was not in the bone but only that corruption which had been cut off and covered, and you had already fallen.
And then I paused the restoration of the plague with conservative medicine for a long time, and it was not consolidated.
And then you continued to explore and discover about the bone secondly after the first discovery, and you found continuous corruption in the bone.
And I understood that this was the cause of that corruption, and you had to perform proper cure and restoration, but it was not restored.
When you found another vein and did not stop inserting the small bones one by one particularly and perforating the restoration of it, and it was not restored until after inserting around a palm of yours, and that extracted from your bone marrow, and then restored that part with medications, and it became gradually consolidated and healed.
And it was not necessary to repeat the operation of the patient and sectioning of the patient unless for the disposition of the body and for the lack of tolerance of the patient and pain from the mort, four times in total due to excessive evacuation of bad sinus without any relief.
And it is cured by complete care, and there is nothing in place of hard bones; and it is good for the disposition of the patient in the body and return the virtue of the patient; and it is discussed in its dispositions and no harm is done in the ambulance or in any other cause.
If the bones are prominent in the body, you know that you have succeeded in this second method: and it is because you hold the thread and tighten it at the end of those bones, and command that it extends those in your hands; and pause that thread from the first thread; and lay that thread over the flesh that you leave the bones, and extend the extension of the thread so that the suture does not hurt the flesh.
When you are ready to perform the operation, pause at the table of the teeth, for it is not forbidden to cut that which does not affect the corrupt flesh.
If the bandage is placed over the affected area little by little, it should be in the concavity of the corrupted bone and not appear on its surface when touched with the other hand. And then it should be tightened.
If the bones are corrupted and not prominent, then continue to cut away one part after another, and the corruption spreads to its final location or to the next part; then discover the entire flesh of all parts; and finally pause there, and secure the first part where the corruption is found, while continuing to secure the other part.
If the securing is done according to the location of the corruption, as has been said.
If the corruption is in the joint, then cut into that corrupted joint and secure the bones where they continue from the other part.
If the corruption is in the continuation of several joints, you will not be in this reason but by force.
If the corruption is in the neck of the arm or foot, it is very difficult; but you must ask which part appears to you as corrupt, and open that, and close it after each position that you can possibly close, and make it rectify itself for you, if not against your will, veins or nerves.
You should know that the types and sizes of the screws and holes for these bones depend on the situation of the bones, as well as the preparation of those bones, their thickness, size, and fineness, their rarity and size; so that you can prepare for all kinds of instruments suitable for that operation.
You know that this operation means on you about the special of the instrument that you asked for; when you have great study and long and careful hands of this art, and witness of hands of diseases, that already you have done these by your hands according to what is convenient for you from the parts of the stitch in all disease.
And you know that at the end of this chapter, the number of the instruments that you will use according to their simplicity and those that you will process for your prohibition, which you will experience on others. Form of serra:
Form of another serra:
Form of another large serra:
Form of ray: The head of this ray should be according to the form of the star-shaped lock, and its points should be according to the form of the iron points.
And it does not seem otherwise that they are cut through the heads of the joints when they are corroded, or is the mouth very wide.
The first source sentence "Forma de razori menor" translates to "Form of
Form of a smaller razor." However, without additional context, it's difficult to
Form of a different type of pain: It is felt as an arch over the part where the edge of the blade touches and the sharpness of the blade, and the member of the body is affected." This sentence suggests that the pain is caused by the pressure of the blade on the body part, which is sharp and causes discomfort. Form of you" or "Your form." However,
Form of the razor in which it has concaved." This sentence suggests that the razor has a curved or bent shape.
Form of another razor that is sharp." This sentence suggests that there is another razor that is shar
Form of another razor with a curved end." This sentence suggests that the razor has a curved edge or tip.
Form of a razor that resembles a tent." This sentence is unclear without additional context. It could suggest that the razor has a shape
Form of another type of incisor." This sentence suggests that there is another type of incisor with a different shape
Form of another type of incisor; it resembles a ray and has a sharp tip, and is displayed in various locations in the bones of the teeth." This sentence suggests that there is another type of incisor that has a rays-like shape and a sharp tip, and is found in different places in the teeth.
The first line of the text translates to: "The form of the bone that corresponds to the ratio of that which is perforated by bones:". This sentence seems to be discussing the relationship between the shape of a bone and the size or structure
The second line translates to: "And its extremity is triangular and sharp-pointed." This sentence suggests that the bone's extremity has a triangular shape and a pointed tip.
The third line translates to: "And it is made of Indian iron, and seems as if all the causes that have been said of razors and scissors and saws." This sentence appears to be comparing the quality or strength of the bone to that of various cutting tools.
The fourth line translates to: "Of the cutting edge and the cramp of the bones." This sentence seems to be discussing the sharpness or edges of the bone, as well
The fifth line translates to: "Whether the extremities are caused by an intrinsic or extrinsic cause, or as you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the medicine does not cure it, or sometimes the corruption arises from a member that does not feel any cause, it seems that you have inserted this member into that place where the corruption has entered, so that the member may escape from there for death or malice that is greater than the defection of the member." This sentence appears to be discussing the causes of corruption or decay in the body, and how certain treatments or interventions may exacerbate the problem.
When the member that is affected is found, it is because it has become black inside because it is what has been burned, or if it can be properly placed inside the blackness that the puncture has made inside that member which then seizes the entire body and grasps everything; and therefore I have inscribed this.
And if it seems that the corruption is caused by a violent blow from some venomous causes, such as from a scorpion's sting or from something similar or from a nettle, and seems so.
And if the corruption or the blow is at the end of the digit, you should inscribe the digit and do not give space for the corruption to enter into the hand.
And if it seems that you reach the hand, you should inscribe at that of the focus of the finger, and do not give space for the corruption to enter into the focus of the arm.
And if it happens that you avoid that, you should inscribe the arm inside the cavity at the joint.
And if another corruption passes and sometimes the cavity is seen, you should in that case be the death of the member; and managing another cause another in curacy is the quantity of virtue.
When the foot seems to have corruption of the same kind as the toe, you should insert it into one of the nails.
If you take hold of the heel of the foot, you should insert it entirely into the foot. If it may enter the hole, you should insert the cushion into the joint of the hole.
If the corruption has already spread over the heel, you should not engage it but release it and let the body die.
The force of inserting the member or clamping it is that you stretch the tendon in the part where you want to insert it, and another tendon above it; and extend the minister one tendon to the parts further away, and extend another minister in its place; and you separate the flesh that is between two tendons, and cut it open from the inside if it is completely discovered; and then you insert or clamp it.
And make sure that there is a pause of dry cloth on all parts so that it does not touch the place where it should be adjusted and postpone the cauterization.
If any bile accumulates when you operate, then you should cauterize the location immediately, or pause it with some powders that restrain the bile; and then return to your treatment once it is completed.
And tie the affected member with a convenient bandage, and care for it within the time it becomes healthy.
And I advise you to go to a man in the country, this accident which you and I have reported, which occurred in the negro in the country due to an adjustment that was made for combustion of fire.
And this corruption first appears in the country when it is entirely applied to the foot.
And then that man prepared himself for his operation by applying pressure to the member with great speed due to the pain and adjustment of the foot, and he immediately entered the joint, and the foot became healthy.
Long time ago, this corruption occurred in the country's method of that indicated member.
And then I won, and so you perforated the reflection of that excess which was stopped over the face of the medicine, the mercifulness of the body; and it does not reflect the excess and begins to go to another place that began in the face.
When the doctor inserted his hand into the patient's groin, and he did not intend to do so out of fear of the repercussion of that superfluousness, and rather than feared the incision of the patient's groin, which was overcome by weariness.
I thought that he would die, returned to his land and found that the man I prepared and incised his abdomen, and was cured.
I have written this account not for entertainment but because it is an assistant over this matter and has significance for what is meant and followed.
Treatment of the sinus and quality of clisterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in the fleshy parts of the body and the abscess is prolonged because it collects sana, and it bursts and perforates and extracts the sana, and the location is identified as if it were a well, and the code that is removed from there as soft as silk, and no corruption is found in the bone or nerve or limb, it is called sinus, and no fistula is formed.
When, however, the space is extended within which corruption presses upon some member, it is called a fistula and is not closed.
The cure of the wound is that it is inserted into that channel as it rotates, and especially when it is finely sliced and made to resemble thread, and is comfortable so that it does not adhere to the location due to its corruption.
If you hope that the channel adheres and that corruption is not achieved by subsequent consequences, and if there is much face in the channel, then you care for that with a clister.
And is it that you consider the sinus, and if it is large, and the breadth that you see is of bad odor, then you clister the medicament Egyptian which is of oil and vinegar and is received in parts equally, and are adjusted on the face within which the medicament is rolled out and penetrates into a specific part of honey.
And then take hold of it as is necessary and dissolve the water and honey in it; and clister the medicament on that sinus, and stretch the incision, and place the medicine in it according to the number of hours.
When it is necessary to extract that member, and it has been softened and the flesh has become thin; then do so for several days until it is fully relieved and the wound is completely healed.
If some sores are covered with ash, and you are not able to present this medicine; and that is because you take the ash from the fire, and put water over it; and then close that and cover the sores within a short time after you know that this intestine has already been cut.
If the thigh does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash of the fire, then close that wound with the water and mix honey with gum tragacanth, and close that wound with the honey mixture, because the property of honey is to cleanse and wash, and the sinu adheres to it, and especially when it has excessive dryness and thirst.
And when you make the wounds and you are sure that the intestine has become thin, then close that wound with the water and make it more tight so that the flesh is rejuvenated in it.
It is necessary to take some oil of rose and dissolve the amulet in it; or to dilute the amulet with some medicines and apply other oils that have the properties I have already mentioned in the treatise on ointments.
If the orifice of the sinus is straight and not received by the catheter of the clister, you should gradually increase that amulet until it is wrapped in an Egyptian ointment or a basilicon ointment, as it is amplified.
If the orifice is wide, you should add the lips of the amulet to the seam and reduce the quantity inside the clister as much as possible.
If the orifice of the sinus is elevated and causes the bowel to contract, you should dry that in a basin located in the area where the bowel comes out, so that the bowel can be returned to its original position before it is inflamed.
If you cannot dry the sinus within the bowel, you should perforate that member am prepared for the bowel according to which it is most difficult and that it is not held in any way by the bowel.
Whatever is over the orifice of the limb, which remains in place for the entire time that it is placed in the bowel. And to know whether the liquid coming from the bowel is much or little, or is digested or not.
And then you consider the location of that limb, whether in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is in its aposteme.
When your medical treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the material adheres to the sinu orifice already, or more firmly, then you hold the wound with your hand or finger, and when you remove the plague, you change the sheet and renew the dressing.
If the sinu has less space and subtle viruses under it, you do not despair of the adherence of it, because the medical treatment is appropriate, because in those who have a slower generation of flesh in these plagues, and in those who have the opposite of this.
And if the sinu has not been well digested for several days, you know that the sinu does not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinu is delayed and is the cause of prolongation, you adjust the medicines in desiccation, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and in their virtue, they become dry as the enguent finally, when it is added to the excess of zegi.
And the more you dare to cure it, is because you take of the enguent finally and it dissolves in olive oil and is over the wounded part which has an antic engual in its substance, and conforms to that, and uses that.
When it seems to be in that way, when no brace is found, then look for a cushion, and use it if it fits well, or take a mirror and hold it up and dust it over the cushion, and place it on the fire and tighten that over the sinu; and place that am the cushion that you have found when it fits well, and dust it over drap and tighten that.
And some wounds are administered in the long-term care of the aristologia and are made with lili celesti (and lili celesti is) and flour and centaurea, and use those simple or adjusted, dust them and rub them over the cushion that I recommended, and close it.
And if the sinu is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, you know that the corruption is in the preon of it, and you should make an investigation in the bones or in the other hard members or ligaments; you should treat it in a curacio fistular as it is said.
Of the treatment of panarici and worn nails and incision of the finger and section.
When the pancreas is inflamed, which is felt on the inside of the thigh or foot, and it is not found in other parts, and when it is prolonged and the curacy is most precious, or it is inflamed by an apostema cautery, or it is corrupted, and it grows between the corroded end of the ungla and the whole, and it greatly corrupts the bone that is inside the toe that smells bad, and the tip of its corruption is at the end of the said lada, and its color becomes black.
And when you have that which has been said in the division and does not satisfy your curacy, then you should know that you are completely insisted on the whole superfluity that is risen from the ungla and apply cauterization to the flesh at that place, for cauterization is not used in such a way.
If the bones are safe and the ungla is healthy, and the addicts of the ungla understand the carns at the parts that are cut, and they begin to push and ledeysso there, then you should know that you leave a subtle ray behind the angle of the ungla that punctured the flesh, and compress it inside and insert it into the flesh easily, and stop over there where the corrosive medicines of the bones are rising; and cure that which is enguentz over there where it is healthy.
When corruption has already set in within the bones, you must cover them with the flesh of the affected part and its surroundings, as none can be healed if the bone is corrupted.
If the pain and swelling appear in the affected area, then you should mark that spot with a needle according to the size of your memory, and carefully care for that part when it is healed.
If there is pain or swelling in the affected area and the pain becomes very intense, then you should cut the thigh at the beginning of the operation, and carefully dry the wound with a cloth soaked in hot water, and make sure that the wound does not enter the flesh that you have removed from the location; and carefully care for that place with a warm dressing.
If the adjustment is not natural, which is common in many men, too much flesh is taken, and too much is left on the bones or too much is left on the thigh.
And the naturalness of the joint is determined by the shape of the joint, or is the origin of the joint in natural bones? If that which is natural in natural bones is not bad, and the one that is natural in joints is too much.
When it comes to those who are born lean, the incision is lighter, and if you are inserted into that part, you must do it with your own hand.
For the one who is born in the joint's angle, the cure is difficult; and therefore, keep away from the abscess of it.
For the one who is born in this place, you must have the nuts; cover that you are inserted at the beginning of the flesh of it, and then insert it with one of those convenient ones, and then cure it inside that which is healthy.
Less consolidation that happens between those that are seen with the visible motions or by the nature of the man who is not yet born, or by the consolidation of plague or by combustion of fire, or by semblance, therefore, cover that success returns to its natural form.
And pause between them the enfuses that are in the red olive per that they may not be consolidated lightly, and separate between those, or pause between those a thin layer of substance under that is consolidated after that cover.
When it seems that consolidation has occurred in one part of the hand, then you should dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and fits the shape of the member.
When there is a swelling (incision) of the limbs, it is called varicose veins.
Varicose veins are a condition where the veins in the limbs are swollen and full of excessive melancholic fluid, which tends to occur more in the legs than in other parts of the body, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers and those who wear tight clothing.
I advise that you administer purgation of the heart of dark-colored blood, some veins being expelled strongly, and the patient is bled from the basilar vein.
The cure of their wounds is second: one is to make an incision and bleed the black sanctuary, and the other hand is to raise the vein and remove it entirely.
The incision of the vein is made according to this hand: first, cauterize the beginning of the vein with a strong burning tool, so that the black sanctuary is resolved, becoming feculent in the vein, and then strengthen the vein from the thigh to the end of the incision in a small or large section, and dry the black blood in three places, and raise it from the end of the incision through the thigh, and then apply it to the wound, when the black blood is sufficient and the number of times you want, and the wound will tolerate the virtue of the thigh.
When you have found that part, and command him to abstain from black, corrupting drunkenness.
And continue the cure with phlebotomy when the veins are filled and it is noted in the thigh.
Then the elevation of the thigh is followed by this method: you who raise the thigh, if it is not mottled with red, and place the hand on it and massage the thigh of the tail that envelops it and the veins are exuberant; or if it is exercised by strong exercise, and the hand is not at your present, then when the member is cold.
And cut the cord on the right side of the vein in sections along its length or at its base, or at the bottom of the vein you must remove it.
And open the cord with scissors and remove the vein from the entire area where it appears in the feeling, and you must see the appearance of that which declines to black.
And when you cut and remove the cord, you see that white is the cord.
When you have placed your hand on the elevated and swollen hip, hold it steady for a moment.
Cut another section of that section for three days, and scrape the skin from the area where the vein appears.
Raise that and insert it into the second section of the thumb, and remove that and raise it within the section that is above the first section, and remove that from the first section.
And place it within the area where you removed the pus from all sections, and insert it completely; and then insert it.
If it does not comply with your orders to extract and raise, then insert a needle made of hard steel and turn it, and remove that and insert the hand and turn your thumb over the entire area where it is swollen. And keep that from being inserted; if it is broken, it will be difficult to raise that hand and it will come over the thigh for that reason.
When that entire area is completely exposed, place your hand over the location of the hairless skin that is submerged in water and olive oil, and care for that entry where it is healthy.
If the vein is obstructed due to tortuosity, which is wrapped around certain parts and not following a straight path as they have been told, then you should cover that area with your hand over the entire tortuosity of the vein and its surrounding areas, and suspend it in that way that raises it.
And remember that you have not pierced the vein and do not pressure it in that way, as it may be difficult for you to raise it; and use your caution in this.
The shape of the incision made in the vein is:
It is not an acute angle like the fingers or a sharp end because it does not press on the vein; and it has great flexibility, which if it were subtle, would pierce the vein with its subtlety; there are too many large sizes as they have been said.
Removal of the thigh vein.
This vein is generated in the thighs of low lands as in the Ategi in Arabic lands and in the low, dry lands of India with little fertility and where there is no grass or bush.
When the pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate other parts of the body, it is called gout by doctors.
The treatment of the pain is caused by putrefaction, which appears as poison coming from the heart and snakes, spiders, and worms, engendering between the flesh and the bone.
The susceptibility of the occurrence of the pain is due to this vein that happens in the inflamed area, and the place is sutured; and another comes out from the location; and another starts the vein there, which seems to be like a plant.
And when the end appears, you cover that you involve over that one a piece of a ball, which is the foot of a dragon. Enter into it, and cut off that and let the ball hang down from the wound.
As many times as you see that by the pain has any cause in the parts of the body, cover that with a ball and cut off that. And if it is prolonged, you cover that with a part of the body and wrap it around; and if not covered that which is outside, then if it is covered and entered into the flesh and adds apothem and poyredure in the place and ulceration bad.
When the affected part is swollen and needs to be extracted little by little, it should be removed from the body cavity and not returned to the body without causing any further harm.
This vein is found in many men who have a certain length of palm and thumb, and I have heard that one of them is about 20 palms long.
If it is inserted at the time of medication, insert the ray into the abdomen through the incision and pierce that long incision into the body, then remove all that is in the material and administer putrefaction to the area for several days with medicines; and cure that part with the care of bandages.
This vein has some ramps, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and goes to that orifice, and is located under certain orifices, and is found in many orifices.
And cure that part as has been said in the division and according to what has been said here.
From the section above, generated veins under the skin are called bovine disease.
This disease is called bovine malady by those who have seen it in cattle, where the hooves are affected and the legs are thin, and it spreads throughout the body and causes pain in all parts of the member until the leg breaks and comes out.
The generation of this is due to putrefaction of some humors that consist of worms, snakes, and insects, and parasites in the belly.
When the patient is afraid of the malice of the doctor, it happens when he enters the body and reaches the head, and then goes to the chest, where he strongly pulls on the patient's breathing and enters and destroys the chest, and then makes uncomfortable movements.
Then when you want to cure that and extract it, you should not know if you have the ambulatory and appearance of the body in sensation, and then cover that which is over him and which is further away from him, and apply it with force on him and on the limbs that are constrained and tight, and then wet it over him and extract that.
And if it is to be pierced in the flesh and not to be removed, then you should pause the cautery on the spot where it stays, and the main cause of fear is corruption of the part which corrupts the place as they have said.
If you see that it has passed to the head of the chest, then apply pressure on the overlying part with strong constriction, and wet it over him, and extract that; and cover that this body uses for the corrosion of the healthy chest by the use of medicines evacuating putrid humors, and keep away from those generating putrefaction.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it
This disease is common in our land, and it causes pain in various parts of the body, and it spreads from one part to another.
When you have already seen that which you are now recommending to me. I was called to attend a woman with a foot problem in a village, and I discovered that her arm had an inflammation of a small vein in the funis, and after an hour, I saw that inflammation disappear as if silver were being poured into this, but I did not notice that it was because of the location of the vein in the location.
And then, the pain subsided in that place and remained in the muscle, and it stayed like this for an hour.
And then, the other arm was corrected to pass through the other knee.
And I recommend to you that you turn your body so that you see the other side; and it is too wonderful to change the position of the limb and the speed of the member to the member. When you have already seen that in the best hands, following that hand, but you have seen how those who are suffering from pain want to change the position of the member to the member. I did not see that in the hands as it was in the woman.
When I first realized that it was not something else but gout, because the woman was young, with a slender body and visible veins, and in this case, the sensation of pain was like a prickling feeling.
It is necessary that this treatment not be apparent in those who are delicate and have humors that are not clotted with veins.
When you want the treatment of the patient and they feel that pain, do not appear to you as if it has been done as they have told you, then strengthen that and afterwards remove it and press on that part inside where it is that feels that prickling sensation, and cauterize the area.
If you do not see the wounds on the thighs, then you treat that as an exception to the heart and its expulsion of prickling sensations, and remove those unpleasant pills and serpent's gall and similar ones.
Extraction of sage.
Sage is diverse according to the species and locations on the body where it is picked, for those that have large points, petite, concave, and narrow ones, and solid ones; and of those that have three angles, and of those with tongues; and of those with stars.
When the symptoms of the serum are noticed in the organ, and the bones pass through it, and the cyphal is over the brain, which is affected by severe headaches, scotomia, vertigo, and loss of consciousness, as well as inflammation and spasm of the tongue, and paralysis and permixtio of understanding, vomiting of choler, and great bleeding of the lips, and the word is cut off and destroyed by the voice, and the location of the moist wound resembles polls, and there is a sign of the appearance of the flesh at the sight of the carn.
If you find these symptoms in your patients, then avoid surgery and extraction of the gallbladder, unless it is necessary.
If the gallbladder is swollen in the abdomen, it is likely that it is located on the left side of the pelvis, and there are no signs of inflammation; and the movement of the gallbladder resembles the movement of the finger, and a dark color of the plasma appears, and coldness in the extremities, and sweating, and spasms; and therefore you know that death is near.
If the gallbladder has caused inflammation of the lung and excessive sputum from the lung, and the vessels that are closest to the colon are affected, and the color of the thigh changes, and the spirit is expelled in great amounts, and there is a strong desire for air cold.
If the gallbladder is in the membrane that is in the chest, and the pain occurs in the small costal bones, and a great amount of violent pain and spasms are felt, and not all the muscles are affected, then...
If you suspect that the cat has swallowed something, it is best to consult a veterinarian immediately, as some ingested objects may cause serious harm to the cat's digestive system.
If you suspect that the cat has swallowed something in its stomach and it is stuck, or if there is any sign of plague, intestinal tissue, or hernia, and there is no hope for the recovery of the cat's extraction, it is best to consult a veterinarian immediately.
If you suspect that the cat has swallowed something in its bladder and it is passing urine with feces, and there are any signs of disease in the parts affected by the feces, and there is severe pain in the thighs, you should immediately consult a veterinarian, as this may be a fatal condition.
The other parts of the body are similar to those of the face, neck, and shoulders, as well as the spine, vertebrae, and joints, and they are saved when the cat does not have a vein or artery blocked and is not bitten by a venomous animal.
And I recommend that you have seen the appearance of these cats, so that you can understand what to do for their treatment.
The cause of this is, for in a man there was a cessation of the flow of tears from the eye in the corner of the nose, and you extracted that out of another part, then the gray of the eyebrow, and it was healed, and did not become infected in the corner of the nose.
And you extracted another cessation from the eye that was stopped in the corner of the eyelid, then the eyelid was left with the eye, and the cessation had already been hidden and not seen from that, but it was a great cessation among the sharp sagetas of the Turks, which had a leon in the which there were no eyebrows.
And the eye was healed, and it did not become infected in the corner of the eyelid.
And you extracted another cessation from the eye that was stopped in the corner of the cheek, and it was an Arabic sageta, and it was that which had the eyebrows; and then you inserted it under the guidegi, and it was already submerged in the cheek; and then you subtilized it over it, and extracted it, and it was healed for the Crestia.
When another wise woman was asked by a man who was lying on his stomach, and thought he would not live much longer; and therefore, after forty days had passed and no change had occurred in his condition, she went over the patient and examined him closely, and he was cured, and the accident did not recur.
I saw a man who had a woman castrate him on his buttocks, and the plague was consolidated over it, and after five years, the wise woman was in the position of the thigh.
I saw a woman who had a man castrated in the abdomen, and the plague was consolidated around it, and it did not change in her condition, and the woman did not become barren in any of her natural functions.
I saw another man who had a woman castrate him on his face, and the plague was consolidated around it, and the wise woman was not pregnant with pain, and she seemed to be in good health.
I extracted the woman from the man of the first king who had been castrated in the middle of his thigh and had already passed away at the end of the day a small one, and the entire woman was hidden.
When you were called to attend to the patient's case, it took three days for the swelling of the leg to subside.
Then you examined the swelling of the leg carefully; then you inquired about that which was hidden, and did not feel it; but later you felt that the tip of the needle was on the ankle joint, and then you wondered if that was at the end of the leg.
Then you examined the place where it was most painful and attractive and digestive, confident that this is the location of the leg, because it appears to me that this is the location of the swelling.
Then you did not find any significant accident in the location that you had caused the swelling; and you continued to examine it over the days without finding an accident, and the swelling gradually subsided, and the leg of the knee joint was relaxed for several days after I felt the swelling with my hand.
Then you stopped using the acute corrosive medicine for several days after it burned, and you touched it with your hand, and I examined that, and I found the tip of the leg subtle, which adhered to the fist.
When you have adjusted the patient's position in the abscess for that acute medicine, after I clearly saw the tip of the finger, and it took me about four months to pass the time.
When you saw the abscess was swollen, and could easily insert the forceps into it, and leave it there, and not allow it to become inflamed, then you did not cease to subtly and ingeniously manipulate that maneuver of the engine over that am manieyras of engens, after which I found the form of those in the neck of the capillary, and then extracted it; and then restored that abscess.
And if the doctors found that the cartilage of the nose was not restored, and you restored it and the abscess was consolidated, and the wound healed for the entire well-being of the patient, and did not return to it in any case.
And I recommend to you the quality of extracting some abscesses because it pauses this rule and has significance about this that I have not said, four parts of this article and the definitions of that are not understood in the narration nor do I understand those free.
The artificer wise compares little about many things; and I think that it is present what is absent; and the novel operation and the novel instrument need the descent of the causes outside the art when it happens.
When you say that knots are not outside the members in which they are tied, either by attraction to the place where it is wound, or by the opposite part, it means:
When that which is entered through the location where it is inserted, or is proceeding from the flesh, and is pulled out and re-inserted.
If you do not obey the time required for the catheter, it is likely that you will lay it for several days until the flesh surrounding the part becomes dry and the attraction of the part and its exit are relieved.
And if it remains in the bone and does not obey your time for insertion, you will have to lay it for several days and wait for the attraction and moisture to occur on each day, and it has been re-inserted.
If you do not obey the time required for the catheter, it is likely that you will have to perforate in the circuit of the suture on that part of the total journey until that location is amplified by the suture, and extract that.
If the gout is already aggravated in the location of the body and is aggravated by the sentiment, then you should investigate that am, and if you feel it, then shoot that am with the sturmentz that are convenient for the treatment of the hernia.
And if you cannot reach it due to the constraint of the plague and its length, and there are no nerves or veins here, then you should apply to the plague when it is amplified and it is possible to extract the gout.
And if it is held in the arteries that are sick, then you should cut the flesh in which it is stuck, and treat over that, if you cannot treat the escape of the flesh in the fracture of the aurelhas and in torssio of those that obey.
When you are performing the removal of the tumor in any location where it is, use your own twist of the forceps at all parts that pass through that which causes the obesity and that it be flat and that it be a true reflection of your difficult attraction to it and to that extraction.
If you cannot do that in that time, then you must stay there for a few days until the parts that are in the circuit of your body have dried out, and then proceed with that which you were unable to do. If you have any objections to this treatment, I will administer the remedy that has been prescribed in the capital for this condition.
And guard your virtue from the obstruction of veins, nerves, or tendons, and administer an ointment as best you can to prevent the sweat; and make it easy, calm, slow, and firm like what has been recommended to you.
And then make the patient sweat according to what is appropriate for the condition of the thigh, so that the sweat comes out in that area, which is less painful. If this is not possible for you, I will administer what is possible according to the figures.
The sweats that are caused by the opposite direction of the other part, or that have been treated in any part of the parts, or cause gilbositat (an unknown term) of the sweat due to the feeling of the part pushed out of the cord, and then you press on that; and that section is according to the quantity in which they grasp with the forceps; and then attract it, so that it becomes less eyssiment (another unknown term).
If the pain is held in the bone, then you should cut the leg with the opposite hand entering the bone, and expand it as much as possible, and then remove it.
Otherwise, keep that for a few days, and repeat it as needed.
If the edge of the hammer is in that position, then press on it with that.
If the edge is broken and needs to be administered with force, then insert it and that, if it is too tight, stretch it by placing your hand on the concavity of the bone and pressing on that edge with force.
If the bone is concave, then press on that edge with force while inserting it, and the bone will be held in place by that.
If the bone is intoxicated, then cover that part of the flesh where the verse is, as much as possible, and treat it with care, as appropriate.
If the bone is in the chest, or in the stomach, or in the vesica, or in the side, and it is near where you touch that part of the verse, and it is possible to do so without harming it, then wash that area and keep an eye on the veins or nerves, and remove it, and place it back if needed, and care for it after it is healed.
The first line of the text is a medical term that refers to the shape or form of forceps used for gripping or holding something. In this context, it is likely referring to
These lines seem to be discussing the shape or form of the forceps, which are designed to hold onto something without causing harm or damaging it. The "extremitatz" likely refers to the ends or tips of the forceps, which are sharp enough to grip but not so sharp as to cause injury. The "cum serra" could be a metaphor for being firm or secure in one's gr
These lines appear to be discussing the different types of grip that can be achieved with forceps, depending on the size and shape of the object being grasped, as well as the strength of the grip. The "motas specias" could refer to specific techniques or methods for holding onto an object, while the "grans" and "paucas" likely refer to the width or thickness of the forceps. The "migieras" could be a reference to the precision or accuracy of the grip.
This line appears to be discussing the process of inserting an instrument into a concave cavity and forcing something through it. A possible translation: "Then, as if the intestine were being inserted into a concave cavity and forced through it.
This line seems to be discussing a type of surgical procedure related to veins. A possible translation: "Of ven
This line appears to be discussing various types of veins that are commonly targeted for surgical procedures, including those located in the neck, face, and mouth. A possible translation: "Of the veins that are commonly targeted for fleubotomy, which include those located in the neck (such as the external carotid artery), the two temporal arteries, and the two lacrimal veins; the vena prepared in the lower part of the front, and the vena that is at the extremity of the nose; the guided veins located in the chin; the veins located in the labial floor; the veins located in the labial roof; and — these are the veins that are commonly referred to as angular veins; and those that are located at the end of the tongue. When the veins that have been severed in the thighs are considered, four of them are called crural veins; one is the "vein of the head", also known as the "wolf vein", and is composed of a ramus from the basilica vein and another ramus from the crural vein. It is called the "vein of the whole body" when it is paused in the domestic basilica vein, known as the "ciliar", and is named "venter" by the vulgars for the "venter" vein, which is paused over the focus, and is the one that undergoes flebotomy and appears above the ankle for manifest appearance; and salvage, which is the vein that passes between the ear and the little finger, and is found in two ramuses.
In the foot and leg, there are three veins; one of those is where the curvature of the wild lark's leg is left; the second is the saphenous vein, its location is where the domestic lark's leg is left; the sciatic vein, its location is where the wild lark's leg is left; and in the camber, there are other veins resembling those.
The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. I will try to guess what the text means and translate it line by line into English:
The quality of smearing those is what you recommend to me: it should be thin at the top of the thigh, and thick at the top of the thigh in the occipital region in the area of the veins that are not too wide or good for friction; then stretch the thigh with your hand inside where the knuckles and joints appear, and place your fingers on the two nodules at the base of the head; and what you said, and if you feel the tips of those with the same pressure, here it is.
Do you hold the scalpel, and that is where it hits, and do you introduce that vein into the socket after it has been cut open to meet the bone. And raise your hand, and hold the vein and the socket at their parts, and insert the vein where you have just incised it. And is the length of the incision the quantity of two adjustments or around that; and do as much as you wish.
Then stretch the powders and place them inside after it is healed.
When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And after
Many of the arteries are venous and serve as the source of energy for the flebotomy procedure, which is an ancient and malicious practice that often leads to excessive bleeding and painful wounds. And after
The quality of flebotomy is second only to what I recommend to you: tighten the thigh until you feel the veins coming out, and then hold them with your hands. And do not let go until you see the desired result.
And if you raise the catheter over the vein at the desired points, and insert the flebotomy needle into the indicated position, and then lift the vein on its own; and inject the solution according to the amount of your requirement.
And after the cauterization of the thigh, and rest on the desired position over the vein for an hour, and then rest on that cloth and pulsate and tighten the part that is under strong constraint, and lay it outside when it is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And so, the initial step in venous thrombosis of the front is similar to the venous thrombosis of the cephalic vein in the ancient diseases of the face, including emigranes and rogors, as well as ulcers.
And the quality of the cephalic vein thrombosis is second only to what you recommend to me; therefore, it strains the desire for one bend that appears within which the vessel is located; and then hold the instrument that is named by the physician as the one with this form of the vein:
Place the point on the prominent part of the fossa over that vein and prick it with your finger or another cause in your hand, and leave the scar running according to the quantity you want; and then desist from the incision and strain that enters when it is healed.
And some thromboses are opened during cephalic vein thrombosis, but it is not clear whether the thrombosis is of acute extremity as with other thromboses, rather it is of the opposite extremity, and the cephalic thrombosis is second to the transverse one, where the os is propelled and fort the threader cuts into the fossa when it subtle.
When the health of the two veins that are the tear ducts of two nipples for scar tissue and seborrheic dermatitis in the nipples, and for the wounds of the face.
And the quality of the incision is that it tightens the collar and makes it look like a needle, and you should stand over the head of the patient.
And if the incision is made according to the transverse and longitudinal plane of a few fleabites, where there is no flesh; and if the incisions are small, then the extremity of the ear is cut off.
And if it is necessary to run the scent as much as you can, and stand over those holes, and tighten them with a needle, and then remove them.
When the incisions of the vein of the nose are similar to acute fever and high-velocity saliva, and for the wounds of the face, eyes, and scabies that occur in the face, and especially when it is old.
And the quality of the incision of the patient is that it tightens the collar and holds the nose with your left hand, and takes the incisions small and places them under the nose in the right location of the head of the nose according to the straight line, where the vein does not appear in the sensation here, and where the scent begins to flow so much.
The first line of the source sentence is: "Cove que tu ultimes la tua ma am le fleubotomi petit a petit e fassas correr del sanc segon la tua necessitat;
May the advantage of the female castration guide you to the constraint of the male and the beginning of leprosy, as well as the maladies of the poor and the uncured and the corrosive ulcerations, just as in epilepsy.
And the quality of the flebotomy of those is that the patient stretches out each leg separately; and the artificer should be over the head of the patient, and the patient should be lying on his side.
And the flebotomy of the vein is that it is cut long, but not too much at a time; and some parts are removed later, according to the need that arises, and it seems like another vein.
And the patient should be made to lie down and tighten the veins as much as possible, without causing the patient to faint, and then enter the mattress where the plague is healed.
The advantage of the flebotomy of the veins is that it removes small blisters and pustules from the mouth, corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and the bad ulcers in the nose and inside the circuit.
And the quality of the flebotomy of those is that it relieves the patient from suffering, tightens the thigh of the patient with a wedge, and turns the lips of the patient and looks at the other veins of which one is on the left side of the lip and the other on the right; and the demonstration of each is by the nail of each toe, and it is less in the circuit of those thin black veins; and then insert each in its place.
If you doubt further, and do not know which of these is the most important, then understand the majority of these, and the clear manifestation of that one.
And give the appearance of veins that are in the lips of those.
More blood vessels are found in the tongue than in the lip of the patient, with the flebotomy of the head at the forehead, in the uvula, and in the mouth.
The quality of flebotomizing those is that it follows the lip between the patient's teeth and raises the tongue, and looks at the tongue from one vein and another vein, and the color of each is darker.
And continue to flebotomize each one; and keep in mind that you do not cut the veins, but leave them behind when flebotomizing those, as they are arteries.
And your veins that are flebotomized in the thigh are in those that are usually found in all men, and the flebotomy of those is made with two hands, or use lemons or olives for subtlety; or use a flebotomy knife, and ask if it is necessary, and this is the form of the tongue:
Is the width of the thigh like that of the veins, and it is necessary to open the concave full veins that appear to be large, and those that contain the thick gout.
And this flesh cutting is of smaller width and with a gentle extremity, and it is necessary for the fleshing of small veins that contain the gentle citron.
May the advantage of the fleshing of the basilica vein, which is one of three veins: take out the gall from the stomach and the intestines, and that which lies in the chest and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the flesher, when fleshing that, to guard and be careful not to harm it, and if he does, there will be an artery, and if he punctures it wrongly in the fleshing point, he may cut that artery and cause a flow of gout, so that he should not flesh that without fleshing pungent, as the anatomy says.
If the basilica does not appear in a manifest way, you should believe that you are seeing it and that you are moving to the other side, or that you are surrounding some ram there; or that you are making incisions in the location of the end of the arm, where that is manifest; and that you cut it as they have said.
If you want the incision of the elbow, you should cut through the stricture of the arm that touches the location inside where the location of the fingers is, and place it over the arm as you think; and then cut the brace and the vein that is cut in a concave way by fleubotomy as they have said; and keep in mind that you should avoid the percussion in the space of the artery's location.
And when you see that the limb is stretched, inflammation occurs in the location that you have seen as you think; and that inflammation is inflammation of the artery, so it twists.
And if you see that the blood flows in the incision as wax from a child's nose, and it is a subtle rog, you should know that it is of the artery's blood; and you should cut and pause the thing said about that for a long space; and then remove the thing said, and if the blood is abscised, several veins are abscised, then stretch the arm and let go of that.
You should guard the patient's leg from the cold, and place it above their heart to prevent it from getting cold for several days until it is healed.
If the wound does not heal, and sometimes you are not present to treat it with medicine, you should incise the artery if you see that; or take a previous stick of fist, and press it on that, and hold it there until it stops bleeding at the location of the vein that is in stricture, and the pulvis for another day.
And if the wound heals, then it is; and if not, you should care for that which was preceded by the remembrance of the location of the powders that flow from the wound.
And the healing of the wound is difficult in the positions that are disposed for the small part of the plague and the possibility of the vein of the arm.
Perhaps the removal of the dark vein is the best way to extract the wound from the subincision of the head and to the end of the chest; therefore, which is composed of the ram of the basilica and the ram of the cephalica, as they have said.
When the anesthetist covers the area over the fear in the anesthesia of the patient, it is a nerve; and then if they adjust to the puncture of the anesthesia and paralyze the nerve, it will cause the patient's stupor, and it is difficult to treat the patient, and for the patient who is not cured completely, this nerve that is seen as a sensation appears; and if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not shown, you cover the anesthesia with your hand at the place where you perform the anesthesia and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then you should find the vein in length.
The advantage of the anesthesia of thecephalic vein is that it relieves the pain of the head and alleviates the maladies of the eyes.
And if you want the anesthetist to puncture in this very place, that is, whether they puncture the cephalic vein or the facial vein; then all the veins are saved, and neither the artery nor the nerves are left outside.
However, it is very important for you to be careful with other patients, as if you do not perform the flebotomy in the first percussion, you will not notice that apostemat in that patient.
The first of them is that you know that flebotomy is not administered unless it is in conservation of health and for the hope of the patient and caution of the possibility of diseases, and that a correct flebotomy in one of the veins that are in the thigh is: cephalica, black, and basilica; and that a correct flebotomy at the beginning of the first day, after dinner, and in the autumn, and in winter when significant signs of repletion appear.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Then return the intestine or hernia to its c
When joint pain is treated, when it is convenient and necessary to do so, or not, at any time of the day or night, in total hours and minutes.
This source sentence translates to: "However, if the womb is not dilated before twelve years of age, and the female does not undergo a procedure until the fourth month within the seventh year, and the walls are not dilated which have already passed sixty years.
This source sentence translates to: "And when it is necessary for any woman to be dilated, it is recommended that the uterine folds be left uncut, if they have been held by a catheter, so that the veins do not excrete superfluous substances in the dilation of the uterus, which are pure and do not affect the main members.
This source sentence translates to: "And if the women are not dilated with the natural discharge of mucus and excretion, nor escaping from malnutrition or ebriety within which they remain after it, nor malady of dyspepsia, and moreover that dilatation is troubled by colic pain and vomiting, and coitus, and exercise of labor or watchfulness or total causa which dissolves the virtue, or is corporeal28 or animal.
And if you consider in subtlety of humors that is causing this pain, whether it is cold, wet, and heavy, or if there are any medications that can be given to relieve this pain as much as possible.
And if you enter into baths, whether any cause does not prohibit it, or if it is exercised by some exercise for that this pain becomes subtle.
And pause the fleebotomy on the chest, as it is time for third-course dinner, as they have said.
And tell me what pain this chest has suffered on that day of all animal accidents, as you have said, how much anguish, rage, fear, and of all corporal accidents, how much labor and superfluous pain and weight and resemblance to them.
And at its close, the causes should be present in the use of the one that people usually use for pain, which is aromatic and odorous and has balsams and resemblances to those that follow in the same degree of possibility.
And follow the fleebotomist on a cushion that is placed either on that which will be fleebotomized or on the one that has been fleebotomized.
When extracting the arm, and sharpen that on its own with three cuts; and then tighten the ligature around that sharp edge.
If the stricture is tightened, whether it is tightened to the extent that it does not close, or if it is too loose, then forbid the flow of blood; or if it is softened, and forbid the body's heat.
When the stricture is tightened, make sure that the one who performs the flebotomy sharpens his tools between them, entering through which veins are inflamed, and they are declared by feeling.
When the flebotomy tool is sharpened on the patient's arm with a small amount of ancient oil; and then place the finger on the opposite side of the vein, at that location where you want to perform the flebotomy, so that the vein leaks a little, and the percussion is set as far away from the vein as possible, so that the vein does not burst when performing the flebotomy, and those that are full of gas and when you stop the flebotomy on that side, you must remove the flebotomy tool; and the flebotomy does not cut the vein, and if it does, that one is tightened.
And so, in order that this flesh-eating knife may be stopped and be troubled in all these causes.
When you have paused the dissection, if the vein is hard in one place and then softens in another, then do so; otherwise, continue to another vein in that location or over the intestine, if the location does not become inflamed.
And if the location becomes inflamed or the thigh is swollen, then you should massage it for a day or two, and do not strain the limb, as much as possible, to avoid relapsing into inflammation, nor should you enter into baths.
And continue the dissection if necessary.
And if the incision is small and bleeds slowly and you fear that it may not reach the desired amount, then continue the dissection in that direction with another cut, and make sure that the incision does not become inflamed, as in case of inflammation in many women, you need less incision.
And if the location becomes inflamed again, do not continue on it, as there is no cause for you to avoid it; and pause over that part of the blade of the needle, where the corset of the wound is, to relieve the pain of the wound. This place is better than oil and the others.
Apparently, oil is used in all types of incisions during which veins are cut, and then typhoid fever or tetanus is caused when one of them is placed over the area, causing the sanc to sublimate and roll up when it becomes large.
If in the location of the incision a large abscess is generated, where watched veins accumulate, and particularly to that which has not been bled except that vein, or in the inflammation of the small vein, and you close it, and place your hand over the area, sponge infused in water and salt, a little scrubbed, and stretched for an hour, where it dissolves.
And if this is the case, then apply properly the dressing to the sanc of that vein, either in the complement of that vein or another vein.
If Roman is in the location for any days any black or green, you don't notice it; and if you want, place your hand over that cause of aloen and dissolvut, or any cause of sweat or wool or like that of Lu.
This sentence appears to be discussing the occurrence of certain movements (motas) that require the intervention of a surgeon (apostemas e eminencias). The term "fleubotomia" is not a standard medical term, but it seems to be related to a procedure involving the bas
This sentence suggests that one should pause their work and place their hand over the affected area, and if there is any pain or discomfort, it is due to the evil influence of the eminence. The text advises to continue working with caution, as there may be issues with the artery.
This sentence suggests that if the area is inflamed, it should be treated with a stiptic agent to make the area endure, and further care should be given to the affected part after it has been made healthy.
This sentence appears to be discussing the relationship between the health of a person and the amount and quality of their sweat, as well as the color of their sweat, which can indicate their health status. The text suggests that the quantity and quality of sweat can vary depending on the individual's level of vigor and the appearance of the sweat.
This sentence suggests that if the sweat is black, one should apply a remedy immediately upon noticing it, and if the sweat is thick, a different remedy should be applied. The text also suggests that if the sweat is watery, one should avoid applying any remedies until the acuity of the sweat has been determined.
When the vein is stretched and the flebotomy is amplified, and the flebotomy is large, it is necessary to extract blood in a vein.
And if the vein is small, then make the opposite point, and extract it in multiple veins, and the track should be straight.
The better way to administer in flebotomy of vein is that it should be the transverse section, not puncture.
This method of flebotomy is saved from the flow of blood and the injury of nerves, and it is praised and saved as a successful flebotomy according to latitude and longitude.
And if it is customary to have spontaneous bleeding after flebotomy, and you cure that denant the flebotomy with a small amount of infusion in a milliliter or a simple oximel scalfat; and extract the blood from the vein in three or four veins.
And if there is excessive bleeding, then you should take infusion from the flebotomy with a milliliter or a simple oximel scalfat in an ear drop of mirrors or an ear drop of aromatized honey as it has pebre, canela, ginger and similar scents, or an aromatized and odorant one.
If hernias occur, and it causes the patient's discomfort, then you should perform fleebotomy, and take an amount of warm animal water, along with some fragrant odoriferous substance; and use aromaticity from one of them, and place it near the patient's chest.
And use other causes that have been mentioned in the division of the capital of hernias for evacuation.
And if the patient's arm swells and dissolves the hernia secondarily observed, use that of which the fleebotomy is for evacuation, and its virtue frees, which removes the hernia little by little, so it is according to the amount of the virtue in the following days.
More often the patient's arm swells and dissolves the hernia secondarily observed, and the patient's chest becomes strong, then you should perform the operation in about seven hours or nine days after the first fleebotomy.
More often the hernia of the chest is pulled towards the opposite side of the part where it was previously attached, and it should be done on the second or third day.
When the body is in which the wound is already sawn and sharp, and causes fever, because it is the wound of the sick person in one cut and is largely cut and amplified, the perception within what happens without sinus is pushed; and you will have preserved all the conditions of flebotomy; and you must place your hand over the knees of the patient's body, because it does not die in place of sinus, four slices are made when the flebotomizer is ignorant and negligent.
When you want to slide the arm and evacuate the second puncture, as the wound of the vein is already closed and the pain is quite difficult for the patient, you should press with great force and bend your hand slightly, as it is too painful.
If the cut is second-degree; or if you are afraid of the sharpness of the cut that coagulates in the vein; or if you pause over that with tyranny, or with sadness, and compresses a little the wound that is outside and out.
And if the vein is gangrenous, you must open it and do not touch inside that gangrene, which is sedative.
And if you need to make you evacuate the second puncture immediately and not excuse yourself, you should mark that over that place or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "thigh funnel" is cut in place of the black or the basilica, when it is not inflamed or swollen, and it is composed of those.
The quality of the incision in the foot is that it introduces its hand into the watery tail enters that the vein appears clearly.
When you place your hand on the affected area with the tightened ligament, and then make a small incision parallel to the transverse petal, neither horizontally nor along the length.
Is the incision wide and is your fleubotomy the one you made on the joint of the other leg?
And if the flow of the salve is prohibited, then you iterate the leg in the water puddle and let the salve run in the water until you achieve your necessity.
If you were in the summer days, then you would excuse the iteration of the leg in the water puddle and the heart of the salve in water for a while during the rain.
And the fleubotomy of this vein is placed saved that of all the other veins, four out of five do not have a pulse, nor nerves.
And the fleubotomy of the gallbladder duct is compared to the diseases of the liver.
And the quality of the fleubotomy of the other leg is that you tighten the ligament or the other, placed because you have it in the water puddle, when the vein is inflamed and is demonstrated at the same time; and the incision is parallel; and if not cut in all no will be able to reach it in re.
When preserving the joints and not finally closing them, it is customary to leave the foot bare, as the doctor will see the bones of the disrobed toes.
Then, immerse the foot in cold water and let it run over the wound, as if you do not immerse the foot in cold water, the blood will coagulate at the vein's end, and it is forbidden to bleed.
When extracting the blood according to the amount of need, you should place your hand over the vein or sea, so as not to solidify it completely; and it seems that you will do this in all cases straight.
The advantage of the joint examination of that of the other thigh is that it is consistent with the diseases of the table.
And seemingly in the joint examination of this foot as you have done in the other.
The advantage of the vein section in the joint examination is that it is consistent with the diseases of the part opposite the foot, such as the diseases of the other parts, and with retention of menstruation, and ulcers of the thighs and old changes, and with their appearance.
The quality of the fleubotomy of the patient is that it enters the limb through the leg and covers the area where there are veins; it also makes points on the joint of the foot; and the location of the vein is apparent at the tip, and from there it follows the path that branches into the face of the foot.
When it comes to making a cut into the abdomen or wherever the addition of the needle is needed, it is better and you need to add some salt.
If you are making a cut on the sole of the foot, pay attention to the nerves that are still present there, and pause your incision at the point where you want to insert it, as if you were inserting it.
And let the cuts be well.
If the injection of the salve is prohibited, then you should irrigate the foot in the running water and let the salve run through that which has been evacuated.
If the cutting tool goes wrong in the first attempt, you should irrigate the wound with a little water, at the place where the salt is; and do not fear the malicious one, rather that you protect yourself from the nerves as they have said.
And it seems to be a sign of another foot's engulfment.
And the location of the sciatic vein is as they have said, you need to leave the tail of the hand in the wild part of the cavity.
When the operation of the knee is for pain in the ankle, it is done by cauterization.
The quality of the knee operation is that it enters into the bag, and quickly and firmly tightens the thigh muscle of the wide part within four to five fingers of a long, thin needle, which does not appear except for this reason.
And when it appears, you should operate on the second leg that is closest to you and the opposite side, and it is better; or if it is incised, it is cut, and the location of the knee is left open.
And in most men it is not affected; and if you cut it, and it does not appear at the moment, you should operate on one of the thighs, and that which appears in the two feet is the one that is heard and worn out.
And keep an eye on the nerves, and run the cauterization as much as you want.
And then loosen the stricture and hold over the location of the knee cut, where the wound heals.
This line seems to be discussing the causes of pain or discomfort, possibly referring to certain weather conditions (ventozacio) and the nature of the affliction (qualitatz
This line suggests that joint pain can be caused by various factors such as corns, warts, or other irritations.
This line indicates that joint pain can be exacerbated by certain activities or conditions, such as scraping or excising warts, and also by exposure to cold weather.
This line suggests that the pain caused by scraping or excising warts can be alleviated by applying warm or cold compresses to the affected area.
This line provides a detailed list of locations on the body where joint pain can be alleviated by scraping or excising warts, including the armpits, groin, chin, jaw, mandible, lips, ears, nose, cheeks, neck, shoulders, and various other parts of the body.
This line suggests that joint pain is not caused by the removal of sinew or tendons, but rather by the removal of small blood vessels in the flesh, and that this can cause further discomfort similar to that caused by a botch. It also notes that joint pain is not necessarily alleviated by applying warm or cold compresses to the affected area if the entire body has been evacuated of waste.
If labor pains are caused by a difficult childbirth or continue for a long time, it is necessary to administer medicine at the beginning of every month and throughout the entire pregnancy, and in the woman's private parts and at any other time it may be needed.
And when any of those causes are present, and especially if it is in the middle or end of the month, then you should command that midwifery be performed as soon as possible, no later than two or three hours after the day.
When the windpipe of the neck is affected by gravity, it falls into the head and pushes down on the shoulders; this can be due to an improper evacuation of the entire body.
This windpipe is in the location of craniotomy for the head.
It is not necessary to use that which is of complex nature or in the quality of catarrh, as it can cause great harm.
Therefore, it is not necessary to use those vile parts, and in the heads of those who are poorly shaped.
What is more, if one continues to stay over it, they will lose all memory; and therefore, it is necessary that you command the windbag to pause its suction slightly on the parts left, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Less windpipe of alchemical wind is in the location of craniotomy for the dark vein and the basilica: and therefore, it causes asthma, and constraint of the air and the scissure of the storm of the air, and tos, and replecio.
When the wind is colder than usual, a small amount of it can cause weakness in the heart and stomach if left unattended.
The wind of the cold air can cause accidental pain in the head and throat, eyes, and face, as well as toothache, and it is in the location of scalp incision of the brow ridge.
When you command the windcaller to not press on their own hand, but instead to scrape, so that the artery does not get hurt and does not cause blood to flow.
The wind of the cold air can cause alcohol to be left in the mouth, and corruption of the gum, and appearance like that of diseases that are in the mouth, and it is in the location of scalp incision of the upper lip.
May the wind that is made on the upper lip with spatula causes calidity to be absorbed by the cafathan, which is made for replenishment of heat.
And the wind of the upper lip that divides the fingers of the fire causes vitality to the scalp incision of three veins, which is of the brow ridge, black and cephalic, where that atracts the artery of all those veins pushed by the flesh, and those veins that are pushed by other veins that are fat.
When ordering the surgeon not to perform too much incision, let the location be stripped of flesh, and then remove the nerves and arteries.
A wind is one that is used to ventilate the cavities of the thighs and to apply ointments to the ulcers.
And command that the wind be large and that it be of earth, and that it demands a deep cut; and then use subtle winds and perform incision by incision.
Many winds are used for massaging the joints, and they relieve all pains of the body, including those of the knee and the groin, as well as the vagina; they also provoke menstruation and relieve bothersomeness and aches; and they are used for fleshotomy on women's pelvis, abdomen, and cavities.
Finally, it is said that the entire body is relaxed and that sutures are made in the testicles of men.
And the pleasure of the wind is directed to the pleasure of the winds on women's thighs.
The quality of the position of the bellows is that it pauses the wind as soon as it begins to see and passes through with enough time, and does not prolong the position of the bellows, less pause those slightly, and return them gently, and that the humors come to the place by chance encounter. When you do not cease to use this and continue to enter when you see the area already swollen and inflamed and the sign of the gallstone,
When you shave and clean the skin little by little, and consider in the position of the body,
When that person who has a hard skin on their rare parts, covers you with a cloth and does not put any oil on it, so that the place is not ulcerated.
When commanding the wind to enlarge the incision and make it wider, and immediately apply the necessary ointment.
If in the sinus it becomes large, you should know that you make incisions with sharp knives, and in the first cut you should enter the subtle route of the sinus and the cavity of the body. Then in the second, with the examined water, you should examine the removal of the large sinus.
And if the sinus is very foul, you should make a deep incision in the last cut to be able to remove the dirt.
Finally, when you want to extract the sinus little by little or in parts, one incision is enough for us.
And if you want to extract more sinuses, make the incision with a larger incision; and if we know that the sinus is large, you should make the incision with a wider incision.
The end of the incision is the depth of the cut, which is only considered.
And if that of which the cut is thick, hard, dark, and the parts are straight, you should know that the holes of the winds are more open, more resolvable; if it is in summer, use olive oil or olive oil of garlic, or olive oil of comfrey, or olive oil of chamomile; and if it is in winter, use olive oil, olive oil of liquorice, olive oil of camomile, or olive oil of sinus, and those like them.
If the superfluity is large, then cut it off, and if you want to make it look better, use olive oil, or oil of balsam, or oil of aloe, or ointment of anise, and let it be seen.
If the ventilator is of large size and has flesh, then cover it with something that is not oil, and cover the areas of the ventilator with these locusts or with water from the sea, or with water from the bath, or with water from the laundry, and let it be seen.
And the one that has the moisture of the sand, wash your ventilators with water or with sea water and vinegar, or with any other liquid that is suitable for them.
And of the one that has the superfluity of large size, wash your ventilators with water or with vinegar and sage, which is majorana, or with decoction of anise, or with camomile, and let it be seen.
And cover the ventilator with cloth; having covered it with something that is moistened with water, and let it sleep with the ventilator.
This is a complex medical term that can be translated as: "What should be done to allow the winding of the veins before the ventilation?
When you consider the beginning: if the wind or that which gives off a sharp odor is colicky and causes inflammation, then you should know that it is caused by cold things, such as acetate of milk, and by wetting oneself in the morning and evening, and by sesame, and julep, and to the effect on them.
And pause their walks as much as possible, and meat of sour animals, and condensed foods that are fatty, and to the effect on them.
And of that which causes the complexion to become dry, know that it is caused by drinking too much beer and eating, and walking between morning and evening, and using little beer and food, and stopping the walks of the legs, cannabis, piss, small animals, and columbine.
And know that in the day of wind and cold, beer is greater than food.
And know that in some hours at Tyrus or Tyre's wine, or muscle medicine, it is muscle, or alcohol taken before wind or cold, or after, for that the principal members are comforted and the soreness is alleviated; and do not know that they take that scald.
When the wounds that were made are winding wounds that have been paused on their flesh, and over the malleolus and gout, and the umbilicus in the locations of the joints, and the groin, these members do not suffer from winding wounds on them.
It is not sought for those only but attracted to the member, as winding wounds are paused on the breast in the flow of the sac of the sac of the nipple; and they use it as that which is dissolved by ventositat freja invviscade of the member, as they pause over the abdomen and the umbilicus; thus that rare member soothes and scorches the pain that resolves ventositat.
And if it has been paused over the thighs when they have fallen into laziness or burning, then by virtue of strong attraction to attract laziness and remove the burning from that place.
And it seems when it has been paused over the flesh and the malleolus of winding wounds in those enclosed.
This winding is managed with great success, and some of them are managed with fire.
Some of these windings are managed with full water in the abscesses of the thigh.
And it is because the winding is full and large that water is added alone or water in which herbs have been added to make it suitable for this purpose.
Form of winding managed with fire: the width of the orifice is twice that which we have formed; and the quantity of the preon is the greatest of a palm; and it is in the middle of the winding, in the location where it is in the circuit, the greatest of it, the thickness is small according to the quantity that enters it a needle.
The cause of the pain may be due to rogue or lemon, large margins, leon, engulfed and scattered so that it does not lead the member to its position over it.
And if the cause of the pain is on the side of the vein transverse of rogue or iron, where candle is placed over the fire.
When this wind is too great for that which has been recommended; and the few more of that second part of the diseases and the state of him who uses that of that.
The winds of the elderly are more harmful than those of the young and large-chested.
The quality of stopping this wind is to focus on the member that extends the focus of the willow leaf gently with a few drops of wax, and place it over the midsection of the thigh in the midsection of the wind, so that the focus is ignited around the end where it will not burn the chest of the patient.
And if it is placed over the thigh of the patient, and it is said that it is over the track that has been said, then when you have the winds and do not indicate that they contain the track and that the vapor is on that track, then the wind will dissolve so much.
And then uses the focus according to his own hand, and repeats it if necessary.
The greater the wind that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, thirst, in which there is no transverse or track, and it is not administered except with water, and it is focused on the member only.
This is the form of this: This breeze, the more it grows, the better, because it can receive a great amount of water.
The text you provided is not in the language you described, but rather in Latin.
The text you provided is also in Latin and translates to: "Blood clots have not been managed in any members except those in which there is no possibility of positioning a vent, due to their smallness, like the gums and teeth; or in a naked member, like the nose and ears, where they resemble.
When it comes to the quality of using those that if you have found bloody discharges in the clothes of well-made shoes,
When the patient's limbs are stiff and they do not move, and no cause is found in the abdomen of those; and the chest is emptied at the beginning of the anesthesia and after the ventozas; and the thigh is relaxed after it has twisted; and they are placed on top of it.
And when they are full and ready.
And if the place can be opened by the wind, it is less painful in recovery.
However, wash the place with cold water and agua de vieira; and it will be cleaned and expelled.
And if the course of the sinus is prolonged by the pain of the blood vessels, and there are still residues, then place a damp cloth on it with water, and place it over it until the residue is absorbed.
And if the sinus multiplies, you can powder vitriol or similar substances on it, or place them over the location until the sinus has abscessed; or they are placed over the location with the feet of the vines attached to the location, and the sinus is abscessed.
When necessary, perform a bloodletting operation, if it is possible to change those.
If bloodletting is prohibited by suspension, then make incisions in the location where it can be safely done or insert a needle into the loci that are most affected; and let those be closed, so that when any sore appears, it does not become infected.
And when you want to clean them, sprinkle a little of aloe or salt, or ashes, and wipe it off.
Now begins the treatment of the third part: restoration. This chapter is necessary for the art of medicine; and it is a restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
Oh, son, wise that you are, do not cast down this chapter the faults of the physicians and the vulgar and those who for time do not pay attention to the freedoms of the Ancients nor read from those one letter.
And for this reason, this science of the scientists in our land is private; and you are not obliged to do it at that time; and I have not been able to do it, except by long reading of the freedoms of the Ancients and study on their understanding, within which I extract the science of those.
And accordingly direct oneself to experiment and study along the length of one's life.
I have already described everything in this chapter that pertains to my knowledge and the science I have passed; I put it before you now and relinquish it from further occupation; and I open it at the end of the description; and I show it at the end of the declaration; and I form it in various forms of the drugs that I administer in that, as is done by addition of the declaration, so have I done in two previous chapters.
Chapter First.
Summary and collection of the fragments of bones, from those whose preliminary release is necessary before we begin to remember the fractures and different ones of each. Therefore, let us say in the prologue of this chapter the summary of the sermon; and the chapters for the understanding of those who at the beginning were the artisans and stood on the truth of these; so you and they who are prompt to know or learn this noble art from others.
And say that when an accident happens to any fracture or dislocation or torsion or twisting, you should immediately go to the beginning of the amputation or lay hold of that, or if you cannot, then by any means which is most bearable to virtue, or it is that which happened, or is very old, or is time of great heat, or of great cold.
When the patient is well-nourished with herbs and lean meats and fish, and prohibits fatty meats and excessive intake of food that fills the veins with blood, entering if you are sure of not getting appendicitis, and if you do not fear an excess of matter in the member.
And return the patient to the first regular course that is usual for him.
And when the patient begins to be restored, you should ensure that this diet is not nourished by non-nutritive foods of fat and heavy ones in which the viscosity is found, as those that are made from flour with water, and meat, and bones, and cheese, and milk of cows, and fruits, and vegetables, and greens, and grapes, and similar ones, and this diet is made for coagulation of fractures and wounds.
You know that bones become soft when they are in men and in the first childbirth and in the elderly, it is not possible that they continue and are solidated later in their nature by the drying of the members of them.
However, nature adjusts and covers the cut ends of all parts caused by any reason, seeming like glue that grows thicker as it adheres and becomes stronger within that which is conglutinated and linked, within that which causes the strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, within that which does not prohibit that from being one of its works.
And for this reason it is necessary to stop the thighs of the patient, thighs in which gravity and viscosity and heaviness are found, as has been said.
And you know that the types of fractures are different according to the part of the body, and a fracture of the pelvic bone is different from a fracture of the skull; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the other bones, it seems that all other parts are also different from each other.
When I remember all the cases of fracture, I find that they are distinct from one another.
There is a great diversity of fractures in their nature. There are different types of fractures in the bones; some are curved or angled, while others occur at the ends of the bones; and some are caused by the length of the bone: and so are the fractures of the ribs and pelvis and other parts, which can be caused by force or not, as when they are prepared to be written, and are a crack or disruption in the head, and a fissure small.
And for all cases, it is essential to remember the specifics of each fracture in order to restore them according to what was remembered in its distinct location.
There is a lack of knowledge about bone fractures. And for this reason, bone fractures are known: it is the tortuosity of the bone, and of that prominence that appears to the touch, and so of that when I understand it with my own hands.
When there is no apparent twist in the location and it does not cause pain when touched with the thumb and the thigh does not cause great pain, then there is no need to fracture the bone.
There may be twist or a small fissure, but it is not necessary to worry about that with your hand; there may be compression of the whole; there may be pause over the part of those medicines from which you remember at that moment what is appropriate for the place; and there may be stricture subtle.
You know that this location when it is curved and not divided into two or another so that no accidents occur in its saturation, as the whole part of its comparison, if you are careful, then you should consider what happens in your time for the correction of those that happen to you.
And if you have an aposteme caut, then keep that for several days until the aposteme ceases; and remove that second hand that you can lift and draw.
You know that the restoration of that and the cauterization is done with a different bone than the one that occurred in the saturation.
And then tightly tie that second one which will be the reminder of you.
If in the os of the sagged bones, it is necessary to extend this member cut off by several parts, whether it is the foot or the heel; or if the member is small; or if several cords or one cord and the ma are needed.
And if your position is at the place where you pause the member in its natural location, while the parts that are extended from the cut-off member are being tightened, you will find that you have to return those additions to their original places and according to each hand that can be placed in their locations.
And keep in mind that you should not have your force fall on the patient's thighs due to your operation or injury; and if you find yourself in a situation where you need to apply force to one bone with another, do so according to better forms.
And at that time, use your force advantageously on your hand there, and if sometimes another cause appears, adjust it and cut it according to the amount of your virtue.
When there is excessive extension and compression, it is necessary to follow the example of doctors who perform surgery by making points on the surface of the body with a pointed cautery or by causing contraction in the member they have seen during the operation of their own movements.
The quality of the stricture of the member is that which you recommend; because you know that some members are different in their shape and size and form.
When those who are small in stature, such as the arms and hands, and resemble those, cover that which is the envelope with a fine silk cloth.
For those who are large in size, such as the thighs and buttocks, cover that which is the envelope with a tough and hard cloth, where the lip connect the member large and strengthens it throughout its entire part, and there is no space between them.
Then, begin to empty your bag of equacio, place the appropriate cushion over it, on the location of that fracture am three or four times the size of the member; and hold it with a small hand the lip.
Then, place it on the part that is the edge of the location of the fracture, and hold it tightly so that it does not strain the member you have strengthened in the location of the fracture. Then, elongate the member's envelope at the location of the fracture a little, and gradually soften the stricture, so that when you take hold of the part with a large part, it does not break.
And take another knife and wrap the other vein around the location where you want to enclose it, and see if the enclosures are at the end of the fracture; and your operation will be in the stricture of the enclosure and in the mollification of that second one that they have said in the first enclosure.
And pause between the feathers of a lion or a fox that has an engulfed tortuosity of the fracture, if in it there is a tortuosity; and otherwise, do not pause in it for any reason.
And pause over the other knife, and engulf over these enclosures that are slowly formed as much as possible, if in the location there is no inflammation or post-cautery, and you pause over it that sets the post-cautery that holds the inflammation; and lay it aside for a while; and you hold over it the enclosures.
And were the enclosures of the cane of the horse's tail, and they are formed in a proper way; or are of bass wood; or of ramps of the palm; and is the width of each enclosure according to this form and this figure:
This sentence appears to be describing the proper placement and use of a splint or cast over a broken bone. Here's a line-by-line translation:
When the sons are large and thick, and many in number, and if they are large, as you have seen in the operation of another doctor making points on the fils of cords of the tort, and it is an error, when the stricture is not equal to the fils.
If the sons are too thin, it is not suitable for you to be sure of the stricture, and there should not be any difference between one and another.
If the wound is closed by the ends of the stitches at the location of the stricture, you should pause there for a while, whether it is made of leon or lana carmenada, as it does not cause injury.
Some visible fractures are considered as plague, and there is an accident of disruption in the code, and you will find in the capital second singularity.
And you know that all the cut members are not straight at first; the cause is that the member, when it is large, does not stop over the stelhas for a short time or seven or more days, according to your security of the occurrence of gangrene caut.
This is the manual of plasters used by the ancients, which were placed over fractures and dislocations, as well as twists.
When making a splint for a broken bone, it is convenient to use a complex and majorly on the thighs and buttocks, where no heat or friction is found: and that is because you take powder of millet, and the miller's bone that you need to move the mill in its sockets.
And comfort that as it is, but do not use that thin or subtle album, and pause the comfort of it; and instead use that one.
Another splint for broken or dislocated fractures and torsion: recipe of assafetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of unguent, and migra, which is made from salted millet grains, of all dracs. x; of honey and aloe of dracs. v; aloen of dracs. xx; all the parts and joints and crackles and mixtures that are in water with alcohol or album of huou if the complex of the thigh is scalped; and use this splint, which is of good composition and restores the fractured bones gently, and confirms the homes.
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
This sentence is quite complex and seems to be discussing a type of medical treatment or procedure. Here's a line-by-line translation:
When treating joint pain and bone separation from their former locations, and dealing with accidental pain in those areas and fissures and fractures: hold a clean bandage and dip it in vinegar and oil, and place it over the area.
However, this ointment does not have restorative properties, but rather helps to remove and expel pain.
Another ointment that restores the incision: take fresh leaves of fig tree and saffron leaves; mix them all together and make an ointment.
Ointment for the restoration of bone fracture and when you want to resolve the aftermath of trauma: recipe includes aloe vera, camomile, violet flowers, flour of ers, all parts in equal amounts; they are all grinded and mixed with oil, if the member does not scar.
However, if it is scarred, comfort the member with that water of humidified colander or with that water and use it on the patient.
Another ointment for quick resolution, when severe trauma occurs and the member is damaged: recipe includes aloe vera and semen of li, and balsam, majorana, violet flowers, camomile, all parts in equal amounts; they are all grinded and mixed with water of sauze or dousa or water of vi, depending on the quality of the member and the color of the skin.
When Yocantha does not find in the free market that there is a need to place something on the member trenchant, it is necessary for the restoration of the sinew, and it is recommended that there be more between bigness and subtlety.
May Gualia has been seen that there are points on the member trenchant for the restoration of the sinew and the causes in which there is drying due to lack of heat, which is similar to that recommended by others.
Ointment that soothes wounds and pain: recipe mixed, of oils, of hairs of the skin or pennyroyal, and aloe, and salt, divided into portions; they are mixed and wrapped and closed, and it is made into an ointment.
May the quantity be according to what covers the wound and is well separated, because you consider if there is no pain or discomfort or the sinew is not broken, it is not bad of its place, you do not open too soon. And if there is pain or discomfort or inflammation at the site of the wound, you should close it or remove that in the hour, and take away the ointment from the wound.
When the member is wet and a sponge is placed on it, and it is submerged in warm water, and that part is washed with soap to cleanse the area where the prickling sensation and pain have subsided; and allow the member to rest for an hour; and then cover the wet hair with a cloth dipped in vinegar or rose oil, and place it on the member again after an hour to ensure there is no cataract formation, and to reduce inflammation of the member, and to alleviate the pain of the member.
And repeat that constriction gently and lightly and stretch it without causing pain, and gently apply it inside to ensure its safety first.
If at any time there is cataract, weakness, pain, inflammation, and all other accidents have become less severe, and you are advised to apply plaster and constriction, then repeat that constriction as you began with the gum engagement.
If no harm comes to the member from those causes that have been mentioned, then do not remove it for less than three days or four or seven; and some wounds are completely healed within twenty days after your departure, as they have said, within the time the fracture adheres, and when it is settled in the coagulation of the flesh over that.
And you adjust in the stricture of more than in your first stricture's, and auster in the congestion of the food of the thigh, secondly after the rememoration of it.
If you see the place of the fracture has dried out and lessened than it should, you know that this food is prohibited to reach there; and therefore, gently squeeze that water from the whole wound that delivers that; and keep it for three days; and then open the stricture a little, and for this operation, give nutrition to the member, and it will heal.
If the restorative clays of the fracture of another wound do not restore it to its original state when it is not restored at the beginning, then after it covers, and it is restored according to the tortuosity, it is an error in the operation of those, and there is great fear, and if it is right, it will enlarge the Antics in free liberty and aggravate or obstruct.
And I have not seen any of them do that, for it is reasonable that it does not happen.
When a fracture occurs in the head, it is called a skull fracture.
The species of fractures are dislocations, and their figures are various, and their causes are distinct. Four types of fractures one is caused by percussion of the skull, and the percussion affects all the bones that enter the cranium, which leaves the bones behind as if they were in the cheek, and for this reason this species is called a conchoidal fracture; or the skull pierces a part of the bone, and pierces the flesh and does not pass through the piercing to the back of the bone; and this species of fracture is called avulsion.
And the plague of these kinds of fractures is great or small, and of those that are contrived or artificial; and the cause of it is percussion or caustication over the bone, and its appearance.
And this fracture is penetrant that has already approached the pancreas which leaves the bones; or it is in the face of the bone, and the plague of these kinds of fractures is great or small.
When a bone breaks, it is healed in the bones, in the subtlety of the small hair petite, and therefore this type of capillary fracture is called this.
This fracture is caused by impact or percussion of the nail and appears to enter any layer of the bone into the parts of the fingers, and it is made in the concave location as happens to the bones when they are hit by the hammer and part of them enters the parts of the fingers.
And this is indeed made in the bones of the human body, as if it were the heads of the nails.
And all these types of fractures are small and like threads separated. And you will find that this is completely in its place.
And you would recognize all these types of fractures by detection over those and by the examination of their attempts and the flesh that is rotten that is over them.
And the capillary type is recognized by that which is discovered over the bone, and it is removed, and it remains on the attempt, where the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fracture, it is considered at the beginning the accidents of the thigh, and you should consider those that signify by their meaning for the manifestation of pain over the part, such as vomiting of color, and extension, and loss of understanding, and abscess of vote, and sincopi, and acute fever, and edema of the toes and rigidity of the same, and resemblance to those in greater positions, and its dose is not cured.
If you sometimes encounter non-corresponding accidents, hope for health, and begin the treatment of the patient.
The cause that comes to you in the beginning is the same as it is infected and it is in the days of winter, and you should know that you study on the outer part of the bone from which the day of the twelfth total position has passed.
And if it is in the days of summer, you should know that you have covered the bone from which the seventh day has passed, having that as though the bone is corrupted by the panniculus, and that accidents will occur that have been changed.
If the fracture has already penetrated the calvarium, covering it with the skull, and the fragments are broken and split, then you should consider that the part is infected and torn, according to what I recommend to you.
It is said that you have infected the thigh with the plague, and over the bones, follow the second custom and apply your hand according to the figure of the plague, and it should be on the affected part.
If you find the bone, use the detection of the bone, flushes of sin or aphasia cautery, and then apply your hand to the area as before, and it should be sated with the aphasia cure when it is sedated, and you will be sure of the flow of the sin; and then start at the circumference of the bone and in the ablation of the bone.
And this is one of two hands for operation.
The one hand is that you insert the bones into the thigh with an osteotomy saw, and this is the form of it: And then administer another osteotomy saw, a few push that one; and this is the form of it:
And then administer more osteotomy saws that were pushed earlier.
And cover that you need several names of osteotomy saws, of which some push more easily than others; and some are short and those are in the end of sharpness of their ends, and they are of iron or steel.
When using the above-mentioned remedies, it is important to note that they should be applied with caution and only by experienced practitioners. The language used in this text is a form of medieval Latin, which was widely used in medical texts during that time period. It is important to understand the context and
If the bones are hard and strong, you should cover them with a layer of skin or flesh before inserting the scalpel into the circuit of the denuded part that you will administer the inscissors to, which are called non-penetrating taravels.
I do not name any other part but the testicle itself, unless it is called the head of the testicle, which is the end or margin of the taravel, which resembles a margin or a small circle, which prohibits being submerged and passing through the density of the bone.
It is convenient that you take a large number of these taravels, which are suitable for the spicitude of each bone, until you reach the extremity of the one that is sharp at your present position in all parts of the brain, the quantity in length and breadth is second to the quantity of spicitude of this test.
This is the form of three kinds of teravels: The quality of piercing into the circuit of the cut bone is that you place the teravel on the bone and revolve it around that as you know if the bone has been penetrated; and then move the teravel to another location, and pause there until it has passed through the entire extent of the size of the ring or goes around it.
Then insert the blade into each part of the bone, and make it subtle so that you can over it without lifting it, as they have said, when you have divided the bone, or if your hand is there, or if another cause for such distortions occurs which would have appeared at that point, as tweezers and fine forceps.
And be sure that you guard the blade with all caution that it does not touch any cause of the cipher.
And when the bone has been perforated and is separated from the cipher if it continues on you, and you extract it, be sure that it is not caught in the sharpness of the other parts of the bone as if it were an inscissor, but rather be sure that it is subtle and not caught in the other blades.
If you encounter any small, sharp bones and joints, then grasp them with that ease which is due to you as a surgeon; and thereby cure the pain and find out which ones have caused it.
The other hand of the operation is longer, taking more time, which is praised by Guy de Champagne and his followers; and this is the saying of it: It is necessary for you at the beginning to discover the part of the bone in which the fracture was made with great force and manifestation, until when you have discovered that part and have paused at the end of this slow but pleasant cut of this type:
E is that the lenticular part is like a lion and does not penetrate any cause, and the sharp part is on two lateral sides in length; which means that the lenticular part should be adjusted to the cipher am the face of the sharp bone at the incident agua in the os.
E if you cut through the incision of a part with a small malhet when all the bones are cut, and you are sure that the panicoil will not happen in this accident that you fear in any hand, and if the physician 14 were the fool of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he were asleep.
If the pain is caused by any reason and attaches to the bone of the ankle in certain places of the bone, it will be located at the extremity of the ankle bone that lenticular, and will be facilitated at the place where the pain is located, which is facilitated by the bones of the foot.
If the fracture does not penetrate into the bone, and that which is separated or remains on the bone is the face of the foot, and there are roughnesses and subtle spots on it, it is likely that those roughnesses and subtle spots are caused by the razor blades that you have prepared for different quantities so that you can possibly administer those in all places with appropriate pus for them and the pus of the second part where you lose your operation that broken bone and the figure of the foot.
And cover that you administer in your reason with the one that raises the bone at the beginning with the purulent pus of those razor blades, and use as much as possible of the subtle pus of the foot, and do not stop giving until you have given all the purulent pus of all those.
When there is any small fracture of the hair or subtle fracture, follow the treatment that you have used to correct the position of the bone.
When it comes to the cause, it is not expected that all those who have studied in that art will be able to master it. And as they have shown us in great fractures.
And if the panoply is tightened when you reduce the bone, you will find that you hold one handful of cloth for each unit of plague, and submerge that in warm olive oil, and place it over the orifice of the plague; and take another doubled or tripled handful of cloth and submerge that in warm olive oil and place it over the first handful and press aloe on that to alleviate the pain you can apply to that, not straining it beyond what the plague can bear only; and administer aloe to that part, and do not squeeze it beyond the quantity of plague you have.
And keep that on for one day or two after you are sure of the cure; and remove it and administer medicines as needed for thirst, such as linen and flour, and powder of enses and alchemy, and like substances for those.
It is that you make of these powders that they be powdered over the skin, as they are dry; and generally, they are administered in this entire medicine of whose property it is that it purges and does not irritate.
You should follow your virtue that is causing the plague in your curacy; and do not be in its negligence of engagement nor another; nor should you add virulence to it; for when it is adjusted over the pannicule of the brain, corrupt that and prick that, and ascend upon the malady with that malicious wickedness.
And ascend upon the skull of the head, when it is made monstrous by the bone and more so when the care of it is removed, and darkens in its surface; and then consider that if you ascend to the malady the accidents that have been told are true.
And if you do not darken but from the medicine that is placed below, and it is virtue of that medicine that causes that darkness, then know that you hold in your hand one part and three parts of olive oil, and apply those lines to the skull, and place that over the crypt; and care for that with the specifics of cure that are suitable according to what is healthy.
Chapter 3.
When doing a nose job (restoration) it is customary to use cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body,
It is not the nose that is cut but rather the bones that are divided into parts and then removed, or one of those some cartilages, for if you have two bones, the part where the nose is located is cartilaginous, and it is not cut and does not fracture, neither at the nose nor in its surrounding areas.
If one of the parts of the bone is cut, you should know that you insert the small piece into the nose, and that you mend the fracture at the top of the small piece, and at the point where it was broken, and then return the nose to its natural shape. And this is for your convenience, and keep in mind that you should not close the wound for your operation on the patient's thigh.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the bone division and the small piece does not fit well at the end of the bone, then you should know that it is necessary to make it fit well at the end of the bone.
If the fracture is in several parts, you should make it look like that.
When restoring the thigh on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then use about the sixth or seventh part of the cautery for the closure of the incision.
And insert the end of a draping bandage into the tip of the nose, if the fracture is in one piece, or if it is in several pieces, and if it is in the largest piece, so that it fills the cavity of the nose.
And tell the ancient restorers that the splints should be wrapped in albumen or powdered chalk, and that the meca should be wrapped in a cloth; and lay it aside when the bone is fixed and the cartilage is endurable.
And some wounds may be in the nose, instead of splints, because leon's drapery is too thick; and it is that you have fractured the nose before and that the thigh is not restricted from inspiration.
This cause is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, make splints.
If another swelling occurs after the cauterization, apply the following plaster: mix the honey or the wax in a mortar and pour it into a thin layer on the affected part, or use a poultice.
If you do not have swelling after cauterization, you should know that you can apply a poultice made of flour and ermine powder on the affected area; and place a piece of cloth over it, and do not let the honey cause any harm.
If you fracture or break the bones of the nose, you should know that you can cut over those parts, and extract the pieces using instruments suitable for those parts; and close the wound, and cure it with what is appropriate for the nose, which hardens and consolidates, and applies plasters suitable for that.
If you have a swelling in the nose, you should know that you can cure it by compressing it and administering intravenous solutions of plasma as needed to achieve complete recovery.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not painful, observe if the fracture is deformed only, and not split in two and curved to the sides, then its recognition is easier.
Then, if the fracture is in the left side, introduce the right indicator in the mouth of the patient; and similarly, if the fracture is in the left mandible, introduce the other indicator from the left mandible; and thus, to facilitate the deformity of the dental fracture, use the same bone of the other side of the defect.
And if the mandible fracture is already separated into halves, observe that you administer extensions of parts on either side according to right angles, as long as it is possible to align them.
And if the jaw dislocation occurs with teeth, strengthen those that you think are bent to the gold or silver wire or yield; and pause over the split mandible, and over the drape doubled, and over the great knot of the lower jaw, or a single tooth of the length of the mandible, according to what you have arranged the groove of the teeth and that it is convenient for its application, as long as it is not destroyed.
When ordering the patient to use rest and tranquility, and to stop eating the foods that cause lethargy.
If you suspect that the figure has changed in any way, you should cut and remove it on the third day; and then correct what has changed and apply powder made from sand, alum, or flour, which you had left on the wound, and place a layer of lion's fur over it.
And after applying and adjusting the plaster over it, and ensuring that the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, as it will not come out until it is healed and strengthens the fracture; this fracture is strengthened in three weeks with four watched days.
If another accidental stroke of lightning occurs, you should administer the medicine that has been given in four watched days when the patient is healed, and keep that stroke of lightning from happening again.
If the fracture is infected, you should consider if it is due to the separated or split bone, and you should carefully observe which of those sutures is appropriate for that in the removal of those from the limbs.
If the wound of the plague is straight, then you should enlarge it according to the quantity of your need.
When you have finished cutting those stitches, and if they are not too tight, then use the scissors of the plague if it is large; otherwise, place your hand over one of the fastenings that is suitable for this and covers that, in order to enter if it is healed.
Capitol v. means "Chapter V." It is a section
Of the shoulder restoration when it is dislocated.
If the shoulder is twisted, the clavicle is broken at the point where the muscle is located, and this fracture is made in one of three ways.
If it is broken, it is separated, or it is separated into two parts that do not have sutures, and it is less difficult for the restoration of the shoulder; or it is possible that the fracture occurred in the shoulder, and it is difficult to restore the shoulder; or it is possible that the fracture is ample.
And the operation on that is when the fracture is ample, it is that you should have two assistants, so that one holds the assistant and follows the dislocated shoulder, and the other extends the collarbone to that part.
When the fracture is in the form of a line that goes through the center of the bone and is not prominent or hollow, it is called a transverse fracture by doctors.
If you need to extend the area, place a cloth or thread under the thigh, and make it as large as necessary; then extend and lift the collar and cut the cloth along the fracture line that goes through the center of the bone.
If you cannot pull the end of the collar to the desired position, then make sure that the thigh is relaxed over the pelvis, and place your hand on the muscle of the leg, pressing it with a cushion of greater size.
The physician presses the muscle of the leg on the parts that are still exposed, and makes sure that the bone of the collar is elevated as much as possible, and then corrects the fracture and places it according to the lines indicated by the doctor.
If you feel pain in the collar and muscles, place your hand on that area and remove any knots for ease.
If it is held in the bone, you should make an incision in the flesh of that one of the cuts that you have seen before, because you had paused further down the shoulder where the collarbone serves as the sternum; and this is the form of this:
It seems like the form of this is that of a butcher's knife; and its length is according to what you need for it, according to the size of the bone or its thickness.
The length of it should be according to what you can possibly make it for the operation; that there be ends as far apart as possible, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the plague that you have incised when you extracted the marrow from the bone is wide, and it is sure to cause an abscess, then you should adjust the lips of the plague according to the suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear abscess, then you should fill the plague with cloths and powders according to the amount of the cut in the plague.
If you encounter anaphylaxis cauterization, inform the patient that it involves cutting through the skin and applying oil, and then stop there.
And so, do not be concerned if the stone does not cover the fractured bone; and for this reason, you should check the wound every day, if when the limb is softened or the stone has become damaged, you must then correct this and tighten the suture.
And then pause the patient's sleep on his neck, and pause further down his titillis so that he can sleep on his side in the bed with a small pillow; because that is elevated the assistant of his arm from the shoulder of that, and thus the fracture of the shoulder is elevated to the muscle; or if his arm is lying on his collarbone.
And do not loosen the ligament if it does not happen in the correct place or hernia, enter within twelve days.
And if you have seen the face of the patient and it is swollen, adjust in the stricture and restore that and leave within what is restored and is coagulated the fracture of the shoulder.
And it is strengthened and comforted every month for 28 days, and some are made in the time of that man.
Chapter VI.
Of the restoration of shoulder fracture.
A sharp-edged spatula is cut at the location of the shoulder and not cut except for the margins.
When you cut the leg of the patient — and it is cut in the middle of the leg — and it is not known otherwise than by touch, then do as follows: first, determine the figure of the fractured bone, then prepare for the reduction of that bone by cutting a second incision, and reduce it back to its natural shape in the entire direction of the bone that is possible.
Then pause over the powder of honey of albumen and lemon, and pause a pulverizer of duplicate cloth; and then pause over the stela lada of the subtle table according to the quantity of the spatula totally or less than a few.
If the stela is now convex in the holes of the spatula's point, then do as follows: cut that convexity with lemon, and perhaps the stela will be equal afterwards.
And then stretch as much as possible the wet long part of the constraint without being tightened by the stela inside that it is not strained of the local location.
And consider the limb in every day; and all watched that is softened, another watched and stretch the leg and equalize the stela if it is strained of the local location.
When the patient lies down, place a pillow under their head.
The spoon is restored in XX days or in XXXV.
Then, when that number is completed, you dissolve the ligament, and you know surely that this is of the bones from which the beginning was not confused nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed to the location of the knee joint and clean the area, then you should cut it off, and take it out, and follow what has been said in the fracture of the sadacio of apostema cauda if it occurs here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the chest.
The chest some ribs are broken in their place and then they bend; but the ends of them remain that are not cut off and are still whole.
And of the accidents when the rib is cut, it goes down to the parts of the dint and causes great pain, difficulty in what is done, coughing, and much fever and vomiting; and it is declared in that cavity of the bone that is cut and not hidden from the feeling.
And the restoration of the patient is that the thigh is placed on the patient's back, and a pillow is placed between the thighs on a cushion; and he should press the muscles of the thigh, adjust the costals of the thigh to the maximum of two costals, and gently guide you in the operation of the patient and the equilibrium throughout the entire hand that can be used and that is convenient for this, until the figure of the bone is returned to its original position.
And he should pause over the plaster and stop and pause the expansion of the table under the softness of sauce or caligo and of what seems to be levitating, so that you can wrap it in a cloth; and he should gently guide you over the cut bone that is not marred; and go through the incision on the back, and tighten the stricture decent; and consider the incision at all times, and when it is softened, tighten that.
And if it is necessary to provoke exfoliation of that thickened or pruritic, painful, or apoplexy that has occurred in the place, you should gently cut and deslip that and remove the plaster and correct what occurs by hand of cure of the patient; and reduce the plaster, if sometimes the face; and adjust the stricture when it is healthy.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided text is not in a language
The translation of "De restauracio de las costas quan son trincadas" is: "Of the restoration of the ribs when they
The translation of "Sapias que fractura de las costas no catz sino en locs grosses que siegon le dos; e de las extremitatz de lor de la partida denant no accideys ad aquelas contricio sino per aquo quar so cartillaginosas" is: "You should know that ribcage fractures do not usually occur in large areas of the chest, but rather at the ends of the ribs; and if they do not break at the ends of the ribs, they will not collapse into the cavities but rather into those cartilaginous The translation of "E cognicio de lu no es amaguada al sentiment deves la inquisicio de lu am les ditz" is: "And I know that the pain is not affected by the questioning of the doctor, but rather by the words
The translation of "E la restauracio sia ayssi que enguales la fractura am les ditz segon la manieyra possibla, entro que sia engulhat segon que cove, e aprop emplastre e strenh le os trencat am stela, si indigeys de aquel" is: "And the restoration should be done as soon as possible, following the most likely method, and if it is not possible to engulf it, then plaster and reinforce the broken bone at the end, if that is what is indicated.
If the rib fracture is leaning towards the intercostal spaces, you should go to the buttocks with intense pain and puncture, as if puncturing that which has bled, and for this reason, place the gauze; and you should experience difficulty in coughing, and throat, and vomiting of bile; and this is difficult to cure.
When the ancients were already inventing such things.
When they said that they were making cuts in the thighs to cause inflammation and swelling, so that the belly is flattened and extended, and the fracture is pushed to the unfavorable parts.
We would not have known this for so long if it were not for the cause of generating cautery, unless it happened; and if it has already happened, you can help with that.
They would advise those who have placed the windpipe and have enough strength; and it seems to reason, but it is feared that the wind will direct the superfluities to the place due to weakness.
They would advise those who have placed the windpipe and have enough strength: that this place is covered with lint that has been submerged in oil cautery, and there are powders between the ribs when it is filled, which is the wound engulfed when it envelops the second retraction; and that this curing of the thighs is a cure for the wind and medicine.
If the patient's leg is severely constricted and does not allow for pain relief, and the doctor punctures the membrane with a point, they should be careful around the leg, covering the area over which they will operate, discovering the torn costa, and placing the instrument that preserves the cipherac, the rememoration of which is preceded, and which inscribes the bones easily, and extracts the one.
And if you adjust the lips of the wound, if it is large, apply ointment, and care for that after it is healed.
If you accidentally cut yourself with a needle, place your hand on the affected area and cover it with powdered rose oil, and the leg will be treated as if it were the wound caused by the needle.
If he is hypoglycemic about the latch that sleeps, after it is cured.
Capitol. This is not a medical term and does not need
Restoration of spinal fracture of the two and the collarbone.
Some cracks have been observed in the bones of the neck, and they are attracted to their traction, and seemingly to the spines of the back. When gout occurs in the foot and you want to know if it will heal or not, consider that if the joints are already softened, numb, and dead, and cannot be touched, extended, or stretched, and when pressure is applied to them with a needle or a point, there is no pain, then you know that it is not curable, and in the end, it is fatal.
And if there is pain when pressure is applied to those joints with the needle or point, you know that the shoulder of the bone is saved and that the disease is not curable.
And if you see the spines of the neck and want to know if it will heal or not, consider the feet of the patient.
If you see that it is already softened, occur in the parts where it occurs in the most, and when you press on the shoulder, you feel ventilation and digestion of the will, and some veins are rolled over the shoulder and cannot urinate, you know that it is fatal, and therefore do not expect recovery in the treatment of the patient.
When no harm occurs to any of those, the cause is better and provides relief.
The treatment of the pain is that you perforate at the acupuncture point where you place your hand over the spine, or if it is red and swollen, or if there are any other signs; then place your hand over that area for a while until the acupuncture point is sedated.
Then place one of the comforting and enduring ointments on that area, and stretch it; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not sleep on the part where the pain will subside when it is healed.
If harm occurs to the tibia or any other cause that is separated from it, you must cover the wound with the blanket and keep the bone; and then adjust the lips of the plague, if it is large, and take care of that am alcu encarnatiu of the enguentz, when it is healed.
If the bone of the thigh is split and the end of the toe is broken, you must cover the wound with the other hand in the anus, and tie the cut bone to the other one as possible for equilibrium; and place your hand over the ointment and bandage, if they are given for those, and stretch that.
If you feel sharp pains in that area, then press on it and leave it alone, and cure the inflammation as the doctor prescribed after the patient is cured.
Capitol. This is a Latin word that means "capital
De restauracio de la ancha. This phrase means "of the wide restoration." However
The bones of the wide thighs are so broken, and if they break, the fracture of those is not a simple communication at their extremities and are inscribed along the longitudinal axis and decline towards the dentition; and they cause pain in the hip and the puncture, and the cushion becomes stunned when the fracture occurs.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it when it is over the fracture, and the figure of it is as follows:
If the fracture is at the end of it, then you should cut that second part according to what is appropriate for your hand, and it will be adapted to its natural figure.
If the fracture is in the long or if it declines towards the dentition, then you should put the hip on your belly over which you have prepared the restoration of that fracture. When you have swallowed that, place your hand over the plaster, and place your thumb over that plate of lead or nail, and press firmly on the one you do not fear a puncture of fracture or removal of the needle.
When the doctor enguails the concavity with their hand that presses on the entrance where the stricture is located, and commands the patient to lie on their side or turn away from it, it means that the doctor is about to perform a procedure to relieve the pain.
If an eclipse of the humor occurs, stop extending the part and its restoration as soon as it is sedent in the humor, and pause over it that settles that following one which precedes; and then return to the restoration of the part and strengthen that ayssi as it was before.
If something happens to the bones or are broken, then you must treat them.
This appears to be a date written in the format of Day.Month
Of the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
The arm is that which is between the thighs and enters into the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then you must restore the arm in one of two ways, of which one is the one that you hold with your thumb planted like this:
They are connected at two ends by threads, and then they are hung from the raised place.
And follow the path over a seal; and then let go of the arm that is broken, which will come into the socket of the bone to which it is annexed by its curve.
And then suspend it over that heavy cause, or the master extends it to the parts left; and then the caulk and the fracture are in the same direction, if the fracture returns according to its course.
And the other hand is that the path is bent over the head of the neck and suspends the hand of the collar of the arm, and commands two masters who one holds that the fracture is in its place, and the other holds the end of the arm; and then they extend from their part.
If you want the extension to be tight, then you should press firmly on the fracture of the limb and on the other limb, and thus the two ministers will extend to their respective parts.
If the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then you should place a cushion under the curve of the limb and the other side of the fracture needs to be held by the hand.
If the fracture is at the ankle, then you should place the limb over that location and on that foot.
Tighten that as much as possible and work on it, and then apply it according to the size you cover and if it does not cause a fistula, do not tighten it further.
If an abscess occurs, then loosen the tie on the seventh day and pause over the wet skin that becomes red within a few days of pausing the abscess, and then tighten it again.
The maneuver to tighten that is paused with plaster over the fracture, and then wrap it around the plaster; and adjust the arm over the helper, and hold the hand over the joint of the muscle.
And pause the wrap and tighten the arm over the helper's arm so that the arm is in place of the splint, if not for any cause of the broken bone.
When using needles.
For you place the needle over the fracture at that point where there is a pus and it is stronger than the other needles; and place between each of the needles the latitude of the joint, and its longitude according to the trapezoid plus three times the total part.
And hold tightly on the needles at the stricture that I have said at the beginning of the chapter.
For you stricture over the location of the fracture is tightly stretched. For you along the fracture is a smaller stricture.
And if sometimes the situation of the needles and the stricture is as they have said in the hour in which you restore the member to its usual position, then you do it.
And if you fear an abscess, then you remove the stricture and the needles in the day that they have said.
And you consider the limb in all parts for three days so that it does not happen in the place prudently or inflamed; or it is forbidden the food to reach the member because of the superfluity of stricture; and then adjust everything according to what they have said.
If you are over fifty years old and have not experienced any cause of gout, do not delay the application of this remedy for more than three days or more.
And let his bed be over the patient's back, and the pillows be on his stomach.
And place your hand over the full pillow of wool, and consider in all hours of the day or night whether the figure of the cut member is not deliberate nor dissolved, or if the limb is mollified, then correct this entirely according to your virtue.
And let the patient fast according to the order that has been given to him, and make sure that the fasting is gentle from the beginning until it is tightened; and let you cover the food of the patient.
Four common remedies of the pillow and bed are that they should be strengthened for forty days; and you should cover that they are not delayed and are administered in baths and medicines that correct those.
And if the fracture is an open wound, you should not delay applying the remedy to that limb and the splints for several days or for two months.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you provided is not in a

E fort leu es trencat le focil major solamente, o le petit, e fort leu son trincatz ensemp." means "And the larger collarbone is often cut only, or the small one, and both are often broken into pieces.
E quan es trencat le focil petit desus, lahoras la restauracio de lu es leugiera, e la sanacio de lu es pus leugiera." means "And when the smaller collarbone is cut, the restoration of it requires careful work, and the care of it requires careful work.
E quan es trencut le focil de lu dejo la fractura de lu es mal, e la sanacio de lu es dificil." means "And when the larger collarbone is cut, the restoration of it is often bad, and the care of it is difficult.
When the bones of that part are broken, it is called a fracture.
If the small bone that is broken is the little toe, it is convenient for the surgeon to intervene, and you must restore the position of the toe, which can be easily done by gently pulling it back.
If the large bone is broken, you must pull it out as far as possible.
If both bones are broken, you must pull them out as hard as possible.
And if you pull the figure of the woman out, you must restore the position of the leg and extend it over a cushion, and place the fingers of the hand in the parts that are mentioned above, and then all other words should be placed below them, and the body should be placed on a cushion that is tilted at an angle.
And if the cushion is placed under the foot or ankle of the leg, so that the body does not collapse.
And if the doctor extends the arm of the part that is pulled out towards the shoulder or elbow, and another doctor extends it in a similar manner.
When the physician examines the joint and finds that it is swollen, they should choose the best figure that can be.
If in the measurement of the bone there are any deficiencies, then you should drill holes completely in that place according to your virtue.
If in that separate part of the bone there is a broken codon and you do not see your hope for its restoration, then you should cut off that part and take another one as described by those who have told you.
If the fracture is in the hip, and I have already made this capital single case, then take the care of that one.
If you encounter a fissure at the beginning of your restoration, then line up one cloth as follows: a red olive and white wax, and it should be between precision and subtlety, and press the cloth over that subtle fissure when the fissure is ready to be closed; then remove the cloth and pause the prepared powder of clay, and place the stela as follows: the stela that was paused on the fractured part with a little force.
You know that the number of stars in the arm you saw was in the major positions, or if it is a fracture in one bone or in two bones.
And then stop the traction on the site of the fracture with great and violent force, and when less than the extirction of the parts from the fracture or the parts at its bases, stop the traction as soon as possible after the rememoration of the patient at the beginning of the crown.
And the plasters that envelop the fracture are very humid, not hard or rough, and the one that fits best is the one that is most suitable for the specifically subtle and coarse, as has been recommended.
Consider the member and the limb at the appropriate time. And if you happen to encounter any cause for which rectification is necessary, please act as soon as possible with that member, and cover the member with wet cloth until that disturbance ceases.
And the member should not be tightened when it rests, and then return the traction.
If the extriction has already been softened and the bone has been re-growing and appears similar to those, then you should correct everything with your own virtue.
Consider whether the nutrient can reach the member due to superfluity of stricture, for which they cover that softens it a little and makes it less tight over several days as it runs into that nutrient, and apply that.
If there is no cause for those that have been said to happen at the thighs, they do not cover that it has been slid within twenty days or outside of them.
And if the thigh is suspended by its own virtue of movement, and make that sleep on the side of the belly.
Do you know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or sixty-two days, or rather in fifty-eight days, and then it follows the arrangement of the complexes and the arrangements of virtue?
Capitulum XIII.
Of the restoration of fracture of the thumb of the thigh and of the fingers.
Do you know that the thumb of the thigh and the fingers are fractured, and they do not happen to them but by violent movements seen.
When one experiences a fracture or dislocation of the leg, it is necessary to cover the thigh with a cloth and secure it with a bandage, then pause the leg at that point and extend it as much as possible.
Then the master extends the shattered bones and places the foot on them, pressing down until they are in good contact.
Then cover the area with plaster and stop, unless one experiences pain afterward; then pause at that point according to the size of the wound, and you have already wrapped it in cloth.
If the sprain is in the thumbs of the fingers, and cover it with cloth, making it seem like a support for the hand, commanding the foot to tighten around that as if it were a spring; then make it long enough to cover the thumb.
And if the cloth is long enough to cover the thumb, as if the hand were applied to the finger; then tighten it around that point.
If the fracture is at the ends of the fingers, cover it with cloth and place another piece of cloth under the end of the finger, so that the hand is straight and tense; then pause the tightening, as if it were rolled around the ring between the fingers.
If a fracture occurs in any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is the little finger, cut it off immediately and cover it with a cloth, and apply pressure to the palm with your hand, and place a piece of cloth on top to prevent further injury and keep it clean.
If the fracture is in any other finger, cut it off in the same way as in that one, or in the index, or in the earlobe, or in the anus; or all of them are cut at once, which is better; or place your hand on that small piece of cloth, as they have said in the pus.
And consider, in your restoration, and above all, the disposition of the stitching and opposing — as in the second operation — I say that it covers when any cause occurs, according to the narrative of the case.
Chapter 14.
Of restoring a bone fracture of the thigh.
The bones of the thigh that are cut open are divided and declared to the patient according to what is converted into the part where the pus is located.
The restoration of the patient's condition is done in such a way that one bandage is placed over the fracture and another bandage further down the fracture, and the abdomen is laid prostrate on the side belly and face.
And the surgeon extends the bandage to its full length according to the quality of the bone in the location of the fracture.
If it is necessary to tighten the bandage at the knee, then place the bandage tightly at the top of the thigh, so that the extension catches in the femur, and the other bandage further down the fracture.
And if the taping is tight at the knee, then place the bandage tightly at the top of the thigh, and have the extension at the parts further down.
And the surgeon aligns the bones as much as possible within the joints, reducing the second natural and the bone is united by good union; you cover that places plaster and stricture, if not causes to the member apothesis. If you injure the apothesis, then you must remove it within a few days after the apothesis has started to separate, and return to your care.
When the stricture of the patient's joint is: cover that covers over the fracture with a hard needle, bend it into two or three loops, and remain in the superfluity; and cover that enters the talo and the tip of the thigh.
Insert a long thread between the thigh and the joint of the denol, and let the ends of the thread come out at the opposite sides, and wrap them around the joint and the thigh as much as possible that is superfluous from the needle.
And place your hand over the thigh in the location of that astelhas fracture, and place one stone on the bones of the joint.
And fill the spaces between the joint and the thigh with cloths, so that the stricture is coagulated.
And begin the stricture as hard as possible over the location of the fracture with three or four envelops, and when you have fewer liaments from the location of the fracture, your stricture will be smaller and hold more and less.
And extend the ends of the umbilical cord to the parts where it passes through the foot's cavity, and firmly hold the ends of the other strings of the belly per se that the umbilicoid not be torn from its place.
And apply the strain over that, so that it does not happen to the corroding or post-mortem member, nor to the cauda nor to the inflammation, and if it happens to any cause of those, then cut me a piece of that, and correct what happens totally, according to what has been said by the watchers.
If in the bone there is pain from the bone that is placed, then cover that second with what is possible for you; otherwise, fence it around and remove that, and cure that which precedes the remembrance within which it is cured.
And if some watchers firmly hold this fracture of the thigh or another that is adjusted to the other strings, then as has been said in the helper and in the arm.
However, in the restoration of that, it does not happen to the thigh claudication; and if it is restored alone, or another one that is applied to the other string, then you need to walk that of which you have been tempted to walk.
You should know that the thigh is stretched in fourteen days or a few months or a few months, and this depends entirely on the variety of the complexions and other dispositions.
Capitulum XV.
When it comes to the restoration of the fracture of the collarbone,
You know that a collarbone fracture can occur due to violent impact or fall.
If the fracture occurs, it is not just a crack or split in the bones, and that causes pain or discomfort, and everything is affected by that feeling.
And the restoration of the fracture is such that it seems to be held together as if it were broken, but it is actually fixed and reinforced according to what can be achieved with equality and ease and convenience and production.
And then apply plaster and press on that round piece; and tighten the string as necessary for that.
And consider all the dispositions that have been recommended for other fractures, and see how to apply pressure and appearance to those who have opposed this accident to this one that is convenient within what is healthy.
Chapter XVI.
On the restoration of the fracture of the shinbone.
You know that in the thigh there are two bones of which one is large, and it is named after the thigh; and the other is fine, and it is called the shinbone.
And you know that in the case of fractures of the bones that occur in the two bones of the arm, and for this reason a restoration is made of the shoulder as a restoration of the arm engagement, and the operation of the arm is one.
And if these three bones are pressed together, the thigh becomes converted into all parts.
And if the fine bone is pressed together, the thigh is converted into the parts of Denant.
And if the large bone is pressed together, it causes damage to that part, and those causes are not known to you.
And then maintain extension, equality, and ligamentous support according to that engagement.
However, if the fracture of the thigh is due to lack of muscle strength, then extension should be tighter and less league, and it will help your virtue.
In the chamber, there is one cause for operating on the arm, and when you uncover the stitches and see that the entire operation is completed, you take pliers of iron that are placed in front of the causes that are placed in front of them, and those that are made of brass; also of those that have a small amount of dressing, and not of the hands, and it is the length of those that follow the length of the chamber, and the end of the denier inside the pus.
And it is wrapped around each drape in several layers according to the length of the body, and one is placed over the edge of the chamber of one part and the other part of the other part, and they are of the denier inside the pus at the bottom of the foot.
And you have the dresses stitched in three locations of the dress extremities and at the middle location, where this structure of the chamber is prohibited from the clinar to the part of the right and left, and it is for good practice.
And an administration of iron wire according to the length of the chamber has already been made; and it is placed in the chamber by the movement of that.
When you are primarily doing this in a break, and when that really hurts you.
And consider in each day the camba and study that one for further studies, and you guard against apostema and inflammation or other similar causes; and when any cause of those happens, then stop what you are doing and come back to this as soon as it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
Of the fracture of the ankle and of the bones of the foot and toes.
The ankle does not break all at once; fewer bones of the foot break some visible ones; and the toes of the foot rarely break, and only twist in their position.
And if the bones of the foot break and sometimes those bones are raised above each other between them, then return the thigh to rest on the ground prepared as before.
And place the other foot on that which is raised from those bones, and call those, and pull them, and untie them when you turn them in their places.
And then apply a plaster and bandage, and then on the stomach of the foot a small tableau with two plates pressed.
And then apply force to that part of the foot according to its structure, because you have wrapped it in drapes and other causes that indicate it.
And when three days or four have passed, remove the limb, then you will find the bones dislocated, or they are twisted, and the operation is performed on those with chisels and hammers.
If you say that the bones are twisted, then restore them and set them back in place as you advised me in the restoration of those that you mentioned to you. And then stop the twisted bone at the second point of the length of that, and put a little nail on it; and then on the foot this table, which I advised you to use, and apply force to that part according to its structure.
If you say that the bones are twisted in two or three or more, then you stop on each part of its amount wrapped in drapes, and apply force to the table on the base of the foot, and hold it over one of the plates of the table for the belly of the foot so that it holds well.
It is convenient for you to not forget that you do not consider all the causes that I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that have been told to you; and pause for all accident that I cover with this.
1. Quan dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When the woman's conception is three months old, then make that cut in that side, and bend it towards the part of the two, and hold it behind.
And if the midwife does not cut the cord, and it is done in the woman's belly as she hopes; and if the woman is cut, and raises the head of the child a little at a time, until all that is outside the part of the belly where the cord was cut and the os trincat returns.
And if you pause the powder on the back of the child, and when you want to urinate, the cord is made easier and the urine, and reduce it and return that second powder through the same hole that was first, and return to the first powder.
And fast for seven days or until it is restored.
And if you want, take once a bottle of olive oil and strengthen on the umbilic of the child a canula of cane; and enter the whole vesicle into the belly of the child, and infuse through the canula as much as the vesicle is inflated due to the belly, until the fracture returns.
If the wound is fully closed and remains so for several days after being treated, then it is considered healed.
When the joints of the knee or ankle are swollen, administer treatment and medication in the water that has been recommended for the joint of the leg.
And the water that is useful is not hidden in these immediate fractures and does not return often, mainly because of the study and use of this free word; fourth, that fracture means to you in the major positions of the drafter in restoration and stricture, and then understand be.
When the wound of the man is closed, take guarguamela from anywhere, put it in that; and place your hand over the envelope of the dress, and wrap it, and leave it for three days or until the end, and it will be healed.
Chapter XIX.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when they are infected.
It is convenient for that which has been injured by the fracture, and especially if the bones are large as those of the thigh or shoulder, or seem to be like that, that you cut and suture that much so as to meet the conditions of suture for you or testify how many have said.
If the plague flows through the incision, you should cover that you are standing at the retention of the wound that you powdered on the side of the leg that you pierced with the needle, if there is no other cause.
When beginning to mend the fracture on that day, and do not extend it, if you do not want to have an infection.
If an abscess occurs, you must stop the restoration of the fracture within three days, and do not return to the patient on the fourth day or later, because you will cause further harm.
If the bone is protruding above the knee joint, you must cover that with your hand and reduce it, cutting through the soft tissue with ease and minimal extension.
If extension is not ready and the force of the blow is on the knee, you must reduce that with your hand and this tool; and this tool is made of iron, its length is seven or eight digits, and its latitude is according to the quantity of the swelling; and for this the doctor who takes those three or four according to the amount you indicate in the treatment in total species of fracture is necessary.
And it should be reduced, and there should be little resistance from you so that you do not double the compression on that at the time of the operation.
When the pain is at its acute extremity and is marked in the outer parts; and it is the cause of the patient's great discomfort, and the entire body enters into distress.
And this is the form of him:
And it is called "labre volentz atelarem" in Greek, which is a small palette.
Because the end of his pain comes up high on the end of the prominent bone.
And he presses it in a vein that returns the bone, and is engulfed by some adjustment.
And he tries to engulf the ends of the fracture between them, and if the end of his pain is subtle, and does not press on the sturment for good exception, you know that you have inserted the end of that bone inside that instrument has power to do this.
If you cannot reduce the bones of all that have been recommended, then insert them into that bone that comes from the incisions that have been made; or sharpen that bone with one of the razors in whatever way is possible for you.
And accordingly, look at that which is Roman in the bones and hardened muscles.
And when the bones are reduced, and the pain in the thighs becomes extremely violent, you will know that the bones do not return to their natural position; and then do what you can to help the thighs.
When you have completed your restoration of the bone, and you immerse your hand in cold sterile water, and indeed if it is summer, and do not pause over the plague or any other cause, for which there is no need to add poisoning and corruption.
And administer steels at the time of the highest complement of the bone restoration, and leave the plague discovered that has been identified as having indented the truss am forfexs and used according to the quantity of the plague.
And take all caution not to strain the plague on the fracture, that no motas are seen, and do not add poisoning or corruption to the thighs, which are mort or malautia, for it is unsanitary. If the second stricture were softer, it would be different from the softness of the other fractures.
If the plague is large or bad, and you are afraid of those accidents that have changed them, and cause pain in the area, then you should not press on that part, less it causes more pain in the area where there are hard sheets in place of stones and tightens the cloth.
When the plague begins to appear, if it is found in the cloth that was placed on that part, then you should remove the cloth that had been pressed over it and apply ointments, as we usually do for plagues, which are found in tetrafarmacon and resemble that.
It is convenient for you to remove the limb and consider the plague every day at night and in the evening when it is consolidated and closed, and make sure that the member is prepared in such a way that the incision runs from there to the parts away in ease.
If in the plague several days pass and it is not consolidated nor closed by the cloth, then you should know that here are small points of which you must inquire about the plague to prevent them. When those sacks are those that remain closed and extract, those that of them do not remain closed and press the member and cause pain, insert me in the second one that you can possibly insert.
If you find in the plague of swelling or inflammation, it is similar to other forms of corruption and putrefaction, then you should know that there is a point where it is best to place your hand according to what is suitable for the cure of the one who preceded this narration in the upper part of the book.
And from that in the quality that covers what I say and you make present your hand: when it becomes large, lean over the member as the eye and the helper do, and seem like those of the large members, and do not presume to attract or remove from it, nor the removal of it due to the occurrence of purulent matter for about twenty days or thirty; and you cure the plague if you see, and if not, lay down that.
Chapter 20.
When treating a swelling that occurs in the path of any fracture.
This swelling occurs in the course of treatment for a fracture, and particularly when it affects the joints, and is worsened by the figure of the member; and moreover, it strongly prohibits the member from performing its natural operation.
It is then considered whether the swelling is recent and is being treated with those medicines that have anesthetized aloe, essential oils, and honey, and acne, and semblantz; in which case you should take some of those or all, and apply them to the wounds as they are stiptic, or albumen of honey, or agre, and then place those over the swelling, and bind them firmly with good constraint.
And the extraction should be made without delay if it does not yield in those days; and if it still does not yield after that, then continue to extract until the swelling is reduced; or strengthen over the layer of plum that has the property of remaining intact in the limbs.
When the stone has already passed through the urethra and is causing difficulty in urinating, and it is necessary to pass it, you should scrape the area with a sharp instrument, such as a curette, and insert it into the bladder; and treat it within the body where it is painful.
Chapter 21.
Regarding the restoration of fractures when they are restored and approached with Roman medicine, and the member does not follow the natural course, it is said:
When a bone fracture is restored, and the member subtle and free does not follow the natural course, it is said that this is due to various causes: among which is the multitude of solutions of the limbs and the luxation of the foot that does not follow its course; or for excessive stricture of the limbs due to the prohibition of nutrients to reach the member; or for excessive embrocation; or for movement that is not at its proper time; or for lack of sanction in the body of the mouth and delicacy of the.
The first source sentence translates to:
And then place a bandage on the member, so that the bandage draws nourishment from it or continues to cause inflammation of the skin, if that nourishment returns to its natural form.
Capital. Twenty-second.
Of the treatment of the three-knuckled bones when they are restored incorrectly and prohibited from operating as they once did.
When one has returned to the member that was already treated for tortuosity and prominence of the three-knuckled bone, and it is for this reason that the member is deformed in form, but the member is not prohibited from natural operation, unless it is known that this member is of a different type of trinck.
It has already been found that many surgeons and restaurators have done this in our land; and this operation is greatly feared by those who perform it, because the quality of the one who performs it is mortal.
If claudication and nodification are recent, it is likely that they are caused by water in the skin of the feet, which is softened by moisture, as the flesh of the legs is soft and mellow, and resembles those; and it should be made with the same plaster as the plaster for mollification, as it is said to be well made; or that it is a mixture of grease from the leg and gray oil or olive oil, and it is applied to that; or that they are fatty lumps and are tied with strings of femurs of the colon, and resemble those of medicines that are used for consolidation.
When certain women are dissolved by frequent rubbing of the skin that is moist and the member is moved in all parts at all hours.
If tortuosity has already become established and is hard and converted into stone and necessity arises for medical treatment of the iron, you should know that the pus is located under the skin and the continuance of the bone is dissolved, and it should be kept in mind that excess nodes of those metals in the bones are cut off with sharp knives, and there is facilitated assistance in that suffering and study.
Chapter 23.
A speech on dislocation.
Dislocation is an injury to one of the joints of the thigh bone, which prohibits movement and causes the figure of the member to be distorted, and large pains and wounds come over the buttock.
Therefore, when an accident occurs in the case of dislocation, you should perforate as much as possible to reduce it, and do not delay in reducing it, for if it is delayed, the location becomes affected and it is difficult to reduce the dislocation.
When it is not desired that there be blood or swelling at the time of the castration, four ways are seen to come: four spasms and pains lead.
When this happens, it is necessary that you cut the thigh at the castration, and place your hand inside where the apostemacio pauses; and the member should be tied with wet tail and tail hair, and the part should be made easier.
And all parts of the body are treated as this one, where the memorandum will come in its place.
And you have already ordered the capsules of displacement according to what is preceded in fracture; from the part of the chest that has been separated, go inside to the part that has been separated further.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of displacement of the jaw further.
If the dislocated teeth do not come back; and the displacement of the teeth is caused by one of two ways: either they are loosened by little removal, and then softened a little; or they are completely dislocated and compressed, inside where they are mollified at the joint between the thigh and the saliva of the foot and they do not have to hold their mouth closed, and the tongue of the patient is enveloped in the fold.
When the dislocation of the joint is slight, it returns to its original position on its own for no apparent reason.
If the dislocation is complete and comprehensive, it is necessary to administer a reduction of the joint as soon as possible, without delaying for too long.
And is it that the physician holds the thigh of the patient, and inserts the thumb of the hand into the joint, taking care to push the jaw forward in one direction or the other, depending on whether it is a single or double dislocation; and commands the patient to close their mouth and release any force applied; and the physician then engages the mandible and extracts it as it returns to its original position.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if the mandibles are found to be dislocated, administer a poultice of water and oil, and when it is slightly reduced, do not delay the reduction of the remaining mandibles, as they have been said.
When the patient returns and closes their mouth, and the wound of the leg is not chewed, then place your hand over those powders of scented wool, and make a point of beeswax and rose oil; and also make a point of making it easier to remove the stools.
And let the patient lie on their back, and their head be between two ears, so that it does not cause any harm to the part downward or to the left; and do not force any cause; if the back is fastened with a leopard's collar, then when the pains become more intense and the mandibles are notched, you should know that it is proper.
And if it is administered with ease, and you do not work on the edge of the mouth, but rather on the food, drink, and excretion, then if the mandible is notched and healed.
If it is difficult to reduce two jaws when they are dislocated at any time and not converted into their proper places, then you should use gentle movements that cause fevers and sweating, and much pain in the stomach of the patient, and much vomiting of pure choler.
When you see that the pain is coming, you will know that it is gout; and the following days, watch well for which part of the body it affects.
Chapter 25.
Of reducing the displacement of the shoulder girdle and the end of the muscle.
The shoulder girdle is not dislocated from the latch of the hand by its continuous action on the chest; and sometimes it is dislocated at the wrong place, and that is declared by the feeling.
And the restoration of the one is to put the thigh over the right knee and extend the thigh bones. And carefully mark the place with your hand with a strong marking, so that it returns to its original position.
And stop over that plaster and powder and stretch it.
If the end of that which is placed on the cushion is continuously in it, it is not dislocated at any time; you must reduce and hold it according to what has been said and according to what appears to you.
And stop over that plaster and powder and stretch it, and command the thigh to stick to the hollow and to return to its original position as soon as it is healed.
This measure of treatment reduces the end of the muscle when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the displacement of the muscle.
You know that the muscle is not displaced unless by three ways, of which one is that it is displaced from the beginning of the thigh to the end.
And the second is that it is displaced at the beginning of the muscle, and this is made tight; and it is not displaced in the rear by the shoulder; and it is not displaced in the front by the nerves.
And it is mostly displaced and deformed and stretched at the ends of the thigh, and more so in those where the bones are few, less so in those where the muscles are many; and it is more difficult to stretch them out.
And more often it happens to one man by percussion or by pressure, and the muscle of that man is affected with cautery, and this is why it is already displaced.
When you are about to enter and assist the patient who is lying down, and you proceed with the cure.
It is known that the dislocation of the joint is indicated when it is found outside the parts opposite to each other. Therefore, you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the surrounding muscle, and between the convexity of the muscle and the tendon that you press with your finger at the end of the muscle as if it were a horse's tail, and you cannot reduce the joint back to its original position for all movements.
If it is dislocated, you need to reduce or manipulate the joint, and you press with your finger at the end of the muscle as if it were a horse's tail, and do not hesitate.
And this dislocation is made with a slight reduction when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of the joint is that the attendant raises the limb of the patient to the opposite parts; and places his hand on the end of the dislocated joint, and strengthens it in its original position, and the attendant raises the limb of the patient, and extends it therein; and places his hand on the end of the joint, and returns it gently.
If the pain does not return after the first application, and it was caused by dislocation, it may take several days for the ankle to heal and be properly managed with a poultice of aloe vera, fenugreek, and honey, applied several times a day.
Then the ankle should be placed on the patient's back and the tightness of the wait for wool that is between the levator and stricture is reduced, and the doctor should place the knee on the hip, raise the head of the muscle, and pull the ankle away from the parts already done, and another servant holds the ankle so that it does not cause any pain in the parts already done, until such time as it returns to its original position.
If you want to reduce the second part of this maneuver: and it is that you present a man who has been stretched for a long time, and is from the side of that leg, and enters the patient's knee the tightness of the ankle and raises the ankle above the parts that the ankle is suspended in the air, and another servant pulls the ankle away from the parts already done on the side of the abdomen. If the thigh is lame, you should cover that which is causing it to hang down, so that it is as heavy as possible, in order that the dislocation may return as soon as possible.
And if it is reduced and the hand is left in the ground, a long stone with the head of it being like a skull, as hard as mortar but not big or thin, and placed next to the thigh of the patient; push that the hand is on the top of the stone's head, and the thigh is stationary according to the length of the stone, and extend the arm of the patient to the other side of the other part; and extend the body of the patient to the other part for strength, so that the joint returns to its original position quickly.
And if it is difficult to reduce the thigh by all the causes that have been said, then use this treatment: and you take a stone of the quantity which is in the length of two braces, and the width of which is four times, and the largest part of it is placed at the top of the sitting bone according to this form:
When one should touch the head of the bed with a cloth to prevent the patient from falling off the bed.
Then place your hand on the head of the bed, and extend your arm or your arm over the patient's shoulder, and see if the hand is visible to the assistant and the arm and the end of the hand.
Then place your arm on a scale according to the latitude, and extend your hand to the sides, and the rest is suspended from the other side, so that the joint does not move as much.
And when the wound of the foot is completed according to your ability, and you notice that the hand holds the head with a piece of yarn; and then apply a plaster prepared with powdered soap and almond oil over all the muscle, as it is rotating, and then tighten the head more on the plaster, and the hand of the foot is anchored to the neck of the foot, and it is less, and not bad for seven days.
When the wound of the patient is closed and the member is comfortable, then it is appropriate to apply the remedy to the sick person.
And if the wound is given more blood or exercise, and it does not become inflamed, then it is already cured.
If the joint is dislocated due to moisture that occurs in the patient or for another reason, then it is appropriate to apply cauterization with three points, according to what is said in the capital of cauterization.
And if everything is done and the wound gradually heals, and the plaster and stricture are reduced over some days, and it does not close and cannot lift the arm to the parts above, then you know that the nerves of the patient, which are at the top of the muscle, have been injured or extended or softened, and you know that the joint will not remain in place for a long time.
From the dislocation of that which is made, you need the chest and breast or the parts behind, reduction is made by compression and extension to the largest extent possible, within which it returns.
When administered in that manner, and cared for as directed, it will heal the wound that is being treated.
If the injury becomes severe in the member and causes delay in movement, then use warm poultices made from boiled herbs that have been applied to relieve the pain and return to the original state of the primary member.
Chapter 27.
Of the cure for a dislocated thigh.
You know that the joint of the thigh is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated at all parts, and particularly at the part nearest to the part behind, and the dislocation of the thigh is not avoided by you when you are tense or when you are relaxed, as long as any other part is dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated thigh, you declare it clearly, that the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor touch that the nearby muscle.
And cover the joints, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible so that it comes to the acupuncture point, where if you can reach the acupuncture point, it is difficult to reduce the dislocation, and then not all of it will heal; and especially when it reaches the distant parts, where all other types of dislocations are caused by a lot of pain and warm poultices applied to that part.
When restoring the body, when it is possible to reduce, it is that the body of the patient should be extended as much as possible, and the arms should be expanded, and the hands of the doctor are over the thighs and below him, and he punctures the joint with his fingers or with the tip of his thumb, entering it into its place.
If the dislocation is to the adjacent parts, then return as if you fold the body over itself, entering it with the thumb of your hand.
And if the dislocation does not comply with the reduction, then administer vehement extension and strong movement.
And if two ministers extend the arms, and hold that extension with those ministers so that it is not weakened by the extension.
And if it is necessary to rotate the arms, then turn them completely, pushing that it unrolls doubled long over the body of the patient, or limb.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, use that ointment on it for so that those causes that help in the lubrication of the joint are facilitated; and then press the joint with a strong push when it returns.
When reducing the cover that is placed over that bandage which is sterilized and exfoliated with albumen of honey, and is extended over the stricture descent, and the arm is suspended from the collarbone, and is left for several days.
And if it is slid; and then, if the joint is formed in the right place, you slide the limb of the patient and leave it there.
And if you see that the joint is not tightened, you repeat the bandage and the limb of the patient, and leave it for several days after it is extended; then slide it.
If the patient's gravity causes a reduction in the joint, and the disposition of the limb is in movement, you administer humidification in the bath and gentle friction, and compression, after it is freed; or you place over the reduced joint, so it is the fatty part of the body; and then slide the limb, and leave it on the day and night. And keep that, and put it in the bath; and when you dry it, you gently rub the joint with temperature-adjusted friction, and repeat over the reduced one, which is rolling of movement, one way, and the other, and the third. When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily
If you wish, stop on that wet and slippery cow blade and press down hard on it, and make some holes, cut through the wet part and reduce it to its proper size.
Chapter 28.
The treatment of shoulder dislocation is from the joint that is between the arm and the chest.
When the shoulder is dislocated, and its reduction is difficult, and it is faster in the reduction of other joints, but rather because of the speed of the reduction in the hour in which it is dislocated, whether it is in an asthenic or cautive state.
And the reduction of the shoulder dislocation is that you place the joint of the shoulder of the chest on a table and extend the shoulder of that, and you press your hand or palm on the edge of the joint, and push it inside until it returns to its original location.
May well cover that if the palm has already been placed on the abdomen of the patient, then make the thigh pause over the two of the patient's thighs on a table for extension and reduction; and if dislocation precedes the two of the patient's thighs, then place the position of the patient's thigh on that intrinsically on the table, so that the doctor's hand covers the imminence of the joint.
If the swelling returns so much, that is good; but if not, then tighten that part as much as possible, and do not stop until it stops, for if it does not stop, neither will it be able to reduce the pus that passes on those days.
However, the joint pain follows its winding; and I do not notice any cause in the thigh, except that it is softened and cannot be strengthened by any cause; you should know that the nerves are divided or cut, and you do not engage in it unless it is stretched as much as possible with a cord and the force of the cauterization confirms some cause.
Therefore, when the swelling returns, stop on the part that has been recommended, and let it be loosened and tightened for several days; and then gradually release and relax the muscle of the foot and exercise it.
However, if the movement of the foot is left and happens to be severe, you should loosen that part as much as possible, and apply some oil to relieve any pain, and enter if necessary.

When a bone is dislocated from the thumb to the abdomen of the patient, if you hold it and push it back into its place, then return it.
Then hold the head of the dislocated bone, suspend the finger above the part where it is dislocated, and release it after two days.
Then suspend the finger and extend it when it is straight in that day.
When you wake up, read that second part of the story, and do not slothfully slide it in the day and exercise it with movement, and hold it straight; and keep doing this for several days after it is straight.
And make it seem like this, if it is dislocated in the abdomen of the patient, and hold it at that part and do the first surgical operation, and when it is healed, you will be cured.
And similarly, when you are dislocated in other parts.

Of the care of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When you encounter a complete dislocation of any vertebra of the back or neck, and if there are other vertebrae in those places, do not cure them in that place, for death will come to the abdomen.
When it comes to the matter of gout, it is known that the excretion of the foot is expelled outside of one's will, and cannot be held back; and if one has watched this for a while, it softens the members of the body or the changes in the body or the two parts of the body, or one of those; or it becomes a vertebra of that place, wherever it is watched, and whatever is watched becomes the removal of those four parts.
Therefore, that has been adjusted to the back parts and is not causing any discomfort.
The treatment of the matter is that if the gout occurs due to purification, which is not treated in that part, then it is not cured nor healed in that part.
In that part where there is pain due to caustication or percussion or seemingly from those, the ancients had many ways of treatment, which was not profitable; and you have been introduced to that of which too much was used from too much heat, due to the proximity of the exposed part, which I have exposed and formed with different instruments of that, as I showed you and applied to that.
And of those, none is cured except the one that occurs in the two parts mentioned by me as you recommend.
And if the thigh is extended over the face, covering almost the entire part, and it is extended further down the stomach to prevent the chest from being hurt.
And if a cushion is placed, it should be placed on the ground at the end of the thigh near the head of the patient, and another cushion should be placed on the other end of the thigh to hold the feet.
The doctor holds the cushion, and does not stop in the ditch; and another doctor holds the other side in that form.
And the doctor wraps around the thigh and presses the leash on the belly; and extends the end of the leash to the cushion that is needed for the head of the patient, and fastens it there; and stretches the other leash over the knees of the patient's legs, and adjusts all the leashes and fastens them on the other cushion that is needed for the feet of the patient.
And if the minister of the cushion extends the limb to the point of the foot, and there are no remaining problems with the two feet and limbs in which they are stuck, but rather it is not stopped by anything, then it should be done as they have said.
And the doctor places his hands over the spine for strength until it returns, or if he places them on one table, and adjusts the weight of the legs as they return.
If it does not return in this way, then one must take a table where the latitude or longitude is in the middle of three bars, and dig into the side of the table where they have said that the mast is located in the middle of the extremities of the table. And the doctor places the mast of the table over the spine, and the doctor places the legs on the other end, and stretches as soon as the spine is straight and returns to its original position.
And if you wish, open the mast that is turned around the mast; and it should be placed on the ground because the mast of the mast is at the end of the two feet, the longitude of which is a hand's breadth, and the mast must be placed in the end of the foot with the other foot, and the longitude that is between one foot and the palm of the hand, and it has been made in each foot as it returns, and each part must be fixed on the ground because it is not injured.
When a person has a broken bone, it is important to clean and dress the wound as soon as possible to prevent infection. The first step is to clean the wound with soap and water, then apply a sterile bandage or gauze to cover the wound. It is also important to keep the affected area clean and dry to
In the end of the bone, there is a groove in which the bone is formed, and its length is approximately equal to the length of the palm of your hand. In the other two bones, it looks similar to this.
Then tighten the ligaments that you have tied in the chest area in the truss that you need to wear on your head, and the ligaments that you have tied in the thighs in the wound that you need to wear on your feet.
Then each wound should have a dressing that covers it, and the surgeon will remove the old dressing and replace it with a new one according to what has been said.
Then the spine is returned to its place, and the area is covered with a bandage. You should cover the wound with a piece of gauze that is slightly larger than the size of the wound, and then secure it with tape. Over the gauze, you can apply a cold compress made of ice or a wet cloth, and place it over the area where the spine was injured.
When you have found the cause of the pain that has been described, and use the appropriate nourishment subtly within the body.
If you find any signs of inflammation in the location at the end of the treatment, it is necessary to administer medications that nourish and lubricate the administration of the table for a long time, as has been recommended; and the medication has already been administered in that place.
If there are any signs of imminent inflammation in the back of the spinal columns of both sides, and it is caused by that dislocation; and if those bones have already been injured for which this medicine is not effective, then you should take great care to prevent your death.

Of the cure for a dislocated ankle.
You know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the muscle do not always mean dislocation, and do not happen to those that happen to the other small removals and concavities.
And when the joint of the ankle is dislocated, it happens in four ways: either in the parts of the fingers, or in the parts of the toes, or in the parts of the nails, or in the parts behind.
When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When you suspect that the thigh bone is dislocated from its proper place, and when you adjust the saddle of the healthy thigh against the sick one, it becomes long and the knee bends more than the healthy one, and the thigh cannot bend the knee as before, and the place where it should be pressed to apply cautery, because the end of the thigh bone has already reached here.
The first source sentence translates to: The reason for the dislocation of that which causes an accident is in the parts that are opposite, because the accidents of this are against those.
When there is pain in the joint due to dislocation of the limb, and the swelling expands the surrounding muscles, but does not cause pain in the affected part, and if it perforates to go further and cannot be stopped on the surrounding parts; and the urine of the patient is retained and the urethra is blocked, and you must cover the limb with the ambulance over the heel.
When the part of the thigh that is dislocated expands the nail, and it does not double over the nail that doubles around it, and the camba of the thigh is shorter than the other, and the nail is mollified, then the end of the thigh is at that place.
The first source sentence translates to: "The most effective reduction of the specimens in this dislocation is what you consider, doctor, if the dislocation is ancient and antiquated, which has already been anticipated with that administration of reduction of this and Roman second according to its disposition, doctor; and therefore, it does not seem that in that there is a true wonder.
When the dislocation is recent in that area, and it is one of the four types of dislocations, then you should cut along the line that you saw the joint move and extend it to the parts of the fingers and thumbs, and also to the parts of the little finger and ring finger, and it will return if not requiring another treatment.
If the dislocation does not return in this hand, then you should prepare for strong force and extend the camber of the thumb from there, or on the side that is most comfortable for you, or on the side that is visible over the camber; and extend the end of that camber as far as the tips of the fingers; and apply strong pressure on the root of the thigh, and hold another hand on the extremity of the limb.
And if it is extension of the limb or of the finger to the angle of the elbow, or to the angle of the back of the hand.
And if it is extension of all those in a straight line when the thigh is raised and the side that is closest to the earth is hanging down.
This method of extension is specific to all four.
If displacement returns as they say, then do so; otherwise, you will need everything possible to speak about the doctor's treatment.
In the reduction of the own, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is to the joint parts, know that the thigh should be flexed over the knee; and place the limbs on the side of the thigh in the place where the head of the thigh meets the place where the knee is located; and extend the limb from the part of the shoulder to the other part of the girdle.
And if another minister forcefully takes the handles of it and makes the large opening of the patient's thigh wider and extends the parts around for a firm hold, so that it returns to its place.
And this species is used with less care than the others in which this member is reduced.
If you are excused from me and do not obey the entry of this species of care for everything, know that the two feet of the thigh are often tied with a strong, thin limb over the ankles and over the knees.
And the length of each part is according to the quantity of four fingers, and the thigh's girdle is extended more than the other by two fingers.
When the patient's thigh is suspended over the chin, and it is in the largest part; and the length of the thigh is the quantity of two braces.
And order a young man to cut off the head of the thigh, and suspend it at the foot of another young man, and the other young man will cut off the thigh with strength, so that the joint returns to its original location quickly.
In the reduction, when there is a dislocation at the end of the part, it is necessary that the thigh be placed over the pug according to what has been recommended in the case; and the limb should be tightened on the real hip and on the chest of the patient.
And if two thighs are placed, one on the foot of the patient, and the other on the head; and if the thighs are adjusted to the peg that is placed over which parts are humid, so that the thigh does not get stuck because the foot is between the thighs of the patient, so that you have to extend the parts further, it will not be torn.
And every physician extends to their part, and they place the cautery in their hand and perform the reduction according to the art.
When the dislocation is in its place, it is important that the cushion is extended slightly, and follows this method according to the report; and the physician places the palm of their hand on the affected part, and the other hand on the other cushion, and the cushion stops the extension on the part that was dislocated.
If the dislocation is behind, it is not important that the cushion is extended to the parts in front, and it should be raised on the ground; if there is a hard cause, ask how the pain is felt when the thigh of the patient is dislocated in the wrong direction, according to what has been said about the joint of the thigh on two sides; and the cushion is on their face and the limbs are extended, according to what has been said, it has not hurt.
When it comes to administering compression, place the table over the location where you wish to apply the joint pain relief.
Then, when the reduction is complete - and the sign of reduction is not visible to you, and it is because you extend from the thighs, and when you see those knees and the thigh extends the chamber and expands that hole, then you know that the member that was reduced - and you adjust the thighs and stop pressing and extend a band that is not wide in any of the parts; and adhere the thigh to the supports for three days or for four.
And then remove the bandage and compare one chamber to another.
If you see those knees in position, you know that the dislocation is already fixed, and then let the thigh go.
And if you see any cause of softening, then you return and apply that to your first stretch, and let it be expanded for three days.
If that is the case, and it should wait in bed for a few days until it is comfortable.
Capital, Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
The shoulder is dislocated by three parts, namely the head, the neck, and the glenoid cavity. The head is not dislocated.
And the sign of shoulder dislocation is that the patient commands the thigh to apply its cushion to the buttock; you should know that the shoulder is dislocated.
And the restoration of all the limbs of the shoulder is that you stretch the thigh to the buttock, if it can reach the extended knee; you should adhere the upper part of the thigh to the face of the patient, and place the foot of the patient between the thighs of the patient; and you should adhere the shoulder of the patient to your palms, and stretch those between the thighs of the patient over the shoulder of the patient for strength, and other ministers extend the knee if the shoulder returns to its place.
When it comes to the matter of the patient's labor, his or her girdle should hold tightly to the thigh, not causing any discomfort.
And apply that and let the bandage adhere to the thigh, and apply those emplacements with a needle for three days or four, and then remove them.
And do not use the thigh's bandage for more than a few days, until it is healed and comfortable.
If the reduction of the foot is successful, then administer extra care with those instruments used in the treatment of the previous injury.
Chapter xxxiii.
Of the treatment of the dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle has some joints that can be reduced by small removal, and some have been dislocated secondarily, and the dislocation of the ankle is made or at the ends of the fingers or at the ends of the toes.
And the sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that sometimes the ankle becomes flattened at the place where it was dislocated.
The treatment of the reduction of the ankle is of little benefit, and it is that it is extended as much as possible within the limits and then returned.
When in the care of the patient when the leg is dislocated, take the thigh and hold it firmly in the part behind the other leg in the patient's lying position.
And if you have the second leg straight and the foot of the affected foot in front of it, hold the left foot of the other foot in front of the affected foot's foot in the cavity.
And pull the foot of the affected leg towards you and hold the left hand with your right, and extend the left arm; and push the chest of the affected leg with the other hand.
And make the necessary movements according to what has been counted.
And push the chest with the other hand towards the cavity.
Then if you return in one direction or two according to this manual, and if you see the foot has come out, stop; and otherwise continue the operation, making that return.
If you are not allowed to reduce the leg as advised, place the thigh on the table over the ground, and stretch a rope on the ground that fits between the patient's thighs, and you have already covered the leg with a cloth so that the leg does not come out of the cavity.
When the minister holds the patient's thighs, and another minister extends the foot over the patient's most or the limb that lies on the collar of the foot; and extends that same minister against the extension of the bed part, and the pillow is placed between the patient's thighs retained by it, so that this part of the bed does not extend beyond its extension.
When the mason dislocates the joint with the healthier leg, and another servant holds the thigh firmly in its place, so that the dislocation returns to ease.
When the dislocation returns and is declared to you as the health of the reduction, pause plastering and extend that part firmly, and tie the foot to the cushion.
And remember that you do not fear or protect the nerves that are behind the talus, so that the limb over that does not become strong and leads to strength.
And hold it for two days or three; and if the limb becomes soft, extend that part.
When the swelling on that part appears on the third or fourth day, and forbids the patient from walking for fourteen days. If it is not safe to walk in that space, then it is not certain that the dislocation is not over the dissolved and corrupted part, and therefore it does not receive care.
And if an abscess occurs in that place, you should cover the wound with the urine of the aquatic animal we mentioned earlier, in another place of care and dressing, if it is useful.
Capital. xxxiv.
Of the care of the dislocation of the three parts of the foot.
Cover that the one who is dislocated should be cut with little extension of its parts; and that is not difficult, it is enough to make a small cut.
If the dislocation is in the two nails of the foot, you should cover that you make a cut on the skin or table, and it should be done as if it were not there.
And if you are in the foot, and place your hand on that part where the joints are, and then heat it with something that is not hot, and after you remove it, and see that it is cut and does not appear in the most prominent place.
And then, pause the belly of the foot of the patient on a table that grabs the entire foot, which has two cups, and press it gently and firmly for three days; and then remove it and make it heal through ambulation for three days, until it is stretched and reduced in size.
Capitulare .xxxv.
Of the special causes of displacement that are caused by pain or fracture or other injuries.
When any of those causes occurs, and you take care of the patient's cure and restoration, successful results are often seen in life.
And therefore, it is not presumed that the cure of the patient depends solely on long practice, mercy, and compassion, but rather on the art, which is gradual, not arrogant or presumptuous; and it should be used at the beginning of medicine, not only for those who are in despair, but also for the alleviation of pain, and in which there is some hope. And then you should make every effort to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, since it will eventually lead to gout.
And if the member returns shortly after you want it, administer the regimen that reduces gout and cures the plague, as is appropriate for the patient's condition.
And if dislocation is mistaken for fracture and occurs in the separated bones of the pelvis, you should pierce the statement of those, and make sure that they have said in the simple ailments of this that it is preceded in the places of those.
And guard and avoid afterwards that of the intramission in the ways of fear, following that it precedes my preaching; four this is better for you to have the true Creator, and less permanent for your glory, and less salutations to the one who sees those in their time. I hope these paragraphs of Albucasim are perfectly understood by God. Amen.
