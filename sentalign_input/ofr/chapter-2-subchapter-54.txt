of dropsy/edema
We have already spoken in the division about the appearances of dropsy/edema, and in what manner the collection of water is made, and the signs of each type, and the treatment that is done with medicines, and that which is treated with iron: so is only eclites (a type of dropsy); and one should not touch with iron these two types: namely, tympanites (abdominal swelling) and yposarche (another type of dropsy), for it is a mortal thing; so when you treat this type of dropsy/edema which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment is not effective, consider if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy/edema, such as a cough and loose bowels and similar things; do not touch it with iron, for there is danger; and if you see the patient is of strong constitution, and they have no other illness than dropsy/edema only, and they are not too young nor too old, you should proceed as follows: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and an assistant presses the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the abdomen, then take the pointed scalpel according to this form:
And it should be sharp on both sides.
with a point, and yet not so penetrating that it could reach the intestine when inserted, and could injure it; then see if the dropsy/edema is generated towards the intestines: you must cut above the navel three fingers directly below the xiphoid process; and if the dropsy/edema is due to liver disease, let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers; and if it is due to the spleen, let it be to the right, and the patient must not lie on the incision so that the excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot; then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and insert it, and lift your hand with the whole scalpel between the skin and the superficial fascia as if skinning to the width of a fingernail or thereabouts; then pierce the superficial fascia until the scalpel reaches the empty space, and this is the location of the water, then withdraw it, and insert this instrument of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and it is made of brass or light bronze, and has at the lower part a small hole; and on the side on one part, three holes; and two on the other part, and one on the other; and the head is cut like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the pen:
at the top is the wing, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately descends onto the instrument; then empty half or a third, for if you empty more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the release of their spirit or soul, or they will faint, or they will approach death; but empty it according to the amount of their strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength indicate, and their pulse; then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is held back now by the core which plugs the hole that is on the superficial fascia, of which I spoke, that you pierce in this manner; then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small amount of water; do this for a few days, and be careful not to drain so much that there remains no more than a little water. 
And if you are worried about the patient, and you leave a lot of water, then treat them with burial in warm sand, and with a lot of sweating or baths and in the sun, and let them abstain from drinking; and treat them with drying medicines until they are healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
