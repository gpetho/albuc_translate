Of the limb that is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin, it happens for many reasons: one is that it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bindings, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of too much washing; or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because there is little blood in the body, making it weak.
And the cure is to make the patient eat well, and make the body plump, so that the blood multiplies in them; and administer baths, and give them joy and happiness; then apply poultices to the limb, so that the poultice draws great nourishment to it, and frequently wash it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural shape.
