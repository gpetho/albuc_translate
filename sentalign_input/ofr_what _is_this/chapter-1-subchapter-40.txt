Of the hip
When viscous humors descend to the hip socket, and for this reason it moves out of place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when they are measured together; and the place of the separation is found empty, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the hip socket with a cautery resembling a circle, and mark in front around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is inside the circle; and let the cautery be like the one with which the stomach was cauterized.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cautery be as deep as the skin; and treat it until it is healed.
