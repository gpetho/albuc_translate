of the flesh on the nose
Sometimes there grow in the nose diverse fleshy additions, some of which resemble scorpions with many feet; and there are some such that there is flesh ingrained with a pale colour, and some have soft flesh of good colour.
In this case, for those fleshy growths which are soft, and not ingrained, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open their nostrils, and cast the hook at those fleshy growths, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with the fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the flesh is entirely removed.
And if any part remains that cannot be cut, then open it with one of the fine instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if the blood overcomes you, or a hot abscess forms, treat it as needed; and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stanched and all the flesh removed, then put a mixture of water and vinegar or wine into the nose.
If the nose opens, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed; and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that flesh has grown on the bone above, which the instrument cannot reach to cut: then you must insert a somewhat thick linen thread, knotted with many knots, and having between each knot a space of a finger or less; and have the patient put the end of the thread into his nose as far as he can, and pull while inhaling until it comes through the nose into the mouth; and children in schools often do this, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it; then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, pulling on the knots that are in the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have broken down that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back into the nose as before; do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh; and then put a lead tube in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if there is need for drying medications, use them; and this is the form of the instrument for cleansing the head, with which oils and medications are distilled into the nose:
And let it be of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise; and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full for cleansing the head; and let it have a handle at the end for holding it when heating the oil or some liquid.
