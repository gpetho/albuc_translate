On cauterization of a dislocated hip.	On the Method of Cauterizing the Hip in Dislocation	0.62815386
Sometimes harmful humidities reach the hip joint and result in its coming out of its place. The symptom of this is that one leg is longer than the other when one is measured against the other; and a hollow is found there [i.e. at the hip].	When mucus-like humors flow into the hip socket, causing it to dislocate, one leg will appear longer than the other when compared, and there will be an empty space at the dislocation site.	0.6018658
Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle. The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach.	It is necessary to cauterize the patient over the hip socket using a circular cautery. First, mark around the hip with ink, following its contour, so that the hip joint falls within the center of the circle.	0.8052001
But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery. The burn should be to the depth of the whole thickness of the skin.	If this circular cautery is not available, then apply three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery, with a depth equal to the skinâ€™s full thickness.	0.78356934
