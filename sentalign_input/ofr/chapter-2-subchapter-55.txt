On the blockage of the penis/ urethra
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
It is therefore necessary as soon as he is born to pierce it with a very fine scalpel / lancet according to this form/method:
Then put in the opening a thin nail of lead, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days, and when he needs to urinate, the nail should be removed, and he should urinate, and then replace it; and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes out prevents it from closing.
He whose opening is small, he is treated with the lead nail, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the tip of the penis, because of which they cannot urinate forward unless they lift their penis up; and they cannot procreate because the semen cannot come down to the womb, and this is a bad condition.
And the method of the procedure is that the patient lies on his back, then stretches the head of the penis and cuts it like the cut of a quill, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should; and be wary of bleeding that often occurs there, and if it happens, stop it with something that stops blood, and treat the wound until he is healed.
