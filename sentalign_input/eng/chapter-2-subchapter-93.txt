 CHAPTER NINETY-THREE.
On incision for the disease known as 'flitting disease'.
The disease known in our region as 'the flitting disease' is a pain arising in a limb and then passing from limb to limb.
I have personally seen it as I shall describe to you: I was called to a woman patient in a country district, who uncovered her arm and showed me a small inflation of the cephalic vein.
After I had waited a while I saw the swelling creep like a worm along the forearm, ascending towards her shoulder, with the greatest possible speed, as of quicksilver running from place to place.
Then the pain left that place and settled in the elbow.
Then I waited a while and the pain ran through the whole body until it reached the other arm.
Then she related to me that it used to pass all round her body as I had seen it.
I was amazed at the speed with which it migrated from one part to another, as I had never before seen this disease in this form, though I had seen many who had a pain that passed from limb to limb; but never with my own eyes had I seen anything like what I saw in this woman.
The only opinion I could form of it was that it was due to the woman's being of the dwellers in the wilds, dry of body, with outstanding veins, and hence that moving vapour was perceptible.
But it follows then that it does not appear in that manner in people leading a leisured life, with humid bodies and hidden veins.
When you want to cure this, and the patient feels the pain of it, and if you observe the appearance we have described, then tie a bandage round above and beneath it as quickly as possible and cut down on it so that the vapour enclosed there may come out; and cauterize the place.
But if there is nothing visible to you then treat by purging of the body and by medicines dispelling and getting rid of flatus, such as foetid pills and pills of sagapenon and the like.
