O you, my very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine along with its completion, and have made its end through its expositions and declarations.
And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery."
And because the work of hands is withdrawn in our region and is completely foreign, thus the science is perished and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that hands have changed.
And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I wish to revive it together with the organization of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and of abbreviation;
and I will come with the forms of iron instruments for cautery, and of other instruments of the work with the addition of declaration and preparation of it, as is needed.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distanced.
And it behooves one who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so much that he knows the arrangement of members, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of bones and nerves and arms and their number, and the movement and of moving veins and resting ones, and of their place of origin.
And for this Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little;
and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things should take care that he does not fall into error and that he does not kill men;
thus I have seen many times several of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an aposteme of scrofula on a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck;
wherefore so much blood came out that the woman fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from a man of age, and the stone was large;
thus he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man was dead within 3 days.
And I had already been called there to extract it, and saw the disposition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew well if one cut him he would die.
And I saw another physician who took into care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break had a wound;
and the physician full of ignorance tightened the break over the wound with splints by strong binding, and did not leave any opening for the wound, and left it thus for a time;
and commanded him not to unbind it;
and remained thus that the leg became all swollen and the foot and came to perdition.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come unbind the leg;
And when I had untied it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
However, the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and then it became inflamed due to his poor treatment.
For cancer, when it is purely from melancholic humor, one should not touch it with iron unless it is in such a place where one can completely remove what is corrupted.
And for this, dearest son, you need to know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions:
that is to say, work where there is danger in multiple situations;
and I will show in each part of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you take care, so that foolish physicians cannot speak ill of you.
Take up your instruments with care, and treat your patients gently and firmly, and use the best method so that by God's grace you may come to success and be praised;
and leave the frightening diseases of difficult healing;
and remove your instruments from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions:
"Do not take on the treatment of a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish physician."
I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterization by fire and cauterization by strong medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and about the forms of instruments, and the iron tools for cauterization, and about all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and about cupping glasses and wounds, and about the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and includes the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is ordered from the head to the feet, and about the forms of instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the quality of help and harm is the longest discourse and subtle science and hidden secrets;
and many of the wise spoke of this, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear lengthiness.
I say that cauterization helps universally for every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions:
that is to say hot complexion without matter, and dry complexion without matter.
In hot and dry complexion together with matter, some divided and said that cauterization is of great help;
and others said the contrary:
that cauterization is not worth anything for illness that comes from heat and dryness.
For the nature of fire is hot, and one must not cure a hot illness with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the contrary says that cauterization provides great help for hot and dry illness that comes in men's bodies.
For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement.
For I have found it sometimes through experiment.
And yet, none should undertake it except those who have tested it, and who know through long practice the chapter on cauterizations, and the diversity of men's constitutions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the span of time;
for other constitutions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist diseases.
And all physicians gathered and agreed on cauterization.
And know, son, that cauterization with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cauterization with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and only affects the member that is cooked, and hardly harms any other member.
Burning medicines travel from member to member at a distance, and bring to the member diseases difficult to heal;
and by chance kill the patient.
Fire, by its nobility and by the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and stayed upon the truth of things;
and for this I excuse myself for the length of speech, for it does not please me to hide from you the secret that is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it drives away diseases from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstration;
now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauterizations should be done, and chose spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable in all seasons, because the occurring harm is subdued by the help of cauterization;
and especially if the cauterizations are for severe and urgent necessary pains that cannot wait for the time lest greater malice come to the member.
And never think, dear son, as do foolish physicians;
for the disease that is healed by cauterization has no return;
and they say it thus;
but it is not as they believe, because cauterization is nothing but medicine that changes the constitution, and dries the humors that are the cause of pain, and works better than medicine due to the hastiness of its value, and due to the virtue of its work and its lordship.
And it is possible that the disease comes sometimes according to the constitution of the patient and the location of the disease and its strength;
and superfluities are gathered in it through the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cauterization is administered in a place where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as cauterization of teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return;
but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cauterization is called the last of medicine, and this is true;
but they do not believe that cauterization works after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cauterization is the last of medicine because when we administer types of cures in some disease and they do not work, then we administer the cauterization, and it works.
Thus it appears well that cauterization is the last of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cauterization with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its substance;
and they said that the place of cauterization does not make rot, but this is not true for I have tested it, and have found that this is true in some men;
and cauterization with gold works better than with iron, as they said.
When you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools down quickly;
and if one heats it too much;
they melt in the fire;
and thus there are many impediments.
And for this reason we use iron cautery which we have better prepared for our work.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to feet, so that the path may be easier to find.
about the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is effective for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two that are made for a disease called "soda," and for various humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for numerous dreams and tooth pain and throat pain, and especially for all diseases that come from cold such as paralysis and deafness and apoplexy and similar diseases.
The method of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by purgative medicine cleansing the head for 3 or 4 nights, according to what the strength and age and constitution of the patient can bear;
and then have the patient's head shaved.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his chest;
after put the base of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes;
and where your middle finger comes, mark with ink then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which here is the form:
And put it on the spot marked with ink, and move downward while tightening your hand little by little while turning;
then quickly lift your hand, and look at the spot to see if you can see the bone a tiny bit;
and if you don't see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I told you;
then take a little salt, and put it in water and wet cotton in it, and put it on the spot, and leave it for 3 days;
after put cotton soaked in butter on it;
and leave it on until the burn is removed;
after treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon," until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges;
and therefore it helps better.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burnt, and then scrape what is burnt from the bone, and let it be treated.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so hard that one removes from the bone an area as wide as a spindle whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors may better come out;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time;
after one should treat it and close it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be entirely good, except in some men where there is a path of fear;
and it seems better to me that I should leave it;
for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members;
and especially when the patient's head is naturally weak, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it then together with health.
About chronic headache
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient must use iris and pills that are called "cochie", and purging of the head and oils and plasters;
and if one applies the cautery that we mentioned before, and it doesn't work.
Take note if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold;
then cauterize below that cautery a little that we mentioned above.
After that make a cautery on each corner of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels";
and it is a place where one puts cupping glasses;
and steady your hand so that you do not go down to the bone:
the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the corners be more subtle than those used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is the form:
about the cautery of the head
When sudden pain comes to one part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by cleansing medicines, and one has done the other treatments that I mentioned in the division of illnesses, and all this doesn't help:
then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say with sharp medicine and with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and remove the skin and cut it a little at both ends, and then split the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can hide the clove of garlic under the skin;
and when it will be hidden then bind it and tighten it well and leave it thus for twelve hours;
and then unbind it and pull out the clove of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days;
then put cotton soaked in butter on it until pus comes out.
After that treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want you can do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise about burning medicines.
The iron cautery is according to this method.
Heat the cautery of which here is the form:
And it is called "nail" because the head is made in the form of a nail where there is a little curve, and in the middle there is a small protrusion;
and put it on the painful place, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the skin is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery that is outside doesn't burn, and abundant blood flows.
After put cotton in salt water, and put it on the place for three days;
then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want cauterize this migraine with the cautery that is called "knife-like", with the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine that is not old.
about migraine
When you treat migraine as we have said before in divisions of illnesses, and it doesn't help, and you see that the aforementioned cauteries of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery that is called "knife-like" until it is white;
and first mark on the painful place a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and tighten it so that you don't cut the artery and that you don't go down to the bone;
and be careful of the mandible that moves when one eats, and the nerve has no regard that moves it and that spasm doesn't come to the patient, and be careful of blood flow from the artery when it will be cut, or cutting has great fear and especially to one who doesn't know about it, and who isn't studied and experienced;
and leave the work halfway;
but I will tell you how one stops blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you at the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is tolerant, cauterize the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter about arterial extraction, with the cautery that has two blades;
and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
On ear pain from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and one has worked with dissolving medicines and other treatments that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not move, then heat this cautery which is called "points," of which here is the form:
After that, make points all around the sick ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and stay a little away from the root of the ear after you have marked the place with ink;
and make 10 points around each ear;
afterwards treat the area until it is healed.
On the twisting of the mouth
Twisting that must be treated by cautery is only that which comes from phlegm, as we have said in the division of illnesses;
and do not apply cautery to conditions that come from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you treat this type of twisting that comes from phlegm of hydras and purging of the head and gargling, and this doesn't work, then you must cauterize the patient with 3 cauteries:
one at the root of the ear, another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and put the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery right at the head of the ear above a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb;
and leave the cautery on until half the core is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the knife-like one that we showed before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker;
afterwards treat the area as I said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it doesn't help, and the patient doesn't have fever, then make 4 cauteries:
Two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place called "vessels" as we said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
On lethargy
For this illness one must give the patient large doses and pills that purify the brain;
after shaving the patient's head completely, put on the occiput the mustard plaster that is written in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of the cautery:
make it as I have said.
If he is healed this way, good;
and if he isn't, make 3 cauteries from the middle of the head going down to the neck, and leave the space of one thick finger between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient is tolerant, make one cautery in the middle;
and if necessary, two others on the two horns, and treat until healed;
and let the cautery be the one called "olivare," as I said before.
On the coldness of the head
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of veins and of what we have mentioned before;
after shaving the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each corner, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you have more need, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is strong, then make four cauteries on the spine of the back;
and leave it until most of the flesh is burned, and lift your hand;
afterwards treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery be the one called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.
On epilepsy
The epileptic should not use cautery except for one who is phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain of veins and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is grown and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, then give him gargarism and mastication cleansing the brain often with good foods;
after shaving his head in the middle, and make one cautery according to what we have said before, and one cautery on the vessel, and on each corner;
and if the patient is strong and suffering, then make cauteries as I have said to the one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner I have said.
If the patient is a child, then make one subtle cautery according to this manner:
When due to melancholy the superfluities or moistures are corrupted and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with such cauteries as we have said for the one who has paralysis.
And if due to melancholy the superfluity is declining to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain will be cleansed, according to what is before in the division.
After shave the head of the patient;
after make a well-made linen ring, like a circle, and put it in the middle of the head;
and let the patient sit crossed, and be well held from all sides;
after present the liniment, and sheep's butter that is old is better;
and heat it on fire moderately, so that the finger if one puts it in can bear it;
after empty the circle from within in the middle of the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient each week once with other good governance, until he is healed.
Or if you wish cauterize it by making several points with all the cautery.
This manner of cautery moistens the brain equally;
and then put on cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
On water in the eyes
When water first comes to the eyes by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that cleanses the head, and guard him from all moistures, and make him sweat in the bath several times while fasting.
After command him to shave his head, and make cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one;
and cut with all the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the flesh, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard yourself from blood flow, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stanch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stanch it;
and sometimes one makes cautery in the nape below the two rear bones.
About the flow of tears
When tears from the eyes are old and habitual and are above the veins, or near the arteries that are visible on the outside of the head;
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning for the water descending to the eyes:
one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries on the nape below the two bones;
and if more is needed, then cauterize carefully above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
About the flow of tears inside the eyes
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient drink for three nights at bedtime;
afterwards shave their head, and make a cautery in the middle with the olive-shaped cautery;
and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and be careful not to cut the artery.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare."
of which here is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until a third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner I have described.
About hair that pricks the eye
Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes turn inward, and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two methods:
that is to say by fire, or by burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even;
and if they prick at their growth, hold the eyes closed so they don't move while they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your lap;
after, mark on the eyelid a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be next to the hairs;
then put cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
After, cauterize over the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the flesh is burned there;
and the sign of the health of the work is that you see the eyelid retracted, and the hairs raised from pricking the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then put cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed;
after, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the hairs come back, and the eyelid is softened then restart the cautery on the same place, as you did at first;
and if the hair is outside, cauterize it until the eyelid is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you command the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take French soap and quicklime, one ounce of each, and grind together well;
and do it hastily, so that it does not cool, then spread it over the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid;
and if the disease is in one eye only, one should work on one, and if in both then likewise;
and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and let the head of the patient be in your lap and put your index finger on the medicine, and press a little and move it every time the patient feels burning from the medicine, for they feel burning as if from fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger.
And when the stinging has passed, wash the area with water, and observe if you see the eyelid raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision;
and if it is so, it is good.
If not, put more of the medicine on the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyes are set right;
then put cotton soaked in butter until the burnt flesh falls off, afterwards treat the area with the ointment that is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you watch your work very carefully so that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the eyelid becomes soft afterwards, and the hair pricks the eye, restart the medicine on that place of the eyelid that has softened, just as you did before;
afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that men's eyes are different in size, both large and small, and according to this should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be hidden from one who studies this art.
on the cure of fistula by cautery
When you treat fistula as we have said in the division of diseases, and your treatments do not profit, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Command the patient to put his head in your lap;
and have the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor shake his head;
then put cotton soaked in egg white or in parsley juice on the eye;
then heat the cautery which is like this:
and is hollowed at the end like the form of a small bolt, together with which is the cautery;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a probe;
but nevertheless, this one that is hollowed works better for your operation.
After pressing the fistula if it is open, and drawing out the pus, and drying it;
and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the matter;
then put on the very hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery on the side of the nerve away from the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake;
and put the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you come to the beginning of the cautery until the bone, it will be good.
If not, restart the cautery once more, and another if you need it, and leave it for 3 days;
afterwards put on cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if 40 days pass and it is not healed, put on sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered;
and scrape it according to what will come in its chapter.
And there is a manner of cautery for fistula that some of the ancients spoke of.
Pay attention to the fistula, and split the place;
then put in the split a subtle camahan of which here is the form:
and make it to the quantity of one .З. of lead;
and hold your hand on the camahan firmly, and let not the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary to put on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have spoken of, that is good.
If not, it is necessary to administer holes to the nerve, and bring back the fistula to the body of the nerve according to what is necessary in its proper place.
About cracks in lips:
Very often cracks occur in lips that are called "hair," and especially in children's lips.
When you treat these cracks with what we have mentioned in divisions, and the treatment doesn't help, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly in these cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with wax until it is healed.
About abscess of the mouth:
When an abscess comes in the root of the mouth or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it creates pus and breaks and becomes old and turns into a fistula;
and you treat it as we have said in divisions, and it doesn't help:
then you need to have a cautery according to the size of the fistula;
after insert it in the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its bottom, and the furthest place;
and do this once or twice, after treat it with what we have mentioned in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed this way, that's good;
and if not, then it's necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
About loose teeth:
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth become loose, and you treat it with medicines and that doesn't work, then put the patient's head in your lap;
after heat the cautery whose form will come after in such a way that you put a tube over the tooth;
and put inside the hot cautery quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat coming to the root of the tooth;
after lift your hand and restart the cautery according to your will;
after let the patient fill their mouth with salted water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in such a way the tooth that was moving becomes firm, and the softened gum tightened, and the corrupted moisture dried.
About tooth pain:
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold indeed, and medical treatments don't work, then there is need for cautery in two ways:
both butter cautery and fire cautery.
Butter cautery is such that you take cow's butter, and boil it in an iron or brass spoon;
after take cotton and wrap it on the point of a probe, and dip it in boiled butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold until it cools;
and do this often until its power reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, dip wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or brass tube, and let it be thick so that the fire doesn't come to the patient's mouth;
after heat the cautery, whose form will come after, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And the patient should fill their mouth with good butter during the pressing of this cautery, and then spit it out;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make a cautery from whichever end you want, and according to what you are able;
and this is the form of the tube:
About scrofula
When scrofulas are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not responsive to treatment by medicines, then heat the hollow cautery of which the form comes hereafter, and it should have two openings for the vapors to exit from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for 3 days;
and place cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
The form of the reed:
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold constitution, then it is necessary that the patient first be purged by purgative medicines;
afterwards make a cautery at the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach all the way to the throat, and burn only a little of the flesh.
Afterwards make another cautery at the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let it be the cautery that is called "clavicle" of which we have the form before;
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
About cough
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the chest in empty places;
and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let it be the cautery that is called "clavicle" according to the form that is mentioned before.
And if you wish, make cautery by puncturing with the cautery that is called "points" of which the form is shown before in the treatment of ears;
and let the points be up to 30, or thereabouts.
Afterwards treat the area according to what was said before, and let the cautery be with 3 branches according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are easier, because you make 3 at once.
About dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and one puts it back in place, and it cannot stay but rather keeps coming out again with small movements that occur, as we have experienced, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Afterwards let the patient lie on his back and on his side;
afterwards lift the flesh that is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inward, then heat the cautery that has 2 branches of which here is the form:
and cauterize the flesh until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery will make 4 cauteries;
and for this reason cautery is made with the cautery that has 3 branches, whereby the figure of cauterization makes six cauteries;
and the branches are according to the thinness of a probe and this is the form of the cautery that has 3 branches:
And sometimes one branch is added to this whereby there are 8 cauteries.
Afterwards place on the cautery crushed leeks with salt;
afterwards let the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make cautery on the thickness with the clavicle cautery, or many puncturing cauteries.
For the joint is secured, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture come into the stomach, such that they draw it from its natural state, and catarrhs multiply in it, and the customary ways of treatment do not profit, then the patient must lie on his back, and extend his legs and hands.
After this, make three cauterizations: one below the breast bone at the distance of a finger, with the nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations outside the two sides so that the pattern of the cauterizations forms three angles, and leave such space between one and another that they do not join together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauterizations be so deep that they encompass two parts of the skin, and let the pattern of the cauterizations be according to this form without addition:
And if you want to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and for one who fears this cautery, cauterize by pricking and mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity that you want with ink;
then cauterize it with the cautery that is called "points."
After that, treat it with the treatment that we had before, until it is healed.
When pain comes to the liver from cold and moisture and thick windiness, such that it is thrown out of its natural state by superfluities;
and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not profit him, then the patient must lie on his back;
and mark with ink three cauterizations according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, there where man's elbow comes;
and let there be space between each cautery the thickness of a finger;
and let the cauterizations be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much with the cautery;
and let only half the skin be burned, and let the patient stand on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
and this is the form:
And if it is your will, cauterize these cauterizations with the knife-shaped cautery, if you are subtle and wise in the art, and guard yourself that you do not burn all the skin, for you would dry out the whole body;
and that it does not come to the bowel, for the skin is very thin there, and know this for true.
When there is an aposteme in the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane:
if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain but not too strong;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels mad pain.
And when this treatment deceives the physicians, then the patient must lie on his back;
and then mark with ink the place where the aposteme is, and then heat the cautery that resembles a ray, of which here is the form:
And cauterize one cautery until the skin is burned, and comes to the peritoneum, so that all the pus comes out;
after that, treat according to the treatment of exits until he is healed;
and it is not fitting that anyone use this cautery except one who has studied long in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have sometimes run.
Then he can work boldly, and nevertheless it seems to me that leaving it is better.
Of the cautery for pleurisy
The ancients said that one should make cauteries for pleurisy from aristolochia roots, and in this manner:
take a root of long aristolochia, the largest that you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your finger;
and moisten it in oil, and light it with fire, and cauterize one cautery between the collar bone and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower in the part that is below the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, declining a bit backward;
and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another on the stomach, and one between the shoulders, and two on the two sides of the chest outside the cautery that is between the shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly as if smelling.
