CHAPTER SIXTEEN.	Chapter XVI.	0.6767231
Ungula occurs in two forms: either the nervous, which resembles a fine hard membrane; or the non-nervous, like a white congealed humidity; which, when the iron touches it or you try to pick it up with a hook, is cut through and the hook has no hold on it.	You should know that the ungula (growth) presents in two forms. Either it is fibrous, resembling hard, thin tissue. Or it is non-fibrous, similar to a white, frozen moisture, which, when touched with an instrument or hook, breaks off and does not hold the hook.	0.82789695
Both kinds grow from the greater angle of the eye, whence they spread little by little until they cover the pupil and block both the vision and the movements of the eye.	Both types typically begin at the larger tear duct and gradually extend until they cover the vision, blocking light and eye movement.	0.84181494
This is the method of incision: the patient places his head in your lap and opens his eyes; then you raise the lid with your hand; then with a gently curved hook pick up the ungula and pull it upward; then take a needle threaded with a horse hair or an ox hair, and a strong thread; slightly curve the end of the needle; then thrust it into the middle of the ungula, piercing it with the needle; and tie the ungula with the thread and pull upwards; and, with the hair, peel the side of the ungula adjoining the pupil, and divide it with a sawing motion right through.	The procedure for incising it is to have the patient rest their head on your lap. Then, open their eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand. Next, grasp the growth with a hook that has a slight curve, and lift it upwards. Then take a needle, and insert a strong thread made of horsehair, ox, or cow hair. Bend the tip of the needle slightly, then embed it in the center of the ungula. Push the needle through the ungula, then secure the thread around it and stretch it upwards. Use the thread to scrape along the side of the ungula nearest to the pupil, as though you were sawing it with the thread until reaching its end.	0.90872264
Then what is left in the root of the angle cut out with a fine scalpel, or with small scissors; and leave the natural caruncle in the canthus lest, in cutting it away, a chronic flux of tears occur.	Next, cut away the remainder near the tear duct’s root using a fine spatula or small scissors, preserving the natural flesh around the tear duct to prevent a continuous flow of tears.	0.6995849
The ungula may be drawn out with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, and scraped away with the smoothtipped scalpel of this form.	Sometimes the ungula can be extended with only the hook or the thread, as previously described. Then, scrape it off gently with a soft spatula, shaped as described.	0.7601216
But beware lest the scalpel touch the corneal covering and cause a fissure in it and the pupil protrude.	Be careful not to let the spatula touch the corneal layer, as it could rupture and puncture the pupil.	0.81069386
Then after the incision put into the eye a little powdered salt or an eye-lotion of verdigris, and leave it till the following day; then treat as may be necessary till it heals.	After the incision, apply crushed salt or a solution made from ziniar (possibly a type of mineral or medicinal compound) to the eye, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals.	0.7722844
If the ungula is non-nervous in origin and you cannot transfix it with a needle nor get a hook to hold fast in it, this sort is often successfully treated by medical means. So treat as described in the section.	If the ungula is non-fibrous and neither the needle nor the hook can hold onto it, this type is often treated with medicines and heals as described previously.	0.83236516
But if you prefer to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a fine smooth scalpel, rather blunt, like this and with this gently scrape away the ungula from above; and if you see that it is crumbling away and breaking down under the scraping, then immediately instil into the eye some eye-lotion of verdigris, or the red eye-lotion, or a little powdered salt, and bind the eye up till next day.	If you wish to cut it, open the patient’s eye and take a fine, smooth spatula with a slight edge, shaped as indicated. Gently shave off the ungula from the top with precise scraping. If you observe that the ungula is thinning and fragmenting, and the scraping is effective, then apply a few drops of your solution made from ziniar or red sief, or crushed salt, and cover the eye until the next day.	0.86047155
Then repeat the operation on it till you have removed it all, unless an abscess forms in the eye, in which case cease the operation and treat the abscess till cured.	Then repeat the procedure on it until the entire ungula is removed. Unless you are faced with a warm abscess in the eye; in that case, leave the ungula alone and treat the abscess until it heals.	0.85990727
Then repeat the treatment with the same scraping till healed.	Then repeat the procedure with the scraping until it heals.	0.8967948
As for a protuberance of flesh in the angle, if it causes great hurt pick it up with a hook and cut part of it away, with not too big an incision lest there be a flux of tears.	If the fleshy prominence near the tear duct causes significant discomfort in the eye, lift it with a hook and cut away a portion of it, but avoid excessive cutting to prevent continuous tearing.	0.7501956
Then into the canthus instil red eye-lotion or lotion of verdigris till healed.	Then apply red sief or a ziniar-based solution to the tear duct until it heals.	0.79058725
