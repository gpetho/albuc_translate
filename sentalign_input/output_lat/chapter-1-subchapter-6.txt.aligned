The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.	The tortura treated with cauterization is only one of the conditions that arise from phlegm, as we said in the divisions of ailments.	0.7449987
But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	And avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.	0.6636627
When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.	When you treat this type of tortura with syrups, head purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the patient in three places: one at the root of the ear, the second a little lower near the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.	0.81681925
Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.	And place your cautery on the side opposite the weakened area. For the relaxation does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.	0.717914
The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin.	And the procedure for cauterization is to cauterize him with the cautery directly below the upper end of the ear near the horn of the head a little; and another at the temple, the length of which is the length of a thumb. And place your hand down with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.	0.83092374
The shape of the cautery. It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see. Its blade should have a certain thickness.	And this is the form of the cautery, which is a type of knife, whose shape was previously shown; however, it is a bit less delicate, as you see, and it should be slightly thicker than necessary.	0.76526916
Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.	Then treat the locations with the same treatment as before until they heal.	0.66981137
