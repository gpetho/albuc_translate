On Cauterizing Chronic Tears.	On cauterization of persistent lachrymation.	0.7431266
If the tears of the eye are chronic and continuous, and are from the veins and arteries that are on the surface of the head, outside the skull, and you are certain that it is from an excess of cold, thick, phlegmatic humors, then cauterize it with the same cautery that I described at the beginning of the falling water section. One cauterization in the middle of the head, two cauterizations on the temples, and two cauterizations on the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need to increase it, cauterize one on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.	When tears are constantly in the eye and arise on account of the arteries and veins visible on the outside of the head, and you are sure that they are from cold thick phlegmatic superfluities, burn him with the very cautery that I taught for the beginning of cataract, namely, a cauterization in the middle of the head and two on the temples, and two on the back of the neck below the two bones; and, if you are compelled to add more, one cauterization on the side of the outer corner of each eye at the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.	0.91117036
