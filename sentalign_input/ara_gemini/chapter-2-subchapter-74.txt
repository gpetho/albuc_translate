Chapter seventy-four on slow ripening of the abscess that occurs in the uterus
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, petrified tumors, ulcers, abscesses, corroding sores, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors, and all these diseases, their types, and their signs have been mentioned in the classification, so it is appropriate that we mention in this article the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors that collect matter, how its opening with iron instruments should be.
It is appropriate that you examine it, and if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is acute, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever, and you see it red when touched, then do not rush to open it, and treat it with what helps it to ripen until these symptoms subside, and at that time, it is appropriate that the woman sit on a chair with two seats, and lean on her back, and gather her legs towards the lower abdomen, and her thighs be spread apart, and put her arms under her knees and tie them with a suitable bandage, then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the picture of which will come later.
It is appropriate, if you want to use this instrument, that you estimate the depth of the woman's uterus with a probe, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus and harm the patient, and if the instrument is longer than the depth, it is appropriate that supports be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is appropriate that the screw that runs in the instrument be on the upper side while you hold the instrument and the servant turns the screw until the cervix opens.
And when the abscess appears and is touched by hand, and it is soft and thin, it is appropriate to incise it at its head with a wide scalpel, and when all the matter is discharged, it is appropriate to put in the wound a soft wick dipped in rose oil or green oil with some astringent, and the wick should come out of the incision in the cervix, and pure wool dipped in water in which marshmallow has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and on the pubis, then treat after two days with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
The uterus and the wound may also be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long birthwort has been boiled, then return to the ointment.
If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus, it is appropriate to refrain from treating it with iron, rather it should be treated with what we mentioned in the classification.
