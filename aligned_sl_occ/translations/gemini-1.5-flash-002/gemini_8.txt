O, my sons, since I have completed for you this book, which is the culmination of the science of medicine, and by its completion I have achieved the goal, and through its expositions and its explanations, it seems to me that I must fulfill this to you with this treatise, which is a part of manual operation, that is, surgery.
Because manual operation is neglected in our region and in our time, almost entirely lost, so that the science of it is greatly diminished, and its practice is abandoned; and nothing remains of it but some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly corrupted and fallen into errors and uncertainty, so that their intentions are obscured and their power and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise, according to the method of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and that it should come with the forms of the cautery instruments and of the other instruments of the work, both by way of explanation and by preparation of them, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled craftsman with his hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, which is lacking in Gaul, so that he knows the positions of the limbs and their shapes, and their connections and separations; and he must have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number and arrangement; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that in name it is much, but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy, is not exempt from falling into error by which men will be killed, as I have seen many of them, because some are trained in this science and practice it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish and unskilled physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut some arteries of the neck so that a great quantity of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who had it since his youth, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and a black, crippled man came to him who had a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance,  extracted the fracture, over the wound, with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound to breathe (i.e., did not allow for proper air circulation).
And then he loosened it according to his desires, and then he bound it, and then he left it for several days and commanded that we not loosen the binding; and it remained thus until the thigh and foot became suppurated, and it came to ruin (i.e., resulted in loss of the limb or even death).
And I was called to him, and I prepared to untie the binding, and tranquility was achieved and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for several days, until the malignancy of it was magnified with its lord (i.e., until the infection spread extensively).
The reason is that because a hot cancer is pure melancholic humor, then it is not fitting that it be approached with iron at all, but it should be in a limb that is sacrificed (i.e.,  amputated) to prevent its spread.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two parts: that is, in an operation to which health is associated, and in a work with which there is peril in the greatest dispositions (i.e.,  operations with high risk).
And I have already explained this in every part of this book where operations occur which involve error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to observe this and leave that, so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method by the grace of God, leading to health and laudable success, and avoid terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and abstain from those things that make you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not overcome you: for this is more lasting to your glory, and more highly regarded in the world and later among your sanctities.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician".
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter is ordered from head to foot, on the forms of instruments and the tools of cauterization, and on what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of suction and perforation, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and dislocation, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I describe the qualities of the benefits of this cautery and its harms, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed on it, and a small part of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, whether with matter or without matter, except for two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to it, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable for a disease which is caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry disease should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I refute those who say the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry disease that comes to the bodies of men, for when you compare the human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I say, regarding this discourse, that experience has revealed this to me on several occasions.
However, it is not appropriate that this should apply to someone who has already been tried and exercised in the chapter on cautery through previous practice, and who has known the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the duration of those.
But in other complexions, there is no fear for you, especially in cold and moist diseases, for all physicians have agreed on these, and they are not in disagreement regarding the benefit of cautery in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire and its goodness, over cautery with burning medicine, is because fire is simple, the action of which does not reach except the member which is cauterized and does not harm the other members joined to it except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches even those members which are distant from it, and quickly brings to the member a disease of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except that it supersedes. And it is already known to us by experiment and by long service of study with the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this I am excused from the length of the speech. And if it were not that it is not written in my book in this place, I would reveal to you a secret concerning fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and its expulsion by which it expels illnesses, with a philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be sharp in your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, placing springtime as the best time.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by the accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is achieved with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for necessary pains or strong and urgent pains, which do not permit delay because it is feared that harm may come from those who are slow to act,  a harm greater than the small harm incurred by acting at any time.
And this does not occur to you, O sons, this is only estimated by the vulgar people and foolish physicians, that to that illness which is healed by cautery there is no remission at all times, and they posit that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they think, for cautery is nothing other than a medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, superfluous cautery is performed over and above other medicine because of the speed of its effectiveness and the power of its action and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that his illness will return at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness, and his strength, and that which is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in him, and that which has reached him through his acquisition of food and similar causes; but if the illness to which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a limb with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar things, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this is done only in small cases.
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and this is a true saying, not in the sense that they understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that benefits with medicine or with any other means besides cautery.
And the reason is the opposite of that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer methods of cure in certain illnesses, and those medicines do not work, and then at the end, one administers cautery, and it benefits in that case. And therefore, from here it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and most foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the purity of gold and the nobility of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not scar, although this is not entirely true, for I have already proven this and have found that it does not do this except in some bodies and not others, and cautery with this is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you do cautery with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is ignited according to the quantity you want, due to the hardness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply too much heat, the gold melts in the fire, and some sheets fall into the fire so that the artisan is distracted by that.
And therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more readily with accuracy of operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that I may easily give the inquirer what he seeks.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is applied to dampness and coldness affecting the brain; the accidents of which are two causes: that is, the cause of excessive and copious rheumy flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and much sleep, and toothache, and throat pain, and universally of every illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, lethargy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine, purifying the head, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habit.
And then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit between your hands on a low bench and place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm against the space above the root of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that spot, mark that place with a probe, and then ignite the olive cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with the probe, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand should be gradually tightened, and you should rotate it.
And then lift your hand slightly and observe the place, and if you see some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, like the quantity of a grain of barley, then lift your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another like it, if it is cold, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the place and leave it for three days.
And then place on it lint soaked in wine, and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. And then treat the place with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And it is said that when the wound remains open, it better discharges the arm, because it is better and more helpful.
And some of them say that the elbow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's substance is charred.
And then scrape away what is burnt from the bone, and then it should be treated.
And others say that with the cautery, reach the back, until it penetrates strongly into the bone, until the bone is burnt, and this is the method for a small ulcer: And they believe that vapors from the head are expelled from that place.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be healed until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a way of fear; and leave that, it seems to me, better is health when it is; for the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity as we have testified in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a fragile nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and I use and work with that one for health.
Chapter Two.
Of cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs throughout the head in a patient, and he uses leeches and cupping and purgatives and plasters and poultices and cauterizations and ointments and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we have recounted and none of those things benefit him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not fragile and finds much great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery a little below that one. And then cauterize that [area] on the temple of his head with a cautery until the scab is formed. Incise the scab and let the bone be uncovered to the extent we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the back part of the head in the place which is called the vas – and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient thereby finds much great pain, different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I would say this cautery in its place, for it is necessary that the cautery with which the temples of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter three.
On the cauterization of recent migraine.
When a sharp pain arises in the head, or a spreading pain within the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the sections on illnesses; and if nothing benefits, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it, and bind its extremities on both ends. Then incise the place of the pain in the temple with a lancet, until a place is made under the skin, until it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress for a constant constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then unbind it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a cotton ball soaked in butter until the area becomes soft.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner:  heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail or peg, because its head is shaped like a clove, in which there is a certain curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the flesh below is not burned — and rotate the iron little by little, with speed.
And if the quantity of flesh burned by the heat of the cautery is about half of it, lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; and then place cotton soaked in oil, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a knife, as with a cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular, not-ancient, type of headache.
Chapter four.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic headache.
When you treat a headache with what we have said in the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes because of the illness, what we said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is insufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the knife cautery until it is white-hot, after which you mark on the painful area with a line whose length is half a finger, or thereabouts; and pause your hand for a moment and press it until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be wary of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle not be injured and the nerve which moves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the guarding and caution against the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, because in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who ignores what he is doing and is not studious and experienced; and leaves the operation in him at the beginning.
And I will come with a reminder of the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if sometimes this illness is not relieved by this cauterization and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of the artery with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Of the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxatives and with the other treatments which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is called a puncture, of which this is the form:
And then puncture, then ignite, and let it be moved around the whole ear as a wheel is revolved, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is in a specific part. Lengthen the cautery from the root of the ear little by little, after you have marked the spot with a probe.
And if the cautery makes ten punctures in the whole ear, or whichever one it is, then afterwards treat the places until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only one of the types that comes from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type that originates from dryness or from a spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of cough with bleeding, purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side from the affected part, because softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the ear, a little above the corner of the head, and another in the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the little finger, and hold your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of a finger's breadth is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of small knife, the form of which is shown before. However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away some of the superfluous thickness.
And then take care of the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment is ineffective, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the nape of the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is also cauterized above the stomach; and it is better afterwards; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
On cauterization for forgetfulness done by flame.
So that at the beginning large potions and purgative pills are given to the patient.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and apply to their neck a plaster of cetre described in the treatise of plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cautery. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And therefore if he is healed by those means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauteries in the back part of his head, which descend from the uppermost part of the head down to the lowermost part of the neck. And place between each cautery the width of a finger, and then treat the cautery with what has been prescribed.
But if you add more and the patient tolerates it, then apply a cautery in the middle place; and if you want greater addition, then cauterize that over the two horns (possibly referring to areas of the head).
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
So that you proceed in the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns (possibly referring to the temples) of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find it and the patient tolerates it and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries over the spinal vertebrae, and finally with a cautery until it is burned from the tailbone up, and raise your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be an olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and can tolerate the removal of humors.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and cauterize on each temple of his head. And if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as was previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small/fine cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and gross phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries which we have mentioned in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess [of humors] tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has been explained previously in the [earlier] section.
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a properly-made [medicinal] plaster for him, and then place that in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright and held securely on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is most worthy [or effective] to use old sheep's fat. And warm that [liniment] over the fire with moderate heat, which the said [patient] will suffer when it is applied to him. Then pour that [liniment] into the middle of his head within the circle, and leave it there until it is cold.
And do this to the patient once a week, with his other good regimen, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that [area] making small punctures according to the need, but hold your hand with a cautery so arranged: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in butter or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of water descending into the ear.
When the onset of water in the ear is revealed to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient a drink that will purify his head, and keep him from all humidity.
And make him sweat in a bath of some kind for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the onset of the water is in both ears, or on one side if the onset of the water is in one ear.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the nape of the neck; and let the cauteries be lengthwise in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with any medicine which is possible for you.
And I come with the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed lengthwise.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (likely referring to long-standing wounds or sores).
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest location of the head outside, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the beginning chapter about water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it needs additional treatment, then cauterize it in all the space of the corner of the eye above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or, more likely, a foul smell from the nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not work, then you prepare and give the patient decoctions to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauteries above the two eyebrows, just below the hair.
And be careful with the cautery that you do not burn it (the skin/area).
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form (or shape).
Chapter 15.
Concerning the cauterization for the softening (or mollification) of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize, do so above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part, and let them be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too much with the cautery, but only so that a third part of the eyelid is hardened/cauterized.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward toward the eye and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eyelid are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either done with fire or with a burning medicine.
If cauterizing with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave their eyelashes as one shaves them, until they are lengthened and thinned; and if it pricks near their root, then bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not harmed until the hairs have grown back.
Then, when they have grown back and thinned, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid with a probe, with a mark that is shaped like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then apply a pledget soaked in egg white or in mallow mucilage to the eye.
And then ignite the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the figure you have marked, little by little, in several times, until the surface of the cornea, which is like a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and its hairs raised above the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then apply a pledget with a poultice until the scar is healed. And then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the hairs near their roots and the eyelid is softened, then perform the cautery again on that, just as you did initially.
But if the hairs are below the eyelid, then cauterize that until it is raised to its natural place and is even, and the hairs do not touch the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; this is that you instruct the patient to pull out the hairs until they are long and even, and then a leaf-shaped compress of cloth is made.
Then take known soap and quicklime and oil, or whatever that is, and then mix those ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; and then spread this on the cloth which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place that over one eye or both; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it a little and do not move it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire.
And then, when you perceive that he feels the bite, then leave the medicine and wipe it with your finger; then, when the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider if you see that the eyelid is already raised; if it is not raised, constrict it with fire or with incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet been applied and it does not become dark until your work is even and the eye is contracted.
Then place cotton with a bandage over it until the scab from the cauterization is removed, and then treat it with healing ointment or with something else until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to watch with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid in a few days is softened and some hair is sticking in the eye, then repeat your medicine on that part of the eyelid which is softened, and exactly as you did at the beginning, and then bandage it until it is healed.
And this is the form/preparation using myrtle leaves.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size (magnitude and smallness), and therefore your constriction [of the eyelid] is done accordingly.
And the path to perfect skill will not be hidden from one who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and have a minister hold their head between your hands in such a way that their head is not moved or shaken.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or gum arabic on their eye.
And then heat the cautery, whose form is as follows:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you wish, let it be pointed like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
Then place the cautery, which should be well ignited, on it, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not burn or the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the granulated area of the eye and burn it away.
And so if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then place a bandage over it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed and is scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some ancients described:  Attend to the location of the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin tube, which is its shape: And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand with the tube with good retention, and do not hurt the patient so that the molten lead does not reach the eye; and you must place on the patient's eye a cloth soaked in egg white or water, because the lead will adhere to the fistula location and heal it with a marvelous cure.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a puncture of the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Of the cauterization of the fissure of the wells (likely referring to abscesses or sores).
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the previous sections and your treatment is not effective, then ignite a small, knife-like cautery according to this form which is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that iron in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then treat it with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops, then breaks, becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula forms, and you treat it but the treatment is ineffective, then you should apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula. Then place this heated cautery into the fistula opening, holding it with your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom, and do this once or twice while afterwards applying what we have previously described for the treatment until it heals.
And thus, if the wound is healed and healthy, good; but if not, then it is necessary to open the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be explained in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines without success, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be described below, so that you place the small cup over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, holding your hand briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reach the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as needed.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is fixed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humidity is dried out.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in it, and you cannot effect a cure with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with a cow's bladder, or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with a bladder involves taking a cow's bladder and boiling it in a pot of iron. Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a stick, and then dip it in the boiled bladder, and quickly apply it to the painful tooth until it cools.
And then repeat this several times until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in the aforementioned bladder, and place that on the aching tooth, and place ignited iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is done by heating a small tube of bronze or iron, ensuring that there is some thickness at its core, so the intensity of the heat doesn't reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired temperature, and place it on the tooth, holding your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times, for the pain will be lessened either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, during the application of this cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good wine and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of cauterization.
And cauterize with whatever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophuli (likely referring to a type of skin eruption or lesion).
When extrophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to medicinal digestion, and you wish to digest them gently, then you ignite the cautery, the shape of which is as follows (description of shape to follow, implied by the text). It has two open ends so that the smoke escapes from one end of the cautery, and place that ignited instrument upon that abscess once, or more times if needed, until it reaches the core of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply a cloth soaked in boiled water over it until that which the fire has burned is softened.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On cauterization of hoarseness and constriction of the throat.
When humors accumulate in the lung canal, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then the patient should be evacuated initially with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that area below the root of the throat in the constricted place.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn the windpipe, but only a little.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the junction of the neck at the back of his last vertebra. And his cauterization should be done with a nail, following the previous manner.
And then treat it with what has been prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humidity, and the patient has no fever or consumption (tuberculosis) and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries on the clavicle in the depressed areas near the shoulders and armpits; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the preceding method.
And if you wish, your cauterization may be done with the cautery called a punctum, the form of which precedes in the puncturing for earache.
And let the points be close to those; and then treat it with the same remedies that precede until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with this: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the penis.
When the head of the penis is dislocated due to lubricous humors and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation until it is accustomed to returning, and then by a small movement it is dislocated again, as we have testified, then first you must reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned onto his back or side; and then raise the skin which is on the inside of the penis to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated on the inside.
And then heat the cautery which has two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side; and the cauterization will then be in the form of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place over the cautery cooked porridge with salt, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors come into the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying in it, and if you continue the methods of treatment and do not cure it, then the patient should lie on his back, extend his arms and legs, and then cauterize it with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of the cautery, so that a triangular figure of cauterization is created; and space them so they are not touching, to prevent putrefaction.
And if the depth of the cautery is two-thirds the thickness of the finger.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery according to the form of a circle according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized, puncturing it where the cautery is feared: and it is that you mark on the stomach points according to the quantity you wish with a probe, and then cauterize those points with a cautery; and then cure it with the previously mentioned treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, or humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is expelled from its normal composition by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it does not help, then the patient should be supine on his back, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same quantity on the liver under the hypochondria, where the decubitus of a man is perceived.
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight finger.
And do not press too much with the cautery.
And if the quantity of what is burned is half the thickness of a goose quill, then no more should be added; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having already extended his legs, and raising his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and that the thickness of a whole goose quill be burned, lest the whole body be burned and it reach the intestines, for the quill here is thin; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When there develops a wound or abscess in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds gravity and pain without acuteness.
And if it is in the membrane of the liver, the pain is very acute, and sometimes it fatigues the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be positioned on his side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then ignite the cautery, which is shaped like a rake, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire swelling is burned, until it reaches the pus, until blood comes out.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this form of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many illnesses have been treated;  but let someone with some experience sometimes dare this operation, but otherwise leave it to us, and it is better so.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy, according to this manner, is effective, and this is how you do it: you take of the long, dried roots of birthwort a root as long as a finger, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in the place which is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries under the chin, slightly inclined towards the part below the beard, and with two cauteries in the area that is declining between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclining slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another on the stomach, and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in the place which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you grasp your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be held in the evident manner by an assistant.
And some ancients said that some men used a cautery of iron resembling a ray and ignited it, and placed it in the area between the ribs, until it reached the abscess and was safely removed, just as we have said in the case of the abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with a cautery is not without danger, because you might quickly kill the patient, creating a fistula which is incurable.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said of the treatment in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct. One is to make three or four cauteries along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauteries, the form of which has been previously described.
And between each cautery should be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we described for the liver cautery.
And do not compress with your hand over the cautery; and the patient should lie on their side.
And another way of cauterizing is to ignite the cautery with two points, the reason for which we have mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the rib which is in the area of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And your elevation, with which you raise the rib, should be along the length of the body, so that cauteries are made along the width of the body.
Then insert the two ignited points quickly into the space so that with them you penetrate the rib from the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
Then you must care for the cautery until it has stopped discharging pus for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding things in the cure.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical person.
Cauterization is not used for dropsy, but only for certain specific cases.  (The "3" after "alcinte" is likely a scribal error or annotation and doesn't affect the core meaning.)
When you treat a dropsical person with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize them with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cauterization above the stomach, and with another cauterization above the liver, and with another cauterization above the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cauterization on the right foot, and with another cauterization above the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
And then leave the cauterized wounds open so that they drain for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization with what is necessary, so that two intentions are added to him, and he will be hastened towards healing with assistance. (This implies that the healing process requires sustained care and multiple approaches beyond the cauterization itself.)
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its form is described above.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the top of the foot, between the little toe and the ring finger.  Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand again, and do not completely withdraw it, for the yellowish water will drain.
The cautery is according to this form: Then make two cauteries on the two thighs, and on each thigh a cautery should be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water may drain from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is cold and damp, weakening its functions – that is, the digestive and retentive functions which are in the stomach and intestines – and this is treated with methods of cure and does not improve, and sometimes the patient suffers, exhibiting a need for cauterization, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the stomach as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and four small cauteries in a circle around the navel, with a small nail-like cautery; and with a cautery on the flank above the hip, either one large or two smaller cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it over the pubic area and over the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries over the stomach and near the inguinal regions, for it is a perfect cure, a help from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When there are chronic hemorrhoids in the lower nature, or those of thick cold humors or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not improve, then cauterize with three cauteries on the lowest part of the spine, small and slightly triangular, and with a cautery above the navel, slightly to the left of the two aforementioned.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery over the liver, and with another cautery over his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of swellings near their excision.
When you excise a swelling, then you immediately apply a cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert that burning cautery into the excised swelling, and lastly use your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the swellings are many, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat those with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is slower in being helpful.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. Of the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the private parts.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recounted in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the private parts, and it is old, running with pus and corrupted humidity, and then what is most worthy that is needed is that you probe it with a thin probe, and then know the quantity of its depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray. (Meaning a cautery iron shaped like a ray/fish). And then place that heated cautery into this fistula, according to the extent to which the probe entered.
And repeat the cautery on that until those corrupted bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to the amount of your necessity.
And beware of burning the nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think it is not penetrating.
And then treat the place until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and the materials have been excised from it, and remain so for a long time, then know that it is already completely cured.
And if the materials have not been removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or the bone underneath is corrupted, or this comes from those causes of which mention will be made in their place.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the cauterization of ulcers.
When in ulcers pain arises from cold or from excessive swelling, and because of this the patient's flesh is diminished, then it is necessary that you cauterize that over the ulcers with a cautery, over each ulcer with a nail-shaped cautery, of which mention was previously made.
And quickly cauterize again a little lower, so that three linear cauterizations result, and thus they will be more helpful in healing.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the walnut; and cauterize that with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped instrument, as is appropriate/customary.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the breast.
When cold and humidity come to the breast, and because of this conception is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauteries in the circuit of the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the place below the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and the sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it protrudes.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the area as it is swollen, so that the affected part falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind described previously in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be done according to the quantity and thickness of the whole spine; and then cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is cured with what we have said and don't hesitate, and this is ancient practice; then you must purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial pills, or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Now, according to two known methods, one of which is that you cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the place, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, so that it is a continuous circle and burns the thickness of the entire hip.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is adherent to the hip and is not extended to the thigh.
But if it is extended to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place to which the patient points as the location of the pain; and with one cautery on the hip, four fingers slightly below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-like, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the hip.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is extended to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates the pain to be below the buttock towards the hip, then cauterize there with a knife-like cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations that you do not go so deep with the cautery as to burn nerves or large arteries, lest this cause the patient harm, numbness or contraction.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle, and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg swelled until the tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong diarrhea occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places simultaneously, cauterize each according to this manner.
And the wise men say concerning the cauterization of the ankle, that the cautery should be like a circle of iron whose circumference is half a palm; and its opening should be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a hazel nut; and let those circles be open in two parts; and let the length of those irons be a hazelnut or two, and make in those irons a mark decently prepared in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the ankle, the patient lying on their side. Therefore cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave it for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says: O, son, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the fear of looking at it, and because we have found few who will look at it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with that its place.  (This could be improved with more context.  A better translation might be: "But among the good cauteries is one for him who suffers [them], and finds with this its [the ailment's] location.")
But cauterization with burning medicines is that you make two circles having perforated handles in which to place the bolt of the iron door; let the length of the walls in the height of them be two nuts or whatever those are. (This is a difficult sentence due to archaic language and possibly a few corrupt words. The meaning is unclear regarding the specifics of the instrument being described.)
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and let them be open below and above, and let them contain themselves between them according to this form: (This describes a surgical instrument or technique, but the specifics are hard to determine without a diagram or more context.)
Then place [the instrument] over the part of the hip, the patient lying on his side, and press your hand over the part of the hip; and then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the quality of that should be with a little fire little by little, and hold that for the quantity of an hour, and let the patient suffer the biting and burning of it—for that produces a burning as of fire—until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the entire hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and place a bandage over it until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for some days, and pus will drain from it; this is the final treatment.
Then cure that with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make for him a bath that contains water, according to how it was done for the hip equally.
And this is the method of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the preparation of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, an equal part of each, and crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom part of which is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that enters the ray (presumably a type of instrument or container).
And place under the bottom of the pot another inverted pot, and pour over that alkali and quicklime fresh water which covers them by a finger's breadth, and then when you compress them with your hand with good compression, and let the sharp water descend from the top to the inverted pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be a very strong caustic, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterizing other members, because it works like fire.
And some medicines with which it is also cauterized, such as verdigris and honey mixed with quicklime and soap, so that they are mixed together.
And Galien recounted from an ancient man the operation and cure by which pain in the hip and sciatic vein is cured, and he greatly magnified the excellence of it, and said that it had no need of another cure, and that it is healed once as he recounted, because he quickly entered the bath and is already healed of it.
And it is that some fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh is not found, fresh fig should be taken; and it should be pounded well with a little grease and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bound on.
And let it remain for the amount of three hours or for as long as the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that it is not fitting that anyone use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But already Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it profits him very well; and let the cautery be applied in this manner: let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and let it be placed between the toes of the foot and between the ankles.
Then take dried goat dung and burn it with fire until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of the burning reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called cautery of embers.  (or "cautery by embers")
Chapter 42.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth for various reasons, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and for similar reasons, by infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable for that one type which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, it is necessary, after evacuation of the patient with suitable pills and similar remedies, that cauterizations be made on the tooth where the pain is, three lines according to its width, provided that you mark with ink, on each line, five cauterizations or more, according to the amount that the patient's tolerance and constitution allow.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery, according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On cauterization at the beginning of gibbosity (or humpback).
Often this illness happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs in their spine with elevation and movement.
And you will find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in the whole part of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in a swelling that is caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call this properly gout.
And thus, if gout caused by cold [humors] is treated with a method of cure and the pains are not relieved, then cautery relieves them.
And it is so that you cauterize that [area] near the evacuation in the joint's circumference of the foot with many cauteries.
And let it be an olive-shaped cautery, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize [the area] and do not press too hard with the cautery, but only around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise to both knees, then administer the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called  *suagra* (likely a type of hand ailment), then puncture in the circumference of the knuckles, as if revolving, puncture in those two lines.
And if the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the circumference of the knuckles on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains reach the elbows or muscles in a few days, then cauterize each one from all parts of the joints.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a fracture occurs in the knees and the intestines protrude before the patella to the genitalia, and this is beginning to happen, then you should order the patient to cease eating that day and to use emollient remedies so that the rupture descends from his belly.
Then support the patient between your hands on his back, and command him to hold his breath until the patella or intestines are expelled or appear.
Then return that with your fingers and gently manipulate the rupture over the pubic bone, noting that its extremity should resemble a semicircle in the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and another servant should be at their legs, and another at their feet, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach the bone of the hip through the middle of the swelling; and repeat this another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And carefully observe the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest the patient suffer death or other great harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small, according to their size and measure.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a bandage until the burn scab has healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and wound are sealed/closed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not protrude outwards during the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be moderate in work, in the fullness of food and drink, and in vehement speech, for when he uses this regime of healing entirely, he will be healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen; and if, at the beginning, you want them to not protrude, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size.  Let what is excised from the hernia be about a third of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is appropriate.
And some earlier authors said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape, as it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a nail-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion.
When pain develops in some member due to a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cauterization of each member be according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is customary for these pains to be punctuated from one member to the one adjacent to it, so it is necessary to treat them with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes cauterized with great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, if you wish to cauterize it, consider if the leprosy is spreading and if it can be cured with what we have said in the division and it does not spread or persist; and if you fear that the corruption will affect the entire body and its constitution, then cauterize it on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second below it, towards the forehead at the hairline; and two above the ears, like horns; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, with the cautery, press your hand slightly so that it leaves a small impression on the bone, and the scabs are loosened, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is eased; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and manifestly apparent, then you should cauterize it with the cauteries we mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the elbow, and one on the elbow, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the buttocks and one on each buttock, and with two on the knees, and two on the muscles, and two on the ankles of his feet; and cauterize it on all the joints of the fingers of the hands and feet, and on each heel of his feet, and on the knuckles of his hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the heel, so as not to burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more precisely you apply the cauteries, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do from wounds, because his body is already numbed/stupefied.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the types/kinds of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the cauterization of stupor (or numbness).
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And afterwards, treat that with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes a numbness is cauterized which extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back, near the origin of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not presume upon this except one who is skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and in the origin of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.
When albaras is chronic and you apply no ointments of medicine to it, then you cauterize it with a cautery iron a little, according to the size of the affected area, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and with leaves of arnagrosa (rosemary?), and with pigeon's blood or with lamb's blood; each should be a part and all mixed together; then a cloth should be applied and placed on the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its circumference as it is swollen.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with the pointed cautery in the middle; but to me this is not advisable, because I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have seen this happen several times.
And it is more appropriate that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with several cauteries.
Chapter 50.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system.  Roman numerals were common in medieval texts.)
Concerning the cauterization of swellings/tumors.  (The word "adubilati" seems to refer to a type of swelling or tumor. The exact translation may depend on the specific medical context.)
When a swelling is slow to mature, and this is due to the excess causing it, or to the age of the patient, for he is old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of the time of year, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the swelling; then cauterize around its circumference with several small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the swelling until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that place which is lower down, so that the body of the arm may be relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of a corrosive [wound/ulcer].
A corrosive is a corruption moving in the limb, which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place that permits cauterization with fire, then you immediately cauterize with many small nails, or large ones, as is appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and no cause of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply crushed sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scabs are gone and all the corruption is eradicated.
And then treat it with flesh-generating ointments.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted areas.
And corrosion is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that serves in place of cautery. But however, cautery with fire is of greater benefit.
And I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the section, and therefore take that when you need it.
Chapter 53.
On the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times, a disease called a wound occurs in the parts under the foot, and it is a large, penetrating wound that injures the foot; and cautery in these cases is done in two ways, that is cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire is that you heat the concave cautery resembling a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size that encompasses the entire wound, and it should be of fine edges.
And then place that heated iron on the wound, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed pus. And then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it is not healed, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should apply cautery with water to those areas.  Take a cannula of bronze or iron or a vulture's quill, and place it over the wound; then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula, and hold your hand, and you should move it with compression of your hand all around, and press the edge of the cannula into the root of the wound, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the sore; and let the patient endure the sting of the hot water for a while, about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with those and then the others until you have treated all those that are in the body.
And then treat those, once the roots of the sores are eradicated, with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On the cauterization of tremor.
When someone suffers from tremor due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever of cold origin, or from a similar cause, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, using an olive-shaped cautery.
And their tremor will cease, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
On the cauterization of accidental blemishes on the body.
When blemishes appear on the body, and there are pustules and fissures caused by thick, corrupt matter; then, at the beginning, as they appear, it is necessary that it be cauterized over the head of the fistula with a fine cautery, with myrtle wood whose end is ignited with fire; or with a long root of elecampane; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes the cautery is also suitable at the beginning of their expulsion, according to this method; and they are not believed, and the superfluity is disrupted by making those, and heals from those. (This line is difficult to translate precisely due to the archaic language and possibly some corruption in the original text. The meaning seems to suggest that sometimes cauterization is used early in the process of removing excess fluids or matter, and that it disrupts the process of their formation, ultimately leading to healing).
However, it is necessary that this be done near evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of bleeding accidents caused by arrow wounds.
Often, there is bleeding from an arrow wound that is incised outside the wound, or from the incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and similarly, and it is difficult to stop.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then press with your hand on the orifice of the arrow wound, and place your finger on it, pressing it many times until the bleeding stops under your finger, and it does not come out.
Then put small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of these, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken,  applying it to that vein quickly once you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until the bleeding is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and withdraw the cautery, then take another cautery carefully from among those which are prepared in the fire, and do not cease doing this one after another until the bleeding is restrained.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that no other harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop it in those cases, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted, the extremities are best cauterized and the bleeding is stopped, or that it be tied with thread or a ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines whose virtue is to stop bleeding be applied to it; and they should be tightened with a cushion with decent constriction.
But that which administers decent restriction with ligature and stricture with cloths or by the application of cauterizing substances and the like, does not bring help except late.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently press with the index finger on the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply great pressure to it until the blood is stopped from the main part of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and over the artery, cold water of great coldness should be sprinkled until the blood is congealed and thickened; and then consider what need there is of cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their like.
We have already mentioned in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire is suitable and with burning medicine, and its occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the top of the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one seeking this will be relieved, then regarding what he will have requested.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is what is terrifying in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because it is necessary that there be great caution in it, for in the operation which is in this chapter, many times there is evacuation which is with blood with which life remains, through the opening of a vein or incision on an abscess or opening of a wound or purification of a wound or extraction of an arrow or incision of a stone and the like. And with all of these is accompanied fear and trembling, and in the hands of those who do them, death.
And I warn you that this, in which there is hesitation, should not fall upon you, for sometimes various kinds of men fall to you with many kinds of illnesses. And some of them are angry with their illness and death is light to them, and this is because of the vehemence of what they find in their illness, and because of the length of their illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And among them is one who gives you his wealth and says, you hoping for his health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to that which comes to you from which is this manner; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume anything about this except through certain knowledge which verifies this for you, and to which a praiseworthy outcome follows.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in this is to you help in acquiring fame and remembrance, praise and glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you His understanding and not withhold from you guidance and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that this which you ask for and of which you have need may be relieved for you.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children during childbirth and when the midwife squeezes the child's head without skill.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is unknown.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and all those whom I saw died, and thus it is to me a work abandoned in them. (Or: ...and thus this is seen by me to be a hopeless case in them)
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could not support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either collected between the skull and the bone, or it is collected under the bone on the brain.
Because the operation in that case, if the humidity is between the skull and the bone and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in width, and the length of the fissure should be about two finger-widths so that the humidity can run out, and this is the shape of the spatula:
And therefore if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:
And if the humidity is under the bone, the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head opened on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand on the inside parts and this is not hidden from you. It is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the humidity from the incision; and then tighten the fissures with cloths and lint; and then moisten it with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little humidity until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appears, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, and the patient dies from that blood flow with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Second.  (or Chapter 2)
When a catarrh or rheum occurs in the eyes or nose, and it is chronic, and the cure is not achieved with medicines, then the last resort is incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient should raise his head, and you should rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear; and the patient's neck should be constricted with a cloth; and observe where the vein pulses; and the location of each, near the ears, is compressed, and thus they are hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with a probe, and incise each one with a sharp lancet, making the incision reach the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and sever it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' breadth, for when a vein is incised, the blood flows out with a pulsatile flow, leaping out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth, and then mark it with a probe, and make the incision to the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let is about six ounces, and quickly let more or less, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any matter of the splinter remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
Then bind the wound with lint and linen bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrid humors and a certain quality in the tissues of the temples, or from an old, violent headache similar to these, and it is treated with medical methods of cure and this does not help, then we must attempt in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization, as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the temples; and attends to the artery apparent in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden only in few men by the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then let the neck of the patient be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the place with a rough cloth or evaporate the place with hot water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then put in an ointment and extract it to the superior parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the oncii [a surgical instrument], and then incise a part of it according to the quantity by which its ends are elongated and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, for if they are not incised, the blood will not flow at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords at length, and do not let putrefaction occur before the consolidation of the wound and the occurrence of blood flow.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of that same work.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or a hot complexion; for cautery is one of those things that helps drying humors, and therefore it is better in youth.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you fill the place with old linen, and that decent powders are placed on it, and then it should be cured with dry medicines that cause the flesh to grow and with bandages until it is healed.
And if, while you operate another time, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then you must take care to restrain that blood, either with cautery, or by filling the place with linen, and squeeze your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those things is at your disposal, then place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and apply water of extreme coldness to the area until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as necessary.
And what is easiest in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each one, very hot, until they reach the bone and incise the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two knives be equal. But however, if it has less sharpness than two knives, it is better, because if it is as sharp as two knives close to each other, it will not incise the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held in them and the flesh is cut lightly.
And this method is better in every respect and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter four.
Chapter Four: On the treatment of sharp and acidic tears from the eyes.
When there are acidic tears, and it is the flow from those veins which are on the head, and you find no cause for it in the medication, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and they feel in their forehead a crawling sensation as if it were ants crawling, and their eyes are swollen, moist, so that the hairs around them are wet, and the eyelids are inflamed by the sharpness of the tears, the ancients used various methods in the treatment of this condition, and they called this treatment "spassa".
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then incise three fissures in the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure reaches two fingers: one fissure should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal duct, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the amount of three fingers adjusted/joined together.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [spatula] the whole ridge which is between the two incisions, with the chisel which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [curette] against the flesh attached to the ridge, and its blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that appearance of the ridge, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old linen, and place on top of that powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the treatment of tears caused by cataracts and those descending into the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone experiences sharp and persistent cataracts, and sometimes the patient's eyes appear small and shrunken, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their hair falls out, and there is sharp, throbbing pain in the forehead and subsequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the cataracts and matter originate from many veins proceeding from the inner parts [of the head].
And the best cure in such cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision there in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be to the bone; and extend your hand from the temples' lacerations which are bruised because of chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then you must scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow there, and then treat it with a drying regimen which will cause the flesh to grow, thus: if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and make a plaster from them, and apply it to these wounds to encourage the growth of flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Every cause that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron or glass, or it is from a plant, such as a grain of wheat or a bean, or it is a flowing substance such as water or sour wine and things similar to them, or some animal.
And therefore, when a stone falls into the ear, or another cause similar to those things which do not soften or grow in the ear, and you expose the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then attempt its extraction, and cause sneezing with a potion, and block the nostrils before the onset of the sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards, for many times it is expelled with these methods.
And if it is not expelled, then attempt its extraction with the instrument called a fine surgical probe, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the probe, good; and if not, then attempt its extraction with a thin hook of little curvature.
And so, if it is not expelled by this, then make a copper cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the opening of the ear and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open but the cannula. And then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times it is done with what we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small amount of lit tinder or something similar prepared for catching birds, and place that on the end of a probe, and then carefully wrap a suitable cotton around that. And then insert that into the opening of the ear easily, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And so, if it is not expelled by all the means which we have recounted, then you should consider cutting it before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to the patient's strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear above the gray matter, in a well-prepared location. And let the incision be of a lunar shape until the stone is reached, and, the stone found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision immediately, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause falling into the ear is one of the growths that grows and is inflamed, then administer its treatment and extraction; but if it does not obey you in this way, then take finely powdered litharge according to this method: and administer with that the removal of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on small pieces of cloth, and then remove them with tweezers or with a fine instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thus relieved.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing at the beginning, and fill their ear with some old cotton, and lie down on the ear into which the water has entered; and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take some heated pebbles and lentils according to the length of the finger, and warm them a little in the fire, and the patient inserts one of these into the opening of their ear and jumps on one foot on that side and taps with another stone on the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or tow, and put one end into the ear and hold the other end to a fire until the middle of it is burnt.
Then put other tow there and do this as many times as necessary until all the water is expelled, and remove it with a cannula, as mentioned above for the stone extraction.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a fly or similar, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is large, which is apparent to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its cause is the easiest of all the other causes which fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your treatment is not effective, then you must expose the ear to the sun.
And then, if any cause of the worms appears, extract it with forceps or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula that is narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it strongly, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you should fill and close the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and wide above.
And so let it be such that it pushes what is in the cavity of the cannula to the place where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a reed and wrap its end decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the cavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines, into the cannula—and that is in the ear—and then insert the reed with cotton on it and press with your hand, with a moderate compression, until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should be slightly warmed by fire. And be careful that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cure of ear obstruction.
Sometimes children are born without perforated ears, and this also happens in some adults: obstruction in the ear canal due to an injury or fleshy growth within it.  This obstruction sometimes occurs in the front of the ear opening, which prevents hearing, and sometimes in the outer parts.
And that which occurs at the opening, preventing hearing, is among the most difficult to heal.
And in the case where hearing is possible, you should expose the patient's ear to the sun and examine it. And then, if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its end is narrow, with one side sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two fingers wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And then, if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or its meatus, then remove that with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the entrance of the ear, then take a thin probe and warm it slightly with fire, and carefully insert it into the ear canal.
And then, if you have felt an obstruction with which the patient experiences difficulty, due to the severity of hearing, ease its pressure gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a linen cloth, according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for a few days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some wool and dip it in rosewater, and powder it with finely ground [herb/substance], and use it; and if you see the ear is already suppurating, then you must remove the wool and replace it with other wool that you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the abscess has subsided; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which restricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which develops on the eyelids.
Styes which develop on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with an awl, and incise them with a spatula at their roots, and afterwards place a poultice on the affected areas.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a thin, lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains at their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there develops in the eyelids of the eyes a certain condition which resembles swelling in its strength and hardness, and because of this swelling it is called [a swelling/tumor].
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the eyelid, below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider then if the swelling proceeds in such a way that it appears from the eyelid and is spread to every part; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on that [swelling] lengthwise, and then peel it away from every part easily until it is removed, and then lift it with forceps and excise it.
And if the wound is large, then you close it with sutures; and care for it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it because its ointment restores it and causes it to heal.
And if the growth is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid beneath the inner surface, then lift the eyelid and lift the growth with forceps, even if you need to make an incision, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this harms nothing.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a growth on the eyelid above the eye.
A growth is a grey mass which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and mostly in children, it obscures their eyes and causes them much pain; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because of this, for tears flow from their eyes.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and the eyelids below their eyebrows are moist, which already shows swelling, and the appearance of a growth is imminent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the growth beneath.
And a certain method of operation is this: the patient rests their head on your lap, then you place a cloth between you and them, and make a circle of it according to the size which contains the growth from all sides, and then place that over it and press with your fingers so that the growth is gathered in the middle of the circle, and then make a cut in the middle of that swelling with a sharp instrument, the incision being of a width no greater than that made in bloodletting.
But in the incision it is necessary that you cut completely until you reach the growth, for in most cases the growth proceeds by fissure according to the form of a white grease.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the outer edges and roll it between your right and left hand until it is removed.
And be careful not to push into the incision so that with the instrument you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the growth does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then push a little gently into the incision until the growth appears; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar and place them on the area and bind them with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it draws out the remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
On the various ways of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes, pustules form under the natural hairs and are hardened, then these harm the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membrane, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called a disease of the eye. It is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery; or it is treated by incision and suture; or by canulas, as I shall describe.
Therefore, you should place the patient's head on your lap; then, turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into that part where there is pus under the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the pus upwards, and this should be—near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow—near the hairs, and pull the pus upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a ray. (The "ray" here likely refers to a tool or instrument, possibly a retractor).
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the hardened pustules with a sharp spatula from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct; and then extract the pus and place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then bind it over the eyelid with a bandage, and it should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies in people, for some require that a greater quantity of the eyelid be incised according to the extent to which the eyelid is softened.
Then, using the spatula, make an incision along the two lines that you have marked, beginning from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, let it be of the thickness of a king's [presumably a reference to a specific measurement or a thick needle/tool].
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the carbuncle, and then completely excise it, and then join the two lips with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and adhere any excess thread to the two eyebrows with some viscous substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then treat it [the wound].
And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its aggregation; but suture is better.  Therefore, the ancients advised this.
However, let there be diligence on the part of the surgeon, and it is a good operation, and there is no fear in it [for the surgeon].
And there is another way to treat [this], and that is to mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separated and collected hooks according to this form:
But if this is not possible, lacking the hooks—and this is not unusual—then take a needle on which there is thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers with equality, and then with those [threads], lifting your hand with equal elevation, raise the entire fold on which it [the myrtle leaf figure] is marked as we have described.
And then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then it is necessary that you use on that what we have said about incision; but suture in each case is more skillful [or "artificial"].
To cauterize with canes is according to this form: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and incise the growth that is inside as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two canes or two thin splinters whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of the space [i.e., the area to be cauterized]. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads [or sutures].
Then carefully add each [cane] with subtlety over what is superfluous of the eyelid skin, and bind the canes to each part with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days, for the growth, due to the ligature, will die and dry up and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Then, once it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of the two canes which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12.  Of the elevation of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle, and place on it a fine silk thread, and then adjust the ends carefully,  and knot them together in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm's length.
And then you prepare two other fine threads underneath it briefly, and tie their ends if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, which needs to be removed, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it from above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair upwards and insert it into the alixati (likely a type of tweezers or forceps), and let there be one or two or three hairs, and no more.
And then pull your hand with that until the hair is extracted with the alixolati (forceps) from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if it is pulled with the alixalati and the hair is not removed, you will pull the alixalati downwards with the thread which you have prepared with it, until the alixalati is removed from the upper wound.
And examine it with the vision of the eye, for then you will remove the alixati and the thread, and clean each one and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is raised with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened in some space, and then you raise it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of ehacratir which appears on the upper eyelid.
When ehacratir appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called harelip, and this ehacrati is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of a wound or incision or cautery, or by similar poorly healed conditions.
The manner of the operation is that you should incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not fitting that you use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do this, the ehacratir will return worse than it ever was before.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice with the water in which mallow and linseed have been boiled, or diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil, and dip the linen cloth in it, and treat with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should prevent, by every means, consolidation from occurring in a way different from its original form.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a rectification of the ehalixacrati (likely a misspelling or archaic term, possibly referring to a wound or injury) so that it returns to its former shape.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the treatment of an ehacrati (likely a misspelling or archaic term, possibly referring to a wound or injury) that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This injury (alxacrati, likely a misspelling or archaic term for a wound or lesion) which occurs in the lower eyelid, which is truly called an alxacrati, is sometimes natural, other times accidental.
But accidental ones are caused by a blow, or by a cut, or by a cautery, or by other similar things.
And the method of its operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh (of the eyelid).
Then stretch the flesh of the eyelids together with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula (or possibly a broad, flat instrument). And then if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, it is good; and if not, take a splint and place it in the split area, and with it, reshape the eyelid, and close the two fissures in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures (incisions) be two angles of the incision which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be formed by them so that when they come together a figure is formed from them.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda (Λ).
Then remove the flesh from that area, the amount that is the width of the sharp lower eyelid, so that it may be the eyelid. (This refers to trimming excess flesh to properly shape the eyelid.)
Then join the separated parts and sew them together with wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it is raised (i.e., the eyelid is swollen or inflamed) because of a fissure, suture, or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid according to what has been described previously. Then separate [the wound/lips] with a poultice between two lips, as we have said.
In summary of the discourse on the treatment of an abscess, whether above or below, let the operation proceed as prepared in the manner of an abscess, and this is in the form of various kinds.  (This refers to the various forms or types of abscesses and their treatments.)
And the skilled artisan always prepares instruments in every possible way to restore the figure to its natural form, or near to it, and [adapts the treatment] to the patient according to the operation and instruments that are most suitable.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men, such that the eyelid is solidified above with the white of the eye and is prevented from its easy movement and natural functions, then it is necessary that you insert the tip of the instrument under the eyelid and lift it up, or spread it with an unguent (ointment).
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed, but rather somewhat blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision be such that it separates that adhesion easily, until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distill into it honey dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small, thin instrument, and place on the eye wool infused in egg white, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of a nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and resembles hard, fine horn; or it is non-nervous, resembling a congealed white humidity, which when an iron touches it, or it is forced to be removed with an instrument, is cut off and the instrument is not inserted into it.
And both types do not begin except from the major tear duct until it grows little by little, covering the sight and preventing light and movement of the eye.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient places his head in your lap, and then you open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and then you grasp the nail with an instrument of little thickness and extend it to the upper parts. And then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or double the end of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the edge of the nail which covers the pupil. And thus you draw it with the hair into the back of it.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that by the incision of it there is no continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with the instrument alone extended or with thread, as we have said, and then it is scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is its form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, into the wound, put a little crushed salt or a poultice made of hellebore, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is necessary until it heals.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it fixed with the instrument, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the wound of the patient and take a thin lion spatula of polished steel, according to this form: with subtlety.  (or: delicately; skillfully) And if you see that it is rarefied and has gathered and rooted itself there, then distill from your hour into the wound a poultice made of hellebore or with rue or with crushed salt, and plug the wound until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it until all that is there is removed, unless on the contrary a hot abscess forms in the wound, for then you leave that, and treat the abscess initially until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it reasonably until it is healed.
The eminence of the lachrymal flesh, if it is noticeable in the wound as a great hindrance, should be suspended with hooks; and incise it in part, and do not extend the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
Then distill into the lachrymal duct a poultice of rue and hellebore until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a fistula and that which is born of flesh adhering to the wound.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is born and grows until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses upon the eyelids, strongly constricting the eyelids at the edges and resembling a balustrade rose (a type of fleshy growth).
But the operation is that the patient rests his head on your lap; and then open the eyes of that one and gather all that flesh with appropriate forceps for this, and hold it with forceps or a pair of tweezers; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and be careful of the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision, with which you incise those things, be with a spatula, which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which hair is collected, as the form of it will suggest in this chapter.
Then, when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it a red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a bandage over the outside of the eye with egg white until it is secured from a hot abscess.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and hot blood is secreted, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat that abscess with whatever reduces that abscess, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly do in the case of fleshy growths which occur in the eye of this type.
But however, you must avoid any treatment of the eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member can tolerate that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is a thick, red vein which forms on the eye and hinders its function, and weakens the eye over many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and there is no other illness besides the pus; then you may collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an onch or two, according to your judgment; and let that onch be of subtle doubling according to this form:
or two onches gradually joined in one piece according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and are retracted.
And be careful that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is in the midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation that you incise only those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill into the eye verdigris or [a] red [substance] so that with its sharpness it corrodes what is left of the splinter.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that alleviates his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is soothed and the risk of a hot abscess is avoided.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Concerning the reduction of a nasal fracture.
When you treat a fracture with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as previously described, and it is not healed, then there is no pus within it, but rather fissures over the abscess before its maturation.  And extract all the moisture that is within it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
And thus, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and let it be made of Indian iron, and let its head be round like a button, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle filing (as it is in the following form).
And place that [rasp] upon the corrupted place of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that that corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the place with drying and styptic substances.
Then, if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the body is separated from the healthy part and remains so for forty days, and is not renewed [i.e., the corruption does not return] and is not suppurated and no accident befalls it, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is nothing to do but reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this manner:  that is, you uncover the second bone with an iron or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a rasp according to this form:
Let the extremity of the iron rasp be triangular, and its shaft be thin and tapered to the extremity, like this.  (The phrase "like this" implies a diagram would accompany the text).
And then place that [rasp] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the rasp until it penetrates all the bone, and the patient will feel it because he will feel the wind escaping as you move your hand.
Then restore the place with styptic and drying medicines as has been shown to you.
Then, when the flesh grows and the place is hardened, the matter which flowed to the outside parts returns to the nose, therefore this is easier for the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety and there is no accompanying damage, diminution, or weakening, then you should leave the patient alone and closely observe them.  Apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suck [the blood] for good evacuation; then apply to the eye an ointment made from  acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and firmly fasten the plaster to the eye with plenty of powder.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make [a poultice] from those.
And then place those [cloths] one on top of the other according to the amount the eye needs. And then bind those [cloths] with a firm cloth with strong compression; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound both day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it should be bound very tightly.
And then remove the binding both day and night, as we have said.
And if sometimes the eye is already reduced, it is good, and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the eminence of the uvea. (or Concerning the incision of the prominence of the uveal tunic)
When there is a rupture in the uvea, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the appearance of a man is marred by it, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below to above, and then place another needle with double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate and leave the first needle according to its disposition; and then incise the place of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle, and tighten it greatly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and leave it until the thread with the uvea falls away.
And then treat the eye with that which comforts it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth around the eye a great prominent swelling, and then it should be perforated with a fine spatula that reaches to the pupil of the eye, and the albuminous moisture will flow out, and the eye will descend and enter immediately.
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of alconati (likely a type of eye affliction or injury).
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a swelling which is attached to the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and gently pull it until you see the swelling descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried and not descend, and light should be avoided, and the patient should see things as he used to see.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the swelling is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a fine spatula and use it on the pannicle, carefully around the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the crown (near the empty space), until the swelling is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of the descending water of the eye.  (Or: Concerning the treatment of the watery discharge from the eye.)
We have already discussed the types of watery discharge in the division and which ones should be perforated, as stated above; therefore, this [treatment] according to the health [of the patient]. (A more literal but less clear translation might be:  "We have already said the species of the water in the division and which ones suit to perforate with sermo declaring, then that one according to the health.")
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and bind his/her healthy eye, tying it tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his/her eye, if the eye in which the water is located is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then place the end of the almond near the cornea, along the edge of the iris in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller tear duct, and then press the almond gently and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate the white of the eye and feel that the almond has already reached the empty space (or, the source of the problem).
And it should be that the distance of the almond to the pupil is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness (iris), which is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunic (cornea).
And then place the almond into the place where the water (fluid) is, and then you draw it down one time and then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then the patient sees what is above him immediately, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you remove it another time before the almond is discarded.
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond easily, and gently roll it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and wash the eye inside with it; and then place on the outside of the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with this.
But we and those of our time put on that [wound] crushed comfrey with egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness — for there are some men whose eyes are very hard — then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called an alberid, of which this is the form:
Then perforate that joint with it, and do not thrust your hand into the hole, but only make a subtle passage for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, a suitable sleeping place should be prepared for the patient, where he may sleep on his back in a dark room, and all movement should be prohibited.
And position him in such a way that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the dressing remain according to its disposition until the third day.
Then unbind it in that dark room and expose the affected area to view. Show him certain things, and then reapply the dressing by the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that you do this during the hour of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Having said that, you must avoid this because the water may leak slightly due to great and vehement movement.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you must unbind the wound before the seventh day, and treat it with something that reduces the abscess.
Then you wash his face and place a cloth on his face through which his vision will be obscured for a few days while he remains in the dark room.
And then let him be removed from that dark room gradually and he should talk about his condition.
And know that in this case the pupil is not excused from some visions, and then you should be bold about the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artaix, and someone said that a fire was made in Ayrac, a perforated oven with which water was drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the types of oven for those who are ignorant of them:
And let them be made of bronze or iron, properly, and let their extremities be of this triangulated subtlety, the pointed extremity thus, as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of raw flesh in the nose.
When diverse growths of flesh are born in the nose, some of which resemble a very small scorpion, or a polyp fish; and this sickness is called polyp because it resembles that fish in appearance. And from it is cancerous flesh, patchy, of dark color; and from it is flesh like a lion, not of dark color.
Therefore, in that which is in these fleshy growths, neither fraudulent nor cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands and placed in the sun, and open their nostrils, and prick your fingernail in those growths. Then extract that to the outside parts, and then incise what you have grasped of those with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; that if any part remains from which excision is possible, then you scrape that with one of the fine instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it bleeds profusely or a hot abscess forms, then you apply to it what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you incise and cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the cavities are cleared.
Then let there be poured into the nose near the incision, strong wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and humidity proceeds from it into the palate, then know that it is now healed.
But if the humidity does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is rotten flesh in the deeper bones of the nostrils to which excision has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce a linen thread into which some thickness has been added, and tie knots in it, and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and then guide the patient and introduce one end of the thread into the nostrils with a rod or with any other instrument that is available.
And after this is done, let him draw in its scent until it reaches the nasal passages and is expelled through his throat, for often children do something similar at school, and it is an easy thing for one who wishes to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end emerging from the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then administer sawdust of meat with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread, and place near the nose, close to the extraction of blood, a poultice, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the rotten flesh.
Finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a more drying cure, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a nasal purge-maker, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make it of silver or bronze, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the spout similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the nasal purge-making instrument should be flat and open; to which there should be a handle at its rear, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water, or whatever you wish of the juices and extractable substances.
Chapter 25.
Of nasal polyps in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a polyp grows in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in some days, until it is very noticeable to the observer.
And for this it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. And then apply to the location either cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in its place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is solidified, hard, of dark color and with little sensation; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; for many times he who incises this abscess suffers great harm from it, on account of the malignancy of the one who had it.
And if the abscess is of a light touch and not of dark color, and sometimes incision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and cure the place with that which dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should place little confidence in that operation except in certain men.
Therefore, when it happens to someone with any of these conditions, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you should join the two edges of the wound with a suture, and then cure it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then it is necessary that you scrape each part of its apparent surface until blood comes out. Then join the two edges with sutures and tighten them, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood and finely crushed incense, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or of any other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it bound for two or three days, and then unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the stitches are naturally shed, and then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of the suture is that you close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have recounted in the suture of the abdomen, or close the solution of continuity with thread, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the extraction of those things which have entered between the two lips in the inner parts.
Many times there appear in men in the inner parts of their lips certain hard abscesses resembling kernels, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Then it is necessary that you evert the lips and separate each of those hardnesses from every part, and afterwards fill the place of the excision with crushed sage until the blood is restrained, and afterwards let it be washed with sharp wine and the place be treated with something that is styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the incision of the flesh adhering to the gums.
Very often there grows upon the gum flesh that adheres, which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you lift that up with a hook or that you hold that with forceps and incise that to its root, and allow the pus or the blood to flow.
And afterwards place on the area crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for afterwards the cautery will not return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the reason for teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, sticky, and sometimes blackened scabs are attached, and they become citrine or green where they touch the gum, causing corruption and making the teeth sticky.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and rest their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those scabs and similar things appear, like sand, until nothing remains of them, and this removes the blackness, the yellowness, and the others, until they are cleaned.
Therefore, if what was in those at the beginning of the treatment is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on those on the next day, and the second, and the third until you arrive at the desired end.
And know that the teeth require many scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped on the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you cure the tooth of its pain with all diligence and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that compensates for its loss once it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance whose extraction is excused.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is diseased, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he believes it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, once you are certain which tooth is diseased, and you know it well, then you must scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, initially little by little until it is completely loose.
Then apply strong, large forceps for good traction or firm hold, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold it well and it does not move, and then extract the tooth straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not dislodged, then take one of those instruments, and place it under it on all sides with ease and force its removal in the same way as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or eroded, then you must fill that crack with cloth and tighten it with the end of a fine thread so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening with the forceps.
And you must open carefully with scarification around all parts of the gum and watch your strength so as not to break it and leave a part of it behind, and return to the patient because the harm may be greater than the first pain he felt.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity concerning extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are more difficult to cure, and their roots remain embedded, all or some of them, or that you extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed.
And then, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or soured wine with salt.
And if bleeding ensues from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of sage and sprinkle it on the wound, and if this sage does not stop the bleeding, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and the delicate tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should be long in the gripping part, short and thick in the handle, so that they do not bend when you work with them.
And let them be, as it were, of thick handle so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent; [let them have] short gripping ends.
And let them be made of Indian iron, preferably made with straight ends, and at the ends of these let there be teeth, of which some interlock with others and tighten by strong constriction; and sometimes the ends of these should be in the shape of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the extraction of teeth and the removal of broken jawbones.
When you must extract a tooth which is broken, and some cause remains, then it is necessary that you apply a poultice to the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then introduce pincers or forceps, the ends of which resemble the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Their ends should be made inside like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you in this way with these forceps or pincers, then it is necessary that you excavate around the root and clear away all the flesh and introduce the instrument which is called *atali*, that is, a small lever whose shape is this:
And let it be of short, somewhat thick extremity, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is extracted, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is of a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and of a more subtle extremity.
And now you are aided by this instrument having two ramps, of which this is the form, approximately the following: and with other instruments which precede in the scraping of teeth; for help is given with this instrument which resembles a large hook, and this is its form:
of the triangular, curved or short extremity, which should have some thickness, and should not be bent so that it is not broken.
And also know that the instruments for loose teeth are similarly made to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artificer in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the diverse illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses to which the ancients did not give or devise a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it is possible, then it should be cured in that place with what is convenient to it from among the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help yourself with a splint of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness to it little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely set; and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
But if in the bone there is a small rottenness, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, their shape is unsightly, and this is especially true for women, and especially for venerable old women; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is next to another tooth, and neither extraction nor filing is possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with an instrument of this form; it is similar to a boar's tusk, and is made of Indian iron, with a very sharp point.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are damaged.
And if the protruding tooth is suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And let the entire file be of Indian iron and very smooth; and let it have very fine points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and is filled so that the tongue is not injured nor the speech impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth are damaged by concussion and loosening due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated it with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then so that they do not fall out, let those teeth be fastened with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and soon becomes powdery after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the manner of binding is that you take the wire and pass a double strand between two healthy teeth, and then let it increase with two turns of the wire between the damaged ones, whether one or many, until the wire reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began, and tighten with your hand gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you fasten the wire, be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends in each place, and bend them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly bound.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner.
And this is the form of the teeth and the manner of the binding of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, as you see these bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to their proper places, and are grown back as we have recounted, and that they are healthy again.
And only a good and skilled craftsman does this.
And sometimes some material from cow bones is suitable, and it is made from them in the form of a tooth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and is fastened as we have said, and remains and serves in that place for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which is under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then incise that ligament, following its width, until the tongue is freed from its constraint.
But if in that area there is some hardness or knotting, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you should use an unguent and dissect it across its width until you have incised the ligament and the knotting is resolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the depth of the flesh and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
And then wash the site of the incision with warm water or with sour wine or with cold water; and then place under the tongue a linen cloth; that is, a piece of cloth that the patient should keep under their tongue each night, so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess similar to a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting facing the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancerous.
And if it is tending towards white, and there is moisture in it, then you place the hook there and incise it with a thin spatula, and incise it completely; and if blood flows during your operation, then place crushed vitriol on it until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with sharp wine and salt; and treat it with the other remedies for this until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36.  Concerning the extraction of an abscess from both ears and from what is festering in the throat and other abscesses.
When a swelling occurs in the throat, these are glands that are gathered together like cotton, which protrude outwards and are called tonsils; and if you treat them with what we have said in the previous section and it is not healed, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark in color, and insensitive; if so, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then either you will extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is something that should be incised.
And the operation is that you should consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already matured with complete suppuration or if it has diminished in any way; then make the patient sit before the sun, with his head in your lap, and open his mouth, and the assistant, taking it between his hands, should press down the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument, which is of this form:
And let it be made of silver or bronze, and let it be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with this and the abscess is shown to you, and you have observed it carefully, then take an oncia [ounce, possibly referring to a type of surgical instrument or a quantity of medicine] and put it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can. Further, if you pull out some matter from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Further, if you pull out some matter from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner of incision, and immediately after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and immediately treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two [near the ears], and incise those according to what I have said in the incision of two sides equally.
And I myself once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat, which abscess was tending towards a dark color, with little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her eating and drinking water, and she was on the verge of death if she had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had created two openings from which pus emerged.
Then I treated it with a fistula (incision), and I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out, and immediately I incised it from where I understood from the other opening, and immediately I opened its mouth, and compressed its tongue, and immediately I inserted the probe into that abscess.
And immediately I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Then the throat of that woman was completely clear, and she immediately began to drink water, and soon afterwards she took food.  Then I did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in the place of that one, which I incised until it was eliminated.
Then I cauterized her throat, therefore I desisted from further treatment; and immediately I left, and I did not know what God would do about it afterwards.
Chapter 37.
On the incision of a boil when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a buba (a type of swelling).
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your treatment is not successful, and you see that the abscess is already detached from it and is subtle, then you should incise that which is round and aggregated; and if it is of such a length, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and it is not sensitive to the patient, then you should attempt its incision, for in that there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, its whiteness and length, make the patient sit and press their tongue with an instrument which follows its shape, and then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments which are mentioned in the incision of two boils (or, possibly, 'two humors').
And you should not incise it except what is appropriate to the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more of it, you will injure his speech.
And after the incision, use what we have recounted in the incision of two boils (or, possibly, 'two humors'), and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by its incision, you should use ingenuity in its cauterization without fear, and the manner of cauterization is only with sharp water (vinegar?), and it is that you place the patient's head in your lap, and then press their tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with that live coal, and do not apply it thickly or thinly, and with it fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
Let its extremity be concave, in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus runs from their mouth because of the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it onto their throat and harms it.
And then hold your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and insert the spoon with the cotton into a cannula from above so that the cotton adheres to that cannula, and do this as many times as necessary until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it as it will dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and clean with it what remains around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat it externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cautery or incision, for it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, dried arabic gum, chamomile,  and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sharp wine, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with suitable clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which a concave brass instrument is placed in this way; it should be made of silver or brass.
And insert the end into the patient's mouth so that the vapor reaches the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is thoroughly fumigated.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the development of an abscess, for it would increase the abscess too much, and you should not do that, but rather cauterize the evident abscess.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is protected, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and that which adheres in the throat and other causes.
Many times something adheres to the throat, a fish bone, or some other cause.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which is apparent of those things, upon which your sight falls, after you have drawn the tongue forward with an instrument, in the sunlight, so that that which is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the cause attached to the throat will be expelled by vomit; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of dried sea sponge, strongly bound with thread, and let the patient swallow it, for when it arrives at the place where the thorns are, it will extract them, and then they will be expelled. And further, take an eel, bound with thread, and let it be inserted and quickly withdrawn; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly withdraw it.
But if they are not expelled by those means which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be somewhat thicker than a finger, and at its extremity let there be a concavity which you may easily introduce into his throat.
And let him have his head raised upwards, and be careful not to touch his throat bone, lest it cause him pain, and with that push out the bone or spine, or let the physician do it with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself introduce it, because of his knowledge of the location of the affected area, and push downwards, and pull his hand up with the instrument, all this according to the amount that is prepared for him, until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it doesn't work, then consider placing it on the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with gentle, careful movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a glowing iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches from the throat), and abstain the patient from all water that day.
Then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash his mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it, and stir the water every now and then with your hand, for as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cyperus or asafoetida, using the instrument which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of this is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals, and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then begin the fumigation; and the patient puts his mouth to the end of the cannula, and closes his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is drawn from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps like these, except that there is some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughness of filing, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the discourse on the opening of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many kinds, of many manners, as you will find a remembrance of them, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and incision of them by two manners, of which one is by the kind of abscess in itself; and by that which we understand of the humors.
And the second manner is according to the places in which they happen in the body, for an abscess happening in the head is different from an abscess happening in the buttock; and an abscess in the fleshy part is different from an abscess happening in a joint; and to each of them is its judgment for operation.
And moreover, of abscesses, there are some which it is necessary should not be perforated except near maturation of the pus in them or completion of them.
There are other abscesses which it is necessary should be opened when they are raw, and are not matured according to their completion, thus as abscesses which are near the joints, for when an abscess is near a joint, its being there is prolonged until that which is in its circuit is consumed, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore a cause of contraction of that member is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured it will harm the principal member; or it is near the buttock, therefore perforate that which is not matured; and it is not necessary that you perforate it raw, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the buttock, so that its matter may not be consumed and be elongated to the inner parts of the buttock, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in such a way that it may not be healed. Moreover, it is necessary that you know the time of the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And you will know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and the cessation of the fever, and also the diminution of the redness and of the pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know that the perforation falls in the place lowest of the abscess and from which comes the healing of the protrusion.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or of the feet, and away from the tendons, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and, finally, in all equal places in which there is no reflection; for in those which are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you leave the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed according to the completion, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, the body of the pus is prolonged and much filth remains, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or of the body because of necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation or several incisions according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be incised and curved when it is made like bread and is ripe, like that which happens in cases of buboes and swellings.
And some of those are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a lunar incision are administered, and similar to those.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you must perforate it with only a superficial or flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you must perforate it and not worry about extracting all the pus at that time; having extracted a part of it, then dress the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and do this many times according to the degree until it is completely evacuated.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit is often dissolved with the exit of the pus, and the patient dies very quickly, and you open them.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation with which you perforate these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and consider whether the wound of the abscess is small, or if it is a flat incision, then you apply lint or old linen to it; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you must place a wick in each opening until they join together.
And if a part of the skin is cut away in the abscess, or you have hollowed it out in the circumference, then you must fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have drawn out splinters or roots, without moisture; and bind it tightly until the third day; and then proceed and treat it with the ointments that are necessary until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you soak a linen cloth, and apply this to the place of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must apply the regimen and treatment and powders which I have recounted in many places in this our book and division.
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you must mix powders in warm wine and oil, and apply them to the area.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders mixed with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be kept cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and cleanse it and administer to its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the method of distinction, I have already spoken of each abscess and how to treat it in particular chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which appear in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses appear, a kind of nodes which contain membranes that are attached to them; and their types are many.
And some of them are purulent, and those contain a humidity similar to lime (or possibly, referring to a viscous, slimy consistency). And some of them contain a humidity similar to dust, and resembling them; and some of them are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of them does not cause contrary harm.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is similar to this, which is called an entromes (or similar sounding surgical tool), until you know what it contains.
For if that which it contains is humidity, then incise it with a cut along its length, with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G.  Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you should scrape that skin where the humidity was contained, and do not leave any of it at all, because often what is removed returns if any of it remains.
Then submerge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in salt water; and fill the wound with it and leave it there until the next day, for with this you will corrode all that remains of that film.
And then iterate on that cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed, until you are confident that there is no remaining part of that film; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you should incise it according to this form: with an incision in the form of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from every part, and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if the wound resists you, then do what I recounted to you first.
And similarly proceed with a lapified abscess in incision and cure as we have told you; and incision on a lapified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little humidity.
And sometimes some of these abscesses are found in the head of some men, in which there is no humidity at all; the reason for this is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other abscesses occurring in the head other than this, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses that appear on the heads of children and over the roots of the ears; but the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those in the lowest part of them so that the body may be relieved of the pus in the lower parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for that treatment.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42: On the incision of scrophulas which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, armpits, and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, many are generated among themselves, and every scrofula of these is within its own membrane, just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrophulas are many, for some are stony, some contain humidity, and some are malignant which do not yield to treatment.
Therefore, in that which you see to be of good disposition on touching, the color of which is clearly close to the color of the flesh, and is soft in every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper to the lower part of the body, from line G to line B, and scrape it from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is most important that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the instrument not be too sharp, lest it cause you to injure yourself with the incision, or disturb the patient, and that you incise what is not necessary to incise; for if you incise a vein or artery and you are prohibited from your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to fester. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then investigate with your index finger if there is any cause of other small scrofulas, then incise those and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, then you must not incise that scrofula at its root. Afterwards, it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then cure it.
And if you incise the whole scrofula, then you must adjust the two lips of the wound and sew it as soon as there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you see that there remains superfluity because of the size of the scrofula, you must understand how to incise its root, and extract it, and administer suture and what has been said.
And as for those scrofulas that contain humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place the perforation so that it is at the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound to be already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the abscess that accidentally occurs within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the throat, but no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the description/writing of the speech/discourse of those (people/authors).
But in men having quinsy, the extraction from the throat must be avoided, because no benefit is gained thereby, since all the veins and the largest ones of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the windpipe (trachea), it is necessary to use the incision of the throat to avoid the harm which is caused by perforation/suppuration.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the throat below three circles of the circles of the throat, or four, with a small incision in width between two circles; such that the incision is in the fleshy part, not in the cartilage.  This location is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant.
And if the physician is timid/fearful, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook, and then split the skin until he reaches the abscess, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
And then incise the fleshy part as we have recommended; and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which emerges from it along with what is broken up from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then, when the time for healing has arrived in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the skin of the wound and stitch it up, leaving out the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the sum of the discourse which we have recounted, the explanation is nothing other than that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient breathes above the site of the wound, through some opening for breathing, and is saved from death.
And for this reason, I order the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the disease is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I order the wound to be sewn up, and cure it until it is healed.
And what I have seen with my own eyes is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called to her cure, and I found the mucus as it is found in the dead, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come from the small wound.
Therefore, I was confessed that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the wind (breath) was coming out of the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in her voice, and after a few days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the incision of the tonsil there is no fear (or danger).
Chapter 44.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia (or possibly a goiter).
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and is very common in women.
And it is of two types, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural one is not capable of being cured.
And the accidental one is of two kinds, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other kind resembles an abscess which is caused by the knotting of an artery, and in this one there is danger. And one should not presume to use iron on it except in that which is small. And you probe that and investigate it with the finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you incise it like the nodes, and extract it with what contains it from the skin and the blister; and if not, then its whole being is explored, and then treat the area with what is needed for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount thus the difference between a node and an abscess, lest there be doubt.
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling of the superfluity is sedated; and putrefaction is complete, at which point the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that lymphatic fluid which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made like a bladder, either larger or smaller, and there are two types, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the cure of a node, that you draw out that [fluid] and inquire into it at the beginning with an instrument which is called a probe, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is near this.
And the manner of inquiry into abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will turn your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the core.
Then place your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess, and then remove the probe and consider what has come out in its wake.
And if the flowing humidity, of whatever color it may be, is expelled, then you incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the other abscesses.
And if you find no humidity in the wake of the probe, then know that it is fatty.
And incise it in the form of a cross, according to this shape: Thus as I have taught you, and suspend it with hooks, and easily peel the skin from all sides, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that pus with the node.
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the node will return to its former place.
And if you see that a small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound, and place a heated cautery over it, and treat it with other cures until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you sew the two lips of it and treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh (i.e., promotes granulation and healing).
But if a pulsating vein is found near it, or a non-pulsating one, then you consider and fill the area with crushed vitriol and let it remain there for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incise that which is the remaining part of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of those, the forms of the instruments are of three types: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, or lead, with properly rounded ends, so that they may easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called *albered*, and one of them is called *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form is:
The form of the medium instrument, its form is:
The form of the small instrument, its form is:
It is suitable that they be used for those abscesses and sores and fistulas and buboes, because among those are those from bones and other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of citrine brass, or of brass or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of citrine brass.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are agreed to be used to open fistulas in the cavity of which are reflections, so that they may be reflected with their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Form of the large lead instrument:
Form of the medium lead instrument:
Form of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are curved hooks, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and there are three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a manner except that it may be done skillfully in the scraping of the nodes, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve, and by these means the patient may be healed and find a little tranquility through the cauterization which he receives after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the forms of the cauteries, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you see.
They are made of bronze and resemble a ray, with which alcohol is made.  (Note:  The connection between the shape of the cautery and alcohol production is unclear and may be a mistranslation or a reference to a specific process unknown to modern understanding.)
And it is at the extremity where it is punctured with a hidden spatula, and in that way it runs to the parts inside and outside, when you wish, as you see. (This likely refers to the application of the cautery - the hidden spatula might be a tool for precise application or a way to control the heat).
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden among the fingers during the perforation of abscesses and the patient does not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium and small. And these are the shapes of those (spatulas):
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is interrupted, and there are three types: large, medium and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium and small, so that you can interrupt the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and when other medicine is not initially available.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the fleshy parts of the legs and thighs, the fleshy parts of the arms, and the breasts, belly, and elbows, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to small bladders, according to this form; through which blood is drawn when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round, according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the care of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflamed due to sleeping habits,  and then the breasts become swollen and resemble those of women, and remain suppurating, and white.
And for someone who has this, it is necessary that you incise those with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then approximate the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the breast sags downwards and is softened by its size, as happens in women, then it should be cut in its two upper parts, with two incisions similar to a lunar shape, each contained within the other at their ends, so that the larger line contains the smaller, according to this form, from line B to line G.  And then scrape the skin which is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and the powders which are necessary in the treatment until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what needs to be incised because of the patient's discomfort and bleeding, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses that come below the nipple.
These abscesses that appear below the nipple are a kind of scrofula, hard, and containing a sac-like skin.
And some of these contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you should fill it with old linen and leave it there until the next day.
And then the linen should be removed and the wound treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofula, then you should incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula.
But if the wound is so extensive that it causes putrefaction, then administer cautery as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from arrow wounds or from bloodletting.
When an arrow wound is broken and the scab which is over it is consolidated, then very often an abscess occurs.  The signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or vein are these: because when the abscess is due to an arrow wound, it is long and deeply seated in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a kind of creaking or grating sound within it.
And that which is from a vein is round and superficial on the body.
And incision of this abscess is dangerous, especially in that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should be avoided [incised].
But concerning that which is from them [abscesses] by inflammation of the opening of the arrow wound, make a longitudinal incision in the scab; and then open the incision with forceps and approach the arrow, and carefully separate the layers of tissue until it is uncovered.
And then place a needle there and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the arrow with doubled thread in two places—the method of which I have shown you in the extraction of two arrows which were in the temples.
And then prick the place which is between two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood which is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer treatment to where pus is generated until the ligaments fall away; and then treat that with ointments suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess from a severed vein, then you should hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can with the scab, and then insert the needle under the place which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be double thread in it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with good thread, as I have told you in the ligature of a grape [vein] in two parts with two ends of thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert the thread with that needle under the entire abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when what is in it has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the scab, and leave what is tied there.
Then place on it a powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, similarly abscesses occur in the nerves when they are struck or when they suffer excessive labor, and similarly.
And it is made worse in the locations of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are weakened.
And the abscess is serious, and it resembles the color of the other body, and it is in the worst conditions when it is constricted with vehemence, causing in the patient a similar stupor.
And the abscess is not aggregated in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the ribs, and it is weakened in every part and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be invaded with iron, for contraction will quickly result.
But that which is in the head or forehead, treat with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and excise it from the roots.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the area that occurs in the abdomen.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, those things which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and now the lips of those are turned, and it is of those that is small, and it is of those that is greatly magnified.
And I have already seen one, and in his belly were two things which were most like fungi, and there was no difference between those white things, of slender root.
And now the lips of those were turned inward and split open, and humidity flowed from it all the time.
Therefore I incised those and found in one about eighteen ounces, and in the other about six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the thing is white, humid, of subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let there be in your presence cauteries in the fire, for many times after the section of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind it to that thing, in the manner which we have said; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead greatly over the area, until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the thing is of thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise that which is of dark color, little feeling, and slow growth, for that is cancerous.
And I come with the reminder of cancer concerning this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia is caused by many things; either by fissures of the membrane which is over the belly, and from it protrudes the intestine or bowel as happens in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by constricted wind within it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the membrane and a protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the bowel, then its location is, as we have recounted, of greater variability, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and returns easily; and it is quickly large, and is much increased by the intake of baths and strenuous work.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the swelling is heavy, large and hard, and is located in a specific area.
But if it is due to flatulence, then the touch of it is soft.
And the operation in this case is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to arterial blood, or venous blood, or due to flatulence; then you must be prohibited from its treatment, because in that case there is fear and danger, as I have taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings due to artery and vein.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or hernia, then you must order the patient to hold their breath and lie stretched out; and then mark with a probe around the entire umbilicus, and then order them to lie between your hands on their back, and then encircle with a broad spatula around the umbilicus over the area which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling to the upper parts with a large inch; and then tie around it with strong thread or linen, in a proper manner of tying.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and search for the intestine; and if you have found it and secured it by the ligature, then you carefully extract and push the intestine back into the inner parts of the abdomen.
And if you have found the hernia, then grasp it with forceps; and incise its excess parts.
But if it is against your [better judgment because of an] artery or vein, then circle that area, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and thread with strong threads and insert the two needles into the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate; and then tighten the swelling into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the extended flesh dries and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thinned and dried, and then treat it with whatever ointments are necessary until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the navel is from flesh growing there or from humidity, then it is necessary that you concavity the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or humidity which you find there, and then treat it with what is necessary and which will consolidate the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of cancer and in what manner it is possible to treat it with medicines, and that it is necessary to avoid treating it with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have spoken of cancer, generated in the manner and caution of its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and in similar members, to extract all of it, and especially when it is starting small.
But when it is old and large, it is not advisable to touch it, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone else who has been able to.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and purge the patient and remove some black bile, and then bleed them, if a manifest repletion is found.
And then prepare the patient with a preparation in which the area to be operated on is situated, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then scrape from all sides with a good, sharp curette until no part of its roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not stop it lightly, and press the areas, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instrument among your instruments is possible for you.
But if a large flow of blood troubles you, from an incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood has ceased, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy of water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or the species of anasarca, for that is deadly.
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is not effective, then consider: for if the patient has already acquired debility, or has another disease along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain and similar ailments, then be careful not to treat him with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and he has no other illness but dropsy alone, and is neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of his operation is that you raise the patient between your hands, and the assistant then presses his belly with his hand, driving the water toward the lower part of the pubis, and then take a sharp lancet according to this form:
Let it be of two sharp points, long, with a sharp end like a lancet; but nevertheless let there be some small shortness in it, so that in the operation with it you do not pass into the intestine, and injure it.
And then consider if the generation of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you, with the incision, distance yourself from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, to the right of it, above the pubis.
But if the generation of the dropsy is due to a liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities run to that weak place.
And then perforate the entire peritoneum with the instrument, and then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the peritoneum and the omentum, and you should scrape that; and if [it is] the amount of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then perforate the omentum until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is the location of the water. And then extract that and introduce an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tin, to which in its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its incised extremity is shaped like a feather, thus:
And at its uppermost extremity is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that immediately rests on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a moderate amount, for if you evacuate more than is appropriate at that time, very quickly the patient dies from the resolution of their animal spirit, or you cause a collapse which is a sign of approaching death.
But evacuate according to the quantity of his strength and according to what the patient's disposition, the strength of his pulse, and his general condition signify to you.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the chain which covers the hole which is on the cup, of which I have already told you that you should pierce it in this manner.
And then repeat the procedure with the instrument on another day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and beware of error so that only a little water remains.
But if you are afraid for the patient and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with a burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and exposure to the sun for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 45.
Concerning the treatment of children born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urethra is not perforated (or is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation immediately after birth, using a very fine instrument, according to this method:
Then place a thin lead pin in the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be stimulated and will urinate; then return the pin.
And if you don't put in the lead, it is possible that the urine, which goes over the area, will not allow it to close.
But the one whose opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place—that is to say, those whose natural opening is located at the end of the penis, so that they cannot urinate in the normal way unless they lift the penis with their hand—this is not a generational issue because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line; it is a very long-lasting illness.
And the manner of the operation is that the patient should be positioned on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a forceful pull, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, making an incision like a feather, or shave a little portion, so that the middle of it resembles the head of the penis and the opening falls into the middle as it should.
And be careful in your operation to avoid excessive bleeding, for that often happens; and stop the bleeding with something that absorbs blood, and care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning phimosis, which occurs in the foreskin at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
This phimosis often occurs on the penis and is a swelling of fleshy matter.
And of that, one is malignant and another is not malignant.
If it is not malignant, you should suspend it with a fine thread and excise it until you have completely removed it; and then place on that wound something dipped in Egyptian ointment; and then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the phimosis is malignant, of a foul color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the phimosis is on the prepuce of the head of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the phimosis is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the phimosis which is inside first, until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside part, because if you treat both parts at the same time, it is not certain that the prepuce will not be damaged.
And if you find in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and is beginning to corrupt or is already corrupt; and then apply to that place a poultice of honey, mixed with flour from pomegranate rind and crushed and sifted herbs.
And then treat it with another [suitable] treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
Because cautery is beneficial for two conditions at once, that is, for the flow of blood and for the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you must insert a lead cannula into the meatus of the prepuce so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate those exquisitely, then you must scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and of the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when it is thin, is easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a very thin linen cloth, which has been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with astringent wine until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is done properly on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not discuss circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which is why I have found most practitioners and barbers use circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with scissors; and they use ligature with thread and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with scissors, with ligature with thread, than cleansing with the nail, because many times the skin peels off from above, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with an awl, and is digital, which shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not safe, because it easily enters the hole.
But in the operation with a nail, it easily causes suppuration and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience reveals to me, because the scissors are of proportional incision, for this reason that the sharpness which is above is the same as the sharpness which is below; and therefore as you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and compression of the thread is made with a shape containing the foreskin of the penis in every part, with which no error at all is made.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stay still, especially if it is one of those who understands a little, that you do nothing but tie the thread around its penis only, and that you leave it until the next day.
And then make it happy in every way that is possible for you, given its understanding. And then make the child lie still between your hands, prepared, and not fidgeting; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.
And then put your hand to its penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is exposed, and then cleanse it of whatever dirt is attached to it.
The shape of the scissors for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let one end be non-cutting and the other cutting, so that the nail does not come out, and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of two fingers.
But the error in circumcision is that you very quickly remove the whole inner foreskin, or part of it, below the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend that [foreskin] with your fingernail before the suppuration of the area and that you incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with forceps and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the inflamed prepuce, then you leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and then carefully incise it and cut it as you see fit.
And be careful of the glans of the penis, for that will not harm him.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure, and obeys the parts above, that will not harm him.
And moreover, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction due to a stone or congealed blood, or by pus or flesh, and similar to those of which we have spoken of the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said and the cause is vehement in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and subtly hollowed like a bird's quill, with the slenderness of a long ray, similar to a palm and a half in length, which has a subtle tube at its tip.
And the manner of drawing out the urine with this is that you take a doubled bladder and tie wool or cotton to its extremity with a good ligature; and introduce the extremities of the bladder into the part below the syringe, and cut with scissors if there is any superfluous wool, but insert it into the cannula with force. Then anoint the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and rub their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rosewater.
Then gently introduce the syringe until it reaches the root of the penis; then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has reached the void cause, and this is not done according to this order, but the meatus, through which it goes, is tortuous.
Then slowly extend the bladder with the wool, because the urine will wet the wool.
Then extract it and do it for urine cure, and use the syringe; do not cease doing this and using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a catheter and with similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals there, or putrefaction is constricted, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument that is called a catheter, and this is its form:
except that at its extremity it is blunt, that is, closed. And in it are three holes: two on one side, thus arranged.
In the beginning, it is a concave place, in which is that which is pushed in, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, except when any substance is drawn from the humidities with it, it should be drawn, and when it is expelled, with that it should be drawn, and when it is expelled lengthwise, as a catheter does with which naphtha is poured in sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to draw out humors from the bladder, insert the end of the catheter into the humor, and draw with it that which is pushed to the upper parts, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the urethra as we have described in the syringe; and then expel the humor with that which you expel, because that humor arrives at the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it.
The form of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the upper end should resemble a small feather, and below it a slender tube.
Then take a goat's bladder, and place in it the humor that you wish to instill into the bladder, and then tie it tightly between two ends with a double thread, and warm that humor over the fire.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the penis (urethra).
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it throughout its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is bound; and then attach the circle so that it is fastened to the instrument, so that you can place in it whatever you want of humors, oils, and waters.
Then tie that to the instrument and proceed with it as you did with the bladder, and express it with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stone and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and their symptoms.
And we have discussed the stone in which [one performs] an operation with the hand, and incision.
And the stone properly generated in the bladder is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that stones generated in the bladder mostly affect children; and among its symptoms is that the urine that comes from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient feels a burning sensation in his urethra, and often suffers pain, and is frequently in a bent posture; and with that he often expels feces.
And the healing of children from this is easy until they reach fourteen years; and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those [extremes, i.e., easier than in the elderly, harder than in young children].
And of that [disease] in which the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we purify the patient with a clyster which extracts all the excrement that is in his bowels; for this excrement sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during its examination.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet up and shaken and massaged gently so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it sometimes leaps from its place.
Then make that [the patient] sit between your legs, prepared, and his hands should be below his thighs, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
And then search for it [the stone] and everything else outside [the bladder].
Then if you feel the stone in the space [bladder], immediately consider making an incision upon it.
And if it does not descend completely from your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint your index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if he is a fully grown youth, and introduce it into his anus. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And bring it back little by little towards the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards towards the place where you will make the incision.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with her hand; and instruct another assistant with her right hand to stretch the genitals upwards, and with her other hand to hold back the skin which is below the genitals, near the place where the incision is to be made.
And then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: And incise what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size that the extraction of the stone allows, and no larger, because easily by compressing with your finger which is in the anus, the stone will follow the incision, and be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and jagged, which makes their removal difficult because of this.
And of those that are like a gland, and are round, the extraction is easily done.
Therefore, if it is one that has angles and edges, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus expelled, then you must push on it, or press on it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and do not let it escape; or introduce under it a slender instrument with a curved end.
But if you cannot [reach/work on] it, then you enlarge the opening a little, and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it by pressing on it with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at the beginning you place your hand at the opening of the bladder, and then incise it; and then gently push it out; and similarly do if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to incise it with a large incision, for it causes one of two things to the patient: either death or a continuous dripping of urine, because the place is not completely healed.
But administer its expulsion until it is expelled, or work on the fracture of it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Then, when you have completed your operation, fill the wound with shavings of aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over that a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be cooled.
Then lay the patient supine on their neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you have untied it, wash the area with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a hot, burning, and corrosive abscess, and of a similar appearance to blood frozen in the bladder, and because of it urine is prevented (and this is known by the emission of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction of it.
Then wash the wound with sharp wine, water, and salt, and with a poultice of whatever is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is fixed there, and the flow of urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I have recommended before resorting to incision, for many times because of this treatment incision is accused; and I have already proven this, and it is that you take a sharp iron perforator, of which this is the form:
of triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the penis below the stone with it so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches the stone. And turn the perforator with your hand on that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outer side of the penis, because it is broken, and it is expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you due to some reason that prohibits it, then tie one thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then incise the stone in that penis between the two ligatures. And then extract it. And then untie the ligature and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And the ligature of thread below the stone is not necessary except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other ligature above only because, when the thread is untied after the extraction of the stone, the stone returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the thread above, that you elevate the stone to the upper parts, or that it return to its proper place, and close the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone is found in one of them, then its cure is difficult, and is forbidden in many ways.
One reason is that a woman is easily made a virgin again.
And the second is that you will not find a chaste woman, or one who is married, who willingly reveals herself to the physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the place of incision for a stone in women is far from the stone itself, so a deep incision is needed, and there is fear in that.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must take a female physician who is knowledgeable, and they are rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skilled and subtle physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge in this art.
Then present her, and command her to do all that you instruct, from the initial examination for the stone; the reason for which is that if she is a virgin, she should insert her finger into the woman's rectum and search for the stone.
Then, if she finds it, she should grasp it with her finger, and then you should instruct her to incise it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with good pressure.
Then, if she finds it, she should gradually draw it out from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the sum of her strength until it reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise it near the position of the middle of the vagina below the root of the thing, wherever it is found stopped, and center the stone in that part, and her finger should not be removed from the stone while grasping it.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size that you know the stone will be extracted from.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore you should know how many types there are of them so that you can signify what you desire.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And make sure you prepare with you the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then place powder on the area and compress it with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then treat the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the area is dry, then you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of humidity in the white sheath which is below the seam of the genitals containing the testicle, and it is called the sheath.
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane which nature prepared for it in the part of the testicle, so that it is as if there were another testicle; and this is the seam of the genital between the white sheath which we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a later development.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this humidity has many colours, for its colour is either inclined to yellow or to blood-red, or red, or it is black and foul-smelling, or it is a clear white, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white sheath which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, inclining slightly to length, like the shape of an egg, and it surrounds the testicle, for the humidity contains it on all sides.
And if the humidity is in the proper membrane, then the abscess is round near the part of the testicle and for this reason one believes it to be another testicle.
And if the humidity is between the tunic of the genitals and the white sheath, then it falls below the feeling/sensation.
And if you want to know the colour of the humidity, then you test the colour of the humidity in the abscess with a lancet, whose shape precedes the testing; and according to what comes out on the surface of the lancet, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its cure with iron, then it is necessary that we order the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and you see his body full (of blood).
And then let him lie supine on his back on something a little raised, and place many cloths under him.
And then sit on his left side, and command the assistant to stand on his right, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides to the tunic of the genitals and to the part of the navel of the belly.
And then take a broad spatula and split the tunic of the genitals in the middle lengthwise almost to the perineum.
And let the incision be made straight and evenly distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the included white fatty tissue (cyphax).
And scrape that, and observe, and beware that you do not incise it; and your scraping with which you scrape it, let it be done lightly and subtly, examining with the scraping as much as possible.
And then perforate the water-filled fatty tissue with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the fatty tissue to the upper parts; and do not touch the tunic of the genitals underneath, and incise the fatty tissue in whatever way is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not carefully examine its incision, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the water flows from outside its tunic during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the fatty tissue, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the tunic of the genitals with a suture, and then care for it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the swelling corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the suspensory ligament, and extract the swelling, and then care for it with what we have said.
But if the water is collected in two parts together, then know that there are two hernias; therefore, incise that part in the same way that you did the other; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then you do it.
And then you wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place on the outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the genitals and the miracle of the belly; and place on top folded cloths and powders, and bind those on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then let two cloths be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and let the ends be made with which it is bound of cotton or damp wool, and let them be attached with a band to the waistband of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the buttocks to the thighs, and the second should reach to the groin area, and two ends should be on the two thighs and two other ends on the two knees, and the whole binding should be fastened in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have recounted until the white cyst containing the water is uncovered, and then you take a cautery of this form: and it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce the cyst with that [cautery], and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then spread the cyst with unguents, and scrape with unguents, and scrape with a thin, ignited cautery; and incise it as much as you can until you eradicate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg.
And know that this operation is safer and less prone to blood flow, and better than operation with incision.
But if an abscess causes you difficulty during incision or cauterization, or bleeding, then you must treat whatever difficulty it causes you, with the treatment that is appropriate for it, as has been said.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I have recommended; and this is when you are certain, because of what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some raised seat, then perforate the abscess in its lowest part with a broad spatula, and position the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough that all the water drains out.
And then place a cloth over the area and bind it, and leave it, so that the remaining water drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is an obstruction to the drainage of the water, at that time you perforate it: and this is done only because the white panniculus in the orifice of the wound creates an obstruction and prevents the exit of the water; then you must put into the wound a probe or instrument with which the water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which is described above; or adjust a small opening in the wound's obstruction.
And know that the water will return, and it will be accumulated again within six months or thereabouts; and when it is accumulated, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus spend their days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is a danger leading to death in the most favorable dispositions; therefore, in my opinion, its removal and salvation by that means is better.
And I am recalling the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the genitals which are composed of several things, and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, acrid superfluity which is poured into the genitals, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess follows the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a petrified abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by inflammation of them, so that its swelling is perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it is not fitting that this should be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means through compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision is made on this kind and on the other parts; and it is so that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then extend the testicle to the upper parts, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament, and ligate it, and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from all parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then you must extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between some part of the sheath, or between that which is between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then you must incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a hernia that is of the scrotum (or, a scrotal hernia).
A scrotal hernia is an abscess enveloped by a certain covering similar to dough, with softening of the testicles, and it makes exercise and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is important to remember what preceded it, for fear of what caused it.  (Alternatively:  And the treatment of this illness requires recalling what preceded it, to avoid recurrence.)
However, we must describe the operation in the way the first physicians did.
And I say that you should make the patient sit on a raised chair; and then push the suspensory muscle of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers and thumbs, along with the vessels that are proven to be near the penis; and have another assistant help you, and extend these with strong extension.
And then incise with a wide, sharp scalpel, with a transverse incision, to the right of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then, scrape away all the parts as we have told you in the extraction of arrowheads which are in the temples.
And then place in those a needle with double thread, and tie it at the first of the places where you saw blood, and tie it another time at the end of them. And then incise those in the middle place with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is accumulated of fetid and corrupted humors.
And then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which you wish healing to be engendered so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitalia fall, for it is not harmful on account of that.
But if blood flows from all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be tied off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they are atrophied, or that they dry up so that there is no help with them.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen on the side of the inguinal rings of the abdominal muscle, so that the intestines descend from that rupture into one of the sacs of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur from many causes: percussion, jumping, shouting, lifting something heavy, or similar actions.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it is an inguinal abscess towards the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and it is an abscess appearing differently below the groin, close to the appearance, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body in the parts outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" appears to be a variant or possibly a mis-spelling related to the type of hernia; a precise modern equivalent is difficult to ascertain without further context.)
And sometimes it is formed with flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, and this is a great danger for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness with iron (cautery) there is danger, therefore the cauterization should be avoided in that case.
And the method of operating on this is that you instruct the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the inside of its cavity if it obeys its return, and then he should be placed on his side between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then hold the spermatic cord, which is the cord of the testicles, upwards, and incise the spermatic cord lengthwise; and then insert into the two lips of the incision hooks, as you would need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the egg (testicle) to be expelled.
And then scrape away the sheath which is under the spermatic cord, until the white, hard tunic is uncovered in each part.
Then you insert your finger into what is the testicle, into that which is between the white tunic, which is under the cord of the testicle, and between the second tunic, and resolve with this the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the testicle.
Then gently manipulate the spermatic cord upwards with your hand, and with this, stretch the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunic to the site of the incision; and instruct the assistant to hold the testicle upwards while you dissolve the adhesions at the back with complete resolution.
And search with your fingers that there is no bowel enveloped in the hard white tunic. But if you find any such thing, then you should push it back into the abdomen below.
And then incise in the part below the spermatic cord, through the incision of which blood and pus will flow, just as we have recounted in what we have said.
Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have recounted (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we have said is done near the incision to prevent blood flow, because this often occurs) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and place it on until it falls off as we have said.
Then treat the wound with the other treatment for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of a ventosity hernia.  (Or: Concerning a windy hernia)
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has dared to treat it with iron.
And the first [doctors] said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that [hernia] with ease; and then dry the middle place around the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels fall [away/collapse].
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that is made in the inguinal region.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and it swells the area.
And do not allow the genitalia to be a cause of the intestines in the genitalia; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all times.  (This is a difficult sentence, the meaning is somewhat unclear due to archaic phrasing and possible medical terminology that is now obsolete.  A possible more modern interpretation is:  And do not allow the intestines to protrude into the scrotum (or genitalia); and if some do, it is a minor protrusion; and it returns at all times (or frequently).)
But if the time with this is prolonged, a fissure is made in the inguinal canal until the intestine descends into the inguinal canal; and this happens because of the extension of the inguinal canal, which is in the groin as we have said, which is the cause because the inguinal canal is stretched, and then it is softened, and the area is suppurated and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as its description has preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with incision across the width according to the quantity of three fingers.
And then tighten the white inguinal canal that is under the testicle until it is uncovered (or revealed).
And then take the ray (presumably a surgical instrument) and place that on the prominent area of the inguinal canal, and press that to the front of the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent places on the end of the inguinal canal's ray (instrument), and join one of those to the other with a suture.
And then remove the end of the ray (instrument), and do not incise the inguinal canal completely, nor extend the wound, nor any other cause, as I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment for wounds, and as you incise the fibers, clean it and repair the wound until it is consolidated; because the inguinal canal is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not set (or reduced).
And cautery is better in this location, because it is closer to health (i.e., promotes healing).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the scrotum.
Many times the scrotum in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is damaged.
Then it is necessary for the one who is charged with its cure to make the patient lie on his back, and to sew up all the scrotum which is softened over the natural scrotum; and then to join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, sew in the beginning the superfluity of the softened scrotum with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then treat it with the treatment for other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
Concerning castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because it is fitting for me to mention it in this book, and its mention is necessary only in two ways: one is so that it is in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, that he knows the treatment for one who has suffered it; and the other way is that we often have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit from them, such as horses, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by incision.
But in that which is done by crushing, the method of operation is that we cause the animal to be immersed in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the scrotum of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise over each testicle with an incision until both testicles protrude.
And then incise them after you have skinned each one. And do not put any dressing on those of the cyphus, except the fine cyphus which is on the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by crushing, because strong crushing leaves no cause of the testicles whereby the beast desires copulation.
And then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two kinds: one is where it appears that there is a space in the scrotum, in that which is between two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that which is in the scrotum.
But in women there is one type: and it is that the vulva above the mons pubis is like two testicles of a man, somewhat smaller on the outside part, like a man's prepuce, and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those adhering flesh until the impression of it disappears, and then you should treat those with the cure for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows that is in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A slight swelling is usually caused by natural causes until it is pressed and examined; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it spreads as in men and is visible during intercourse.
Then it is necessary that you hold the excess swelling with your hand or with a bandage and incise it.
And do not go too deep in the incision, especially near the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then cure it with the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
But a fleshy growth is flesh that grows in the womb of the mother until it fills it, and it quickly comes out of the parts outside like a tail (and because of this some first called this "tailed disease"); therefore we must incise it as we incise a swelling, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of sciatica.
Sciatica is when the vulva of the woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by improperly formed flesh or by a thin or thick membrane.
And it is formed either in the front of the vulva, or on its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part, and it prohibits coitus and conception and childbirth, and strongly inhibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by examination of the vulva; if the obstruction is apparent, it is straightforward; but if it is not apparent, then you should search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane, and is close to the two labia, then you should incise and break it up.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then spread the two labia forcefully until that thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the area, and keep it moist daily so that the incised area does not consolidate (heal too quickly).
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to an abscess, then suspend it with a hook, and incise it.
And have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and  plantain (enses), mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close up too quickly.
And keep it there for some days and administer a decoction of dry herbs.
And then it should be treated with the other consolidation cure until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the mother's birth of other flesh [likely referring to a difficult childbirth or postpartum complication], and then it is necessary to incise according to this manner. But if this is due to a cranial abscess, to the cranial abscess which is in the mother, no harm should be done with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and of a boil and of a red tumor that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the openings of many veins from which much blood continuously flows; and when they are old hemorrhoids and boils are formed.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the womb of the mother and do not appear externally, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron (cautery).
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which sensation falls (i.e., which are externally palpable), those are the ones that are cured.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cold place and then extend the boil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them at their roots.
And then sprinkle on those (hemorrhoids/boils) to stop the flow of blood, one of the incisive powders without biting (i.e., causing further irritation), such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of pomegranate leaves and bark, and walnuts, and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to his back.
And if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or in plantain juice, or in rue juice with old wine, and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of the rectum occurring in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the mother, such as cancer, and stony abscesses, and ulcerative abscesses, and  abscesses (possibly meaning buboes or similar), and herpes, and hemorrhoidal fistulas, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these diseases and their types and their signs, and their cures, in the previous section.
And it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of a hot abscess which occurs in the mother, when it is among the abscesses that collect pus, and if you wish to know in what manner the operation is performed with iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and sometimes it reddens and if you feel it, then do not attempt perforation, and treat it with what assists maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you must make the woman sit on a stool that has two legs; and she should recline on her back and adjust her feet to the lower part of her belly, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a suitable bandage to this.
And then the midwife follows from the right side and administers the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will be shown in those things that will be done next.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument that you place with it the neck of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument is entered into the womb should not be more than the neck of the womb and hurt the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the neck of the womb, then it is necessary that you place powders on the texture of the neck of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the neck of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the turning instrument on the upper side and that the person administering it holds the instrument and turns the instrument until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the wound appears, and is touched with the hand and is soft and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that with a linen cloth from the head downwards.
And when the blood has been evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the caul on the section in the neck of the womb.
And place outside the womb and on the vulva clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then let it be treated for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is rinsed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lilies or of long birthwort has been boiled, and then returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is located inside the closed womb, then you must be prohibited from treating it with iron,  taking care of it with what we have said in the previous section.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner live embryos should be treated when they are expelled in an unnatural form.
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the form of natural childbirth by its signs, and it is that when you see the woman straining in the lower parts and desires to smell the air, and because of that which is upon her during childbirth, she hastens the expulsion of the embryo, then you should know that this birth is according to the natural form, and it is the expulsion with its head first, and the afterbirth with that or suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily because when it descends headfirst, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with good purification.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and unfavorable, for when the embryo is expelled feet first and its body is expelled before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, and quickly it is turned upon its neck, and similar to those unfavorable forms.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is needed in them so that it may be signified by this and may be established upon this.
When the fetus is expelled headfirst by natural exertion, and this is strenuous for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women hold her, and evaporate her vagina with cooked fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, thin spatula between her fingers and tears the secundines with it, or scrapes it with her fingernail until she removes the moisture from it. And press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be irrigated with a mucilage of ptils and a mucilage of fenugreek with a syringe.
Then instruct the woman, during the irrigation, to be compressed and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you should reduce them carefully, little by little. But if it does not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs, and then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remains of the fetus, or tie the body to its hand with a cloth and extract it gently, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is positioned on its feet, then you should push them upwards, and gently turn the fetus, and gently grasp it, and gently take one foot and extend it little by little.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you command her to strain, and make her sneeze with a concoction, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled with what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for then it will be expelled with ease.
And if it is hindered by all that we have recounted, then take marshmallow mucilage and dissolved gum arabic, and pound it all well in a mortar, and gently apply this to the woman's vulva, at the lowest part of her abdomen. And gently make her bathe in lukewarm water, up to her hypochondria (the region below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts of her are softened, then make a fumigation of myrtle for her and place it under her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a seat, and gently make her sneeze and hold her mouth, and lift her up, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle compression, for the fetus will immediately be expelled.
Thus [support] the fetus laterally, holding one of its arms. Try to reduce [the dislocation] with your hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her hips with a vehement shaking, and then administer bandages which I have recommended, made of mucilage.
And if the labor has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction of the arm, and grasp the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
Thus [support] the fetus on the neck, spreading your hands, and its face is towards its mother. Let the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little, and let that happen easily.
And when it is grasped, then place on the neck of the child that which we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then command her to cough little by little, and when you have done that, then make her sit on a stool and command her to be inclined on her right side, and then command her to strain; and make her sneeze with a [sneezing] potion. The prepared fetus exits on the side.
When the horror of the mother decreases according to this manner, consider, and then you incise the secundine with your fingernail until it is evacuated of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over its face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it may not be retained and die.
And then push the fetus into the inner parts until you place it as needed, and instruct the woman to strain several times, and it will be expelled easily in this way, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is rare and seldom happens; but there are natural causes for it, and they do not live.
And count those, even if they are multiplied, as one birth, and they are separated by a membrane; distinguish them by the umbilical cord of each of them. And sometimes they are expelled as if it were one fetus by easy natural expulsion, and sometimes they are expelled by an undesirable expulsion as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver during childbirth and reach the point of what we have said about unnatural presentations, then you treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with patience, and is ingenious according to each presentation, as she is prepared by her intelligence leading to health.
Concerning that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which cause was explained by the measurement of glorious wise men.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife, because it easily appears similar to that, and therefore oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it is not expelled, and you are forced to use a hand operation, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted by any of the accidents that cause danger to her.
Then the woman should be placed on the bed on her side, her head inclined downwards and her thighs raised.
And the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mother's vulva with warm oil and with a mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the location where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, and then you grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or at the neck, or at the mouth, or at the palate, or under the chin, or at the clavicle, or in the appropriate places near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet-first, then at the perineum, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the umbilical cord with the right hand, and place its curvature in the space between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and grasp the cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until reaching the empty cavity.
And then place and attach another umbilical cord, or a third if necessary, so that the traction is even, and there is not extension only along its straight length.
Rather, it should be manipulated in every part, so that its expulsion is eased, just as is done in tooth extraction.
And it is necessary in this [context] that the extension be softened; and if some part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and expertly insert them and manipulate with them that which is retained.
Then, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then the cords should be moved to a higher position; and do this until the whole fetus is expelled.
But if the hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until all is expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should proceed with the other hand and with the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction occurs during its expulsion, or there is accumulated water on its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers expectorant saliva and split the head and extract the water, or to open it with an instrument which is named “alundat”, the form of which will be described with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is near this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with forceps as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is expelled but constricted below the clavicle, then it should be incised until the moisture which is in the feet is drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it obey expulsion, then you should incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the lower part of the belly is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the moisture that is within it runs out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its traction is easy and its direction to the mother's mouth is easy.
But if it is constricted around the belly and feet, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you incise the belly and feet until that which is within them flows out.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head returns, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mouth of the mother is open, then she inserts her hand into the womb, and searches with it for the head, and draws it with her fingers towards the mouth of the mother, and then inserts into it one or two fingers, and draws it out with them.
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted by a hot abscess which affects her, then it is necessary that it not be disturbed; beforehand it is necessary to administer an infusion of moist, oily substances. And administer plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then, if possible, it should be turned; and that which we have said for a living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then let it be incised in pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no part of the afterbirth inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said concerning the treatment of the hot abscesses which may occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead fetus, and shortly after that fire [presumably meaning pregnancy] again she became pregnant, and again the fetus died. It happened to him that for a long time there was an abscess in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound has not healed.
Then I applied to him plasters of strong attraction, and I extracted a bone from him; and after a few days passed, I extracted another bone; and I was very amazed, since there should not be bones in the abdomen.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in good condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, with a small amount of pus being discharged from her.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but because in this there is skill and help, that the skillful physician administers with his hand for healing.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of incision with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the books are bound, which binding has two incisions at the two ends of two sticks. However, this incision should be finer than the constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each stick be about two fingers, and the thickness of each about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle space between the two sticks are two fastenings of the same wood which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that she is opened with them when you turn the two aforementioned incisions.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity are two additions, thus shaped like V's, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the mother with them, then you make the woman lie down on the bed with her legs hanging down, having opened that which is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with forceps, gradually according to the amount you want to widen the opening of the mother's womb, until the womb does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The shape of the instrument with which the fetus is expelled:
The shape of the instrument with which a large head is grasped.  (The "2" likely represents a superscript or annotation in the original text, perhaps indicating a variant or clarification.)
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like tongs, and sometimes it is made long like forceps according to this shape, like tongs, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it is incised and grasped. The shape of a small instrument:
The shape of a hook having a spine (or point).
The shape of a hook having two spines (or points).
The shape of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed (or cut).
The shape of two broad spatulas.
All those instruments are exercised, and when the types of those are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the operation is easier and more valued by men because of its quantity (or abundance).
And do not neglect those instruments, whatever they may be, that you have prepared, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the secondine (afterbirth).
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully.  Squeeze your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if it is expelled by this means, it is good.
And if not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid. Place herbs inside, opening the mother's mouth [to inhale the steam], such as rue,  mint, chamomile, dried arabic gum, cassia lignea, and holy thistle (centaury). All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it is not expelled, then instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then introduce it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it.  And when she has found it, then take it and extract it little by little.  But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then she should insert her hand as we have recommended, and when she finds the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed, so that the mother does not faint from the violent traction. Afterwards, it should be moved to the right and left sides easily.
And if the mother's mouth (cervix) is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and medication with herbal oil.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have recommended, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction. However, what has emerged from the mother's womb, attached to the woman's genitalia, should be cauterized with ointment and tetrapharmacon; for this will cause it to rot within a few days, and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it rots, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then fumigations suitable for this should be administered.
But some of the Ancients already tried fumigation with henbane and dried figs.
Method of instrumentation with which a woman is fumigated because of retained menses and afterbirth:
Let it be made of glass or brass.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold that until that fumigation is consumed and then another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [likely referring to lead-based ointments].
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that develop below [likely referring to anal fistulas].
The fistulas that develop in the lower part are knotty and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space between the parts.
And it is one fistula or several.
And when that knot is old and discharges a watery white moisture or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because something comes out of them through emission and by flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from emission, and worms readily come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the space, entering the bladder and into the meatus of the penis; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the anus from one that is not penetrating, is that you insert your finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does any matter of emission, worms, or flatulence proceed from the opening, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its cure.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meatus of the penis, then its indication is the presence of urine from it and the prohibition of it so that the place may be consolidated with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the circumference, then its sign is that the probe penetrates there if there is no tortuosity in the bone, and pain in the circumference of the part; and that pus always issues from it; and that medication is of no use, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all, and the cure of those is the labor and vanity of foolish physicians, on which they are fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I shall recommend to you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lie between your hands on his back and raise his legs upwards, his thighs being inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your finger into the anus.
And if you feel with your finger the probe already discovered by itself penetrating, besides what you feel between your finger and that sac or flesh, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on that, for there is no healing in that, as we have said.
However, some say that it is healed in some men late.
And of the medication by which help is hoped for him is that you ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been previously described, and introduce that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those fleshy parts attached to the fistula, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, are cauterized.
And then treat that with poultices wrapped in linen until all those cauterized tissues slough off, and then treat that with flesh-generating and consolidating medicines, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it is not healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or a sac, and you see the fistula in such a way that it is the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will cut with the probe, and it will be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe arrives, and through the probe it is freed and exits.
And then cleanse those fistulous tissues which resemble the quill of a bird's feather and do not leave any of them behind.
But if you see a flow of blood come between you and your operation when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and easiest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good things: that is, cauterization of those attached tissues, and the stemming of the blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flax until the place is free of pus, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate hard flesh and promote healing.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and drying; when it is restored, it is healed and you do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore it with that.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a covering of fat or flesh, and it is suitable for penetration, then there is no operation there except by way of trust and hope.
Which requires one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its depth so that you can insert the poultices and the appropriate treatment; and do not proceed too much with incision lest you cut the muscle containing the rectum, and cause harm to the patient and thus death without his consent; and then treat it with what we have said, for it will be healed quickly; or lengthen that covering and clean it of pus after drying it near the rectum, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with a sharp tip, and then clean the fistulous flesh which is in the incision as far as you can with scraping; and then strive to effect the restoration of the entire wound with incision, and if the orifice above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the rectum, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the rectum near the surface of the body with the bend and at the margin of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for preparing skins in this manner:
and insert it into that [fistula] wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its depth.
But if it penetrates into the margin of the rectum inwards, then you pull the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the rectum; and pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for one or two days, and when you cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well until those parts of flesh are cut which are between the two ends of the thread and fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it should be very gently, because it is not for you to do this so that you do not cut the muscle; and then treat it with this until it is healed.
The form of the pointed probe with which the fistula is probed: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks similar to charcoal, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these, some are small and some are large, and blood flows from them constantly and it is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are, according to the months, of little humidity, from which flows a citrine liquid or a little blood with continuous discharge, and [the discharge is] according to the complexion of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to wash himself and to strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should carefully lift and suspend them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with rough cloth or cotton or a pledget of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders at the incision, so that they act in place of a cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not readily allow for protrusion, then  stimulate the patient with a small, mildly irritating enema, and let it be washed with that water which is in the anus, so that it may slightly protrude when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you should grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, you must suture in this manner: take waxed thread and insert it into a needle and then pull the hemorrhoids upward from the parts below, and make it penetrate with the needle to the root on the other side, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lowest part around the needle, and this should be done horizontally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a firm ligature, and then tie off the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them uncut, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that upon the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointment or another cure until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moist and the outer scab is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then remove them with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed much and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that a felon, that is, a whitlow, is nothing but a red, round swelling, similar in color to the body, resembling the head of a pin.  It is found throughout the body, but most often in the parts below the feet and fingers, and causes pain according to its growth.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the whitlow be incised, and held with forceps or a hook, and eradicated from its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is described in its chapter.
Moreover, a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you stretch and incise it, or that you bind it tightly with thread or a hair so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize that, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic substance).
Moreover, a mole is a small, hairy or fistulated, thick eminence on the surface of the body, often appearing on the face; and when friction encounters it, a sensation similar to the bite of an ant is felt, and it is found all over the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose or vulture quill, and let it be strong, and place that over the mole so that the circle of the cannula contains its parts; and then rotate your hand with the cannula so that you incise what is in the circumference of the mole, and place it in the depth of the flesh, and eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula, according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thinness, blunt (that is, non-perforated), covered so that the sensation of it on the finger is dulled and its rotation facilitated.
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as previously described in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the instruments which are used to give a clyster (enema).
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of tin, or of molten or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose anuses are fragile or painful, the clysters for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small clyster:
The head of the cannula above, to which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and let there be a distinction where the bag is tied, thus as you see.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (that is, not open) very smooth, tending towards subtlety; and on one side of it let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the fingers and a little larger.
And let the bag in which the medicines are placed be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its length be one palm [width].
And let it be perforated with many holes, so that it is perforated; and let the space which is between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong threads of raw silk, about ten threads, or thereabouts; and fasten the bag with them; and when the bag is placed in position, bind it tightly at the top of the clyster with two distinctions with strong constriction, and then cauterize each hole with that: But the method of cauterizing with this is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
And then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs and place under him a cushion on which there are already cloths or a sheet; and then lubricate the end of the clyster with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or similar; and then insert it into the anus easily, and then the attendant takes the bag and squeezes it with two hands and with force until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers his legs.
And if the medicine forces him thus, let him keep it as long as he can; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you use this clyster in cases of diarrhea and the evacuation bothers him, then you repeat the clyster until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin and delicate, like those with which infants are clystered.
Concerning the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division on wound treatment what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus the treatment of those wounds with hand and with medicines according to their nature.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what causes the wounds and according to the location where the wounds occur.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are such as a stone throw, or incision by a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a club, or with an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the wounds that are in the various locations of the body are such as a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the chest, and similar to those of other limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of certain wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or similar, and only the skin is wounded, and it is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then immediately bleed him and do not delay; and extract blood from him according to his strength unless some cause prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has issued from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and from heavy foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his food be lessened, and let him not approach meat nor wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a pledget soaked in plain rose oil or in wine in which something styptic has been dissolved.
But if it is certain that there is a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent, its own blood and the powder which I shall shortly describe, if the air has not changed it.
And if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from a sword cut or similar, and its lips are not joined together by themselves, then join them with sutures according to what I shall describe concerning sutures.
But if the wound has already laid bare the bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it but a little suspension, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh properly in place of the bone, and order the patient to be fed on foods which contain thickness: heads and strong broths and the like, until it is composed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood can occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you should investigate the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you that what we have said does not suffice, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; thus you should dust these with this powder, for it consolidates them before the air changes them.
And the manner of the powder is this: take oil of roses one part, dragon's blood two parts, unquenched lime three parts; let all be well ground and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with powders and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, that it is not festering, for the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes this alone suffices, when you do not have roses and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be placed on them and they are fresh, and recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in summer time, then this powder is not intended for application, but rather treat those with what we have said,  so that you apply to them some digestive ointments, or that you apply to them powders of barley flour with water and honey until they purge the pus; and then treat them with the other cure until they are healed.
But if a fracture in a bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with tweezers.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are incised, then if it is a nerve, there is no other way than to avoid treating it with something that causes strong stypticity, such as vitriol and things similar to it, because it harms the nerves and contracts them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with light medicines, such as being washed with sweet water, sometimes infused with rose oil or non-rose oil, and  honey when washed with sweet water and other healing ointments according to this manner, and moist unguents.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or draw together its lips, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or an abscess forms in the lowest part of it, then perforate it in the most depressed place.
But if an artery has already been incised in the wound and a flow of blood results, then separate or cut it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if you have already incised the vertebrae of the throat or all, and the veins of the neck are saved, then you adjust the edges of the wound with sutures over the neck's bone and do not touch that; first equalize it and restore it to its natural shape, and then tighten it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments which have astringent and stimulating properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has caused damage to the bone, then clean it, and then if there are bone fragments in it, extract all those that you can; and what you are not able to remove, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the damaged area is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle on it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that of which the recollection will come later in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a rush of air from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you apply powder to it in the first hour, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply an attractive ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then you place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out the humidity; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is contained therein may flow out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it has not caused the patient spasms or tremors or a bad heart or stricture of the throat, and you see his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from an incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it as previously described for suturing, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has caused damage to the bone, and pieces have been detached, then you cleanse the wound and attempt to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound becomes suppurative, so that their extraction is easier.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the treatment is similar to what we have described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The indisposition which occurs in the abdomen is either great, or small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, insomuch that their reduction is more difficult if you don't take care of their replacement immediately, because it opens and swells, making its introduction difficult.
Therefore, the best rupture is moderate, because in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is according to four methods, but two sutures are common that are also suitable for sutures of other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures peculiar to the abdomen are also used for other wounds, but however, they are more proper in the suturing of the abdomen.
And I recount to you each one with explanation and clarification.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has emerged through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil in water with squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with this until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes it is done with a liquid that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
And so, when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the entry of it is relieved with little effort.
But if the re-entry is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which haemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate that there is no incision, and there is no need for drying and weakening.
Regarding the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the end is thin, and not with the thinness of a needle, rather it should be a little blunt.
And thus, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should follow its natural form, to its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is large, and is in the lower part of the belly, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should raise their head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the belly, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this treatment in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, apply what you have prepared, and then have your assistant, with gentle hands, hold the entire rupture with their hand and adjust its lips, and then prevent anything else from entering the suture.
And this is the common method of suturing:  first, take a needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then, leaving the width of an annular finger from the edge of the rupture,  thread the needle, ensuring that you do not knot the two ends of the thread, using two ends of a small piece of material (or a smaller thread) beneath the thread's ends, until you have passed it through that part; and you have now joined two ends of the thread and two ends of this small piece of material, making four points of attachment.
Then tighten with a double knot around the needle, sometimes from both sides together, and then approximate the two lips of the wound with a decent approximation; then leave the width of a finger and insert another needle into the wound, and tie this one with thread in the same way as the first needle; and continue doing this with needles as needed until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, for thin needles cut the flesh too easily; and thick ones are difficult to thread, therefore they should be of medium thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too deeply into the two ends of the thread, lest the flesh be too easily cut and the wound reopen before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be hindered from healing.
Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during their sleep; and place expanded powders over the suture on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave these in place until you know that the wound has healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient for small wounds, since one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient for their closure.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you stitch the four ends, two of the thread and two of the wound edges, at once, with a needle on which is wound thread of even thickness and fineness.
Then, when you have passed the needle through these four ends, withdraw the needle from the same side you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth seam with which cloths are sewn together.
And place between each stitch the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men. (or, And this is a suture known to men.)
And with such a suture I sewed up a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was more than a palm in length, and two palms of the intestine had come out from the middle of the wound, and the rupture was in the middle of the abdomen; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and moreover he lived for many years afterwards, and remained in good health.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle that he was, for I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where ointment was not suitable nor any medicine, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper according to the account of Paul (of Aegina, presumably).
And it is that you begin with the suture of the gut, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so when the needle penetrates the gut and that same laceration, both straight and along the length of the whole body, leave the end of the thread where you inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And then, when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again at that same end of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is at this point, and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside to the outside.
And make the penetration with that [needle] with which you make that penetration in the thread at the end of the wound which is on the side of him [the patient], until all of it penetrates.
And then begin from the same side and sew that with the end of the thread on the other side, and remove the needle from the gut which it penetrated, and then return it into that gut and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this end of the wound; and remove it from the gut which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once then another time until you sew all that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a purse-string suture with which you sew skins, so that you sew the thread once from the side of the end of the gut, and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second type of suture, which is properly called, and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which certain medics sew it, so that they join each part to its corresponding part conveniently by nature; and they apply the end of one to the other end of him, and the end of the wound to the other end of him, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you place the needle in the end of the wound nearest to you from the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that sole place, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside through the two ends of the thread.
And then turn them each, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part through two other ends of the wound that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, lighter suture, and it is the suture of which I previously made mention.
This is the speech/account of Galien (Galen).
And others say to me, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, that you introduce into each of these a thread, and begin with the introduction of the needle from the side that is toward you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you clean the fresh wound with its own blood before the air alters it, and reduce the intestine and sew it and dress it properly, then place incarnative powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some ointments which are at your disposal until they form a hard skin and the threads fall out, and are consolidated with cypress and myrrh; and then cure it in the same way as the cure of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then immediately place on it, as soon as it begins to throw off pus, old lint, and change that twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need other medication in many instances when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members, then you should submerge lion's wool in good quality soaked oil, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the armpits and under the arms.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in his intestines, because this often happens, then cauterize it with warm black styptic wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and an opening has been made penetrating into its cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine is easier to heal than one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not readily heal from a wound; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is the web (likely referring to a membrane or tissue), and you obtain that fresh, reduce it according to your usual method with which you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has passed into the space and has already turned green or black, then bind it with gall on the blackened area, so that a flow of blood may come, for there are veins and arteries in the web (membrane).
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the gall hanging down from the part below the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it towards the falling of the web and the emission of the pus from the wound may be relieved for you.
A reminder concerning wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, for this reason because I saw one who had been wounded in his belly by a lance blow and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had formed a fistula, and from it issued pus and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his recovery, but I continued to treat it subtly until it was healed and the area was consolidated.
And I, after I saw the area consolidated, feared for the patient that an accident might befall him in his belly; and no such accident happened to him, and he resumed his normal habits of eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and was exercised in his sayings [presumably referring to speech therapy or vocal exercises].
And some experienced [people] have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied according to this manner:  that you take ants with large heads; and then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, which has its mouth open, on the two lips of the wound; then when it bites onto them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and not be dissolved.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease to do this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.
And then reduce [the intestine] and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and let no harm befall the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with a fine thread which is made from the intestine of an animal, after it is threaded through a needle; and it is that you take the end of this intestinal thread, and it should be very clean [de-fleshed], and then tie its end to the thread of itself, wrapped [around the intestine], and then thread that thread into needles and sew with it the intestine, and reduce it into the disruption [the damaged area].
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, because then it is only a reduction [of the protrusion], and not a complete healing of it.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas and ulcers.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whichever member it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we also call it a *zuchem* (or *zychem*, the meaning is uncertain and may require deeper historical context).
And a fistula, truthfully, is a hardened,  white, knotted swelling, without pain, and which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and for this reason it is called a knotted ulcer, that is, a claw.
And in some men it is moist, which discharges pus; and very quickly the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes it is thin, and sometimes it is coarse, and sometimes it is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their cure with medicines, in the division (of the text).
And it is necessary that I make known to you the treatment of fistula, which is done by means of surgery with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those which cause damage near the principal member and similarly.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is among the diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is laborious and requires knowledge.
And if there is any of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and you wish to ascertain its extent, then take a probe of lead or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for its end with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent and follows the tortuous path.
And if the fistula has many winding passages, it is not possible for you to determine its extent with a probe.
Then, inject a clyster into the opening(s), because the liquid by which you inject it will go through the other openings and cleanse them.
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way possible, to know if there are bones or nerves present, and whether the depth of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a fistula with many openings, and consider all this with the utmost of your strength, with your questioning, by which you question the patient, and by the identification of pain through your compression with your hand over the area, and similar indications and accidental causes of the abscess.
And when you have considered all these causes with true judgment, then proceed to treatment with confidence:  that is, consider then whether the fistula is superficial and near, or in a healthy place, far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have mentioned to you.
Then you dry the fistula as described before, and remove what is in it of corrupted matter and flesh, and that which has grown in the opening, of flesh or skin or the like, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then you must incise it as deeply as possible, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you must investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit it because of some vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again, and meticulously perform the scraping and cleansing of it with your utmost strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that that corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which you have not reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to remove it, then you remove it with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many pieces of bone, then meticulously remove all of them, and do not leave any behind with your best effort.
But if some matter of humidity opposes you, and there is no fear or error in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not ready to remove the bones at this time, then apply something to the wound that will cause it to suppurate, and leave it until that reaches the area around those bones, flesh, and ligaments, and watch the wound so that it does not heal, and keep constricted the incision that you made in your operation.
Then, if you are afraid, place on it a cloth soaked in crushed rue with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in one of the green ointments; for when those ligaments suppurate, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is easier.
But if it is a large bone, such as the bone of the leg or thigh, or similar to those, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape that with a rasp only on the surface until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and incise all the way to where the corruption has reached, and then treat that until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and help in your operation.
There was a man young in age, around thirty years, who suffered pain in his thigh, and the internal parts swelled with matter inside the body until the matter reached the thigh, and it was the matter of an abscess, a large abscess, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time was extended with that because of the error of the physicians until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it, and its healing was delayed until the leg was fistulated, and many orifices were made in it, all of which discharged pus and the body's humors.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wisdom in them but in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those orifices in great quantity; and already the body of that man was all weakened and his color was jaundiced.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I examined all the orifices and found them to extend to all parts of the leg.
And then I considered and incised one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already earthy and corrupt and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted as far as the marrow.
And then I sawed away what was exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I thought that in the bone there was only that corruption which I excised and sawed, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, and it is not consolidated.
And then I again iterated and uncovered the bone a second time, over the first uncovering, and found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed away what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was perforated making his cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then I uncovered him again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, particularly, and forcibly [tried to] restore him, and it was not restored until I incised about a palm's breadth of it, and that I extracted with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it is lightly consolidated and healed.
And further iteration in the operation on him and section of him is not necessary except for the disposition of his frailty and for the smallness of his tolerance and his fear of death, for he suffered fainting spells at all hours due to excessive evacuation.
And therefore he is healed by a complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone flesh; and his disposition in his body is made good and his strength returned; and he is converted to his dispositions and suffered no impediment in walking nor harm in any way.
But if there is a prominent bone in the place of the flesh already removed, then you must saw that off in this manner:  that you take a ligature and bind it tightly around the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend it upwards; and place that woolen ligature thicker than the first ligature; and then bind that above the flesh that is below the bone, and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh above the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place wood or a board decently under the bone, for when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done on the corrupt place little by little, for if corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its outward appearance to the senses, then force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupt and not prominent, but one part is continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in part of it, then you uncover the flesh from all parts completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupt joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason for it except engineering (or ingenuity/skill).
And if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must inquire into the corruption in whatever way appears to you, and you must open it, and clean it according to any disposition which is possible for you, and with every tool, let it be rectified for you, when it does not harm you in vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws for incising these bones are many according to the placement of the bones, and the preparation of them, and the thickness of them, and the subtlety and the size and the smallness of them, and the hardness and their rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient to that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument of which you are in need; because with you there is great study and long and extensive knowledge of the ways of this art, and testimony of the ways of illnesses, for then you already have for yourself that which is convenient in the way of instruments for every illness.
And I am providing you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments which you will place as examples with which you will proceed to your prohibition which you will test on the others.  (The "prohibition" likely refers to a surgical procedure or treatment.) Shape/Type of saw:
Shape/Type of another saw:
Shape/Type of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or spoke): Let the head of this ray be according to the shape of a star-shaped key head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a [presumably, a type of pointed tool or implement - perhaps a star-shaped punch or awl].
And it is only suitable that with this [tool/instrument] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the opening is very wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a wide razor (or perhaps "flat" razor, depending on the intended meaning of "lat").
Shape of another saw, decently made: let its arc be as high as possible and its sharpness of iron, and its member of pointed wood decently made. Its shape/form/appearance:
The shape of a razor which has a concavity.
Shape of another, subtle razor.
The shape of another razor with a curved end.
The shape of a small razor resembling a probe.
The shape of another, smaller incisor.
The shape of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in the treatment of bones.
The shape of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of those who have perforated bones.
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have mentioned about razors, and incisors, and saws [be made of this material].
Concerning the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Extremities may become diseased either by an intrinsic or extrinsic cause, and if you have treated that corruption with remedies and the treatment is ineffective, or you see the corruption spreading through the limb without being caused by anything, then you must incise that limb up to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may escape from death or a greater harm resulting from the limb's deterioration.
And the sign of this happening is that the limb turns black as if fire has already burned it, or the blackness spreads until the decay reaches the limb, affecting it and spreading throughout the body; therefore, treat it with an incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the impact of some poisonous thing, such as a sea scorpion, viper, or shrew, and similar creatures.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then you should incise the finger and not give space to the corruption so that it may spread to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you should incise it from the base of the palm, and not allow the corruption to spread so that it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient; and to administer anything else beyond that in treatment is a waste of effort.
And similarly with the foot: when corruption affects a toe, then you should incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the instep of the foot, then you incise the whole foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is nothing for him but dismissal, and to leave the patient to death.
And the manner of incising a limb or cauterizing it is that you tighten a ligature on the part below that which you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the area; and let an assistant extend a ligature to the parts below, and let another assistant extend a ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, spreading it out until all the flesh is uncovered; and then let it be incised or cauterized.
And it is necessary that linen cloths be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient experiences a properly adjusted lesion and a hot abscess.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while operating, then you should carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some blood-stanching powders to it; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot with a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption initially occurred in his toe until it spread to the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, because he saw the cure going to the limb with such vehemence that he felt great pain and burning, and he himself incised that foot up to the joint, and it was healed.
For a long time, he suffered that same corruption in the index finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that excess with what I applied to his hand in terms of medicine, namely the purification of his body; and the excess was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it reached the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do so, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and even more so because I feared death from the incision of his hand, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and it came to my attention that that man prepared himself and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And this narrative is not added except to be helpful in understanding this illness, and to be a sign by which it can be recognized and according to which it should be treated.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clysterization (enema) with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin that is over it is thin like a fine cloth, and it has not reached further corruption, and it does not penetrate to the bone or to the nerves or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption penetrates any member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its treatment is to incise that skin entirely as it is swollen, and especially when it is thinned and made like a cloth, and make sure it does not adhere to the place through its corruption.
But if you fear that the skin will adhere and that that corruption has not reached further consequence, and the skin has some thickness, then you treat that with a clyster (enema).
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the arm that is there has a foul odor, then clysterize that with an Egyptian medicine which is of oil and sharp wine and resin, taking equal parts, and let them be mixed in a vessel, and let them be cooked over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then you take what is necessary from it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with this, and compress its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
And then extract that with a syringe; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is that you take the ashes of vines, and put water over them; and then strain that and clysterize with it until you are confident that the sinus is then clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey and to which crushed resin is mixed, and clysterize that with wine and honey mixed, for the property of honey is to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, and especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are confident that the sinus is now clean, then clysterize it with something that causes the flesh to grow there.
And it is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you clysterize it with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise of ointments.
And if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that the nozzle of the clyster is not received, then you should widen it little by little with a small iron instrument, and place in it a tent wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the orifice is wide, then you should approximate its lips with sutures and leave a sufficient opening for the clyster to enter without addition.
And if the orifice from which the pus flows is situated higher up, then dry it in the lowest part of it so that the pus flows downwards, for when the pus is trapped in the depth of the sinus, flesh will not be generated there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus down to the lowest bone as you wish, then strive to prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus flows lightly as it is convenient for you and so that no pus is retained there.
But the one over the orifice of the sinus, you should change that every hour so that what is collected there of the pus comes out. And so that you know if what flows from the pus is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, you should examine the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter expelled at the opening of the sinus is already adhering, or tends to adhere, then loosen it the next day, or the third day; and when you loosen the dressing, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus a subtle poison spreads nearby, then do not be surprised by its adhesion, for its healing is approaching; because there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and others in whom the opposite occurs.
And if undigested pus has issued from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust to drying medications; and if the medications are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry like diafinicon ointment, when the superfluous addition of zegi is adjusted to it.
And the best remedy with which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and add old, well-aged wine to it, equal in its substance, and mix this well together and use it.
And it resembles that action, when there is no pus, diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use it; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind everything and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire, then apply this on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and apply it with the honey that you have cooked until thickened, and powder it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes aristolochia longa and roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and flour of barley and centaurea are administered with it, and use these simples or mixed; grind those, sift them, and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in its depth, and it has already inquired into the bones or other hard parts or ligaments; then you treat it with fistula treatment, as described above.
Concerning the treatment of paronychia, and of injured nails, and of added finger incisions, and of sectioning.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger or toe of the hand or foot, and easily arises in other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less valued, or is abscessed from a hot abscess, or is corrupt, and throws out pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and easily corrupts the whole of it, and easily its corruption penetrates to the bone until there is a foul odor to it, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
And therefore when you have this with what we have said in the division and do not succeed in your treatment, then it is necessary that you incise with iron all the superfluity that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound near to it, for a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, once empty, already compress the flesh at the inner parts, and begin to prick and hurt it, then it is necessary that you place a fine thread under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and lift it up and incise that flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh corrosive medicines until it is all consumed; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption already penetrates the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for a bone which is corrupt is never healed.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption going into the finger, then you incise it at one of the joints, as its treatment is prescribed, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers from a blow or friction, and there is vehement pain in it, then you must first bleed the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse cut from above downwards, and take care that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause the patient vehement pain, and it will be the cause of the growth of superfluous flesh in that place; and then treat that place with what reduces pain.
But a finger, which is born in the hands of some men, is very quickly fleshy all over, and very quickly has bones, or very quickly has nails.
And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their growth is in some of the joints of the fingers. But that which is born in some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is very quickly painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the section is easy, and it is that you should incise that one below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the joints, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then treat that until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their knuckles, either by the birth of a man born thus, or by consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you sever that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as necessary.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you cut that consolidation according to how it is formed and suitable to the shape of the limb.
Of incisions of vices, there are various kinds.
Vices are various, and they are swollen, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and most often in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and burden-bearers.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
But the treatment of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be elevated and entirely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner:  first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, feculent blood is resolved from the leg. Then bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh down to below the knee with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision. Then elevate the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until the quantity of blood you desire and which seems sufficient is drawn out, and which will remove the patient's ailment.
Then bind it up, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But their elevation is according to this manner: you who shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, and then put him in a bath and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are swollen; or, if a bath is not available to you, let him perform vigorous exercise until the limb is warmed.
Then incise the vein in the right place along the length of the vein, either behind the knee, or lower down behind the ankle.
Then open the vein with an instrument and scrape the vein on all sides until it bleeds, and it is from its appearance that you see this redness turning to blackness.
And then, when it has bled, from the vein you see that which is white, like a string.
Then you place a leech below it so that it is elevated and is drawn to the vein, and suspend it with a golden or silver hook.
Then make another incision near that incision three fingers' breadth away, and then scrape the vein from the part above the vein until it bleeds.
Then raise it and incise it in the rear section towards the heel, and then extract it and raise it until it comes out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until all is extracted; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you to extract and elevate it, then insert a double-ended strong thread needle and tie it and extract it, or insert a leech below it and move your hand around until it is drawn out. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to elevate it and it has become harmful to the patient because of that damage.
And when it is all expelled, then place on the wound site wool soaked in rose wine and un-rose-scented olive oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted, having tortuosity where there is a twisting in the parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you incise it along all its tortuous parts and at the places where it is twisted, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate the whole thing.
And beware during your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the intestine is cut:
It is not sharpened like hooks, nor is it of a sharp point so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of a thick, flexible nature, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein because of its thinness; therefore it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Ategi in Arabia, and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little humidity, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, scabies, and maggots are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of its coming is that in the leg a vehement inflammation occurs; and then the area is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one to two drachms, and tie it, leaving the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as something of it appears outwardly, wrap it in lead and tie it. And if the protrusion is prolonged, then you incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise its root until it has emerged, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh, causing an abscess and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is entirely expelled and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein, in some men, it has issued to a length of five palms and fingers, and it has even reached me that one issued of twenty palms. (Note:  A palm is an old unit of length, approximately 4 inches).
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then introduce a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long hole through the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then cure it by the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch issues from each orifice.
And therefore cure it in the way we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision (or cutting) above worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine sickness.
This illness is called in some lands among us bovine illness because it often happens to cattle, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and it goes throughout the body, rising and falling, and it is shown by the feeling of its movement from member to member until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and earthworms and ascarids happen in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it goes into the body and is raised to the head, and has reached the eye, then very quickly it enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
And therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is done only because of its movement and appearance to the senses, and then it is necessary that you tighten what is above it and what is below it with strong binding and constriction, and then dry it out and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you place a cautery with fire on the place until it dies, and the greatest cause that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then tighten above the eyebrow with a strong binding, and then dry it out, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of their body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard against foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the disease nafir (or a similar ailment).
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in certain limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have seen it as I shall tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the basilic vein of the arm, and after it had remained for an hour, I saw that swelling moving in the manner of a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than a worm, as if it were quicksilver running from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and remained there for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I realised that it was moving throughout her body as I had seen; and I was very astonished by its movement and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain moving from one limb to another. But I did not see it with my eyes as I did in the woman.
And I thought that this was so because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this case that wind-like movement was apparent to the senses.
And it is necessary that it does not appear, following this treatment, in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on that place lightly and dry it until that constricted wind-like ailment is expelled, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with rubbing of the body and with things that expel winds, and drive them away with foul-smelling pills and pills of scammony and similar things.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they lodge, for their diversity is such that there are those with large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and those that have three angles, and those that have barbs; and those that have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, when an arrow lodges there and pierces the bone, and emerges from the skull which is over the brain, for it causes sudden violent pain, and scotoma (blurred vision), and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile, and speech is quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and there emerges from the wound a white moisture similar to pus, and from it something like the watery substance of flesh.
And therefore, if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is already out.
But the signs of the arrow when it lodges in the heart, are that it is near the left nipple, and one feels as if it were fixed in something hard, and it is not in an empty space; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there follows coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death approaches without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are the emission of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are swollen, and the patient's color changes, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the intake of cold air.
And if the arrow lodges in the pleura, which is in the chest, the pain then is near the lower ribs, and great difficulty in breathing is caused with violent pain and sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow lodges in the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes from the wound.
And if the arrow lodges in the abdomen, and is fixed there, some of the wound will discharge pus, or intestinal tissue, or intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope of its cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow lodges in the bladder, and urine is expelled, and some matter proceeds from it to the external parts, and severe pain quickly comes upon the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the best dispositions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may thereby understand your own treatment.
Which is the reason that, in a man an arrow lodged in the tear duct of his eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side, below his ear, and he is healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which lodged in him in the corner of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden, and I found only a small point with which it adhered to its shaft; and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion head, which had no barbs.
And the Jew is healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and this is the kind that has barbs; and then I incised it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I carefully worked on it, and then I extracted it, and the Christian is healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and therefore, since thirty days had passed and no change had occurred in his condition, I incised over the arrow and extracted it, and he is healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound healed over him, and after about seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her belly, and the wound healed within her, and her condition did not change in any respect, and the woman found no impediment in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face, and the wound healed and the arrow broke, finding no great pain there, and many similar cases.
And I extracted the arrow from the king's prince's man which had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already declined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure, about three days after the arrow's lodging.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I investigated it with a thin probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a prickling under his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was from the tip of the arrow.
And I plastered the place with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut into it.
And no significant event happened in the area indicating that the arrow had reached that place; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no event happened; and the wound was consolidated meanwhile, and the patient desisted from its extraction for many days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with the probe I tested it, and found the thin point of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the application of the sharp medicine to the wound until the tip of the arrow appeared to me visibly, and I spent time doing this for a period of four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged, and it became possible for me to insert forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in doing so, then I did not cease to refine and devise methods on it, until one day I managed to grasp it with specially made forceps, as the shape of those will be shown at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound was consolidated, and the patient is healed with complete health, and he suffered no harm whatsoever.
And I recount to you the method of extraction of certain arrows so that you may apply this rule and meaning to that which has not been said, for the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended with narration, nor does this book contain them.
And skilled artisans compare the small with the great; and that which is present with that which is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments for the removal of foreign bodies from the art when it occurs.
Therefore I say that arrows are not expelled from the limbs into which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they are embedded; or by pushing from the opposite side.
And that which is expelled from the place where it entered, is an arrow that has penetrated a fleshy place, and it is pulled and expelled.
And if it does not yield to extraction at the time of the injury, then you should leave it for a few days until the flesh surrounding it softens, and its extraction and removal are eased.
Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to extraction, then leave it for a few days and repeat the attempt at extraction and movement each day, and it will eventually be expelled.
And if it still does not yield to extraction after a few days, then you must perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a thin drill until the area around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and is beyond feeling, then you should search for it with a probe; and if you feel it, then extract it with instruments suitable for its removal.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the projectile, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should enlarge the wound so that it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is held by barbs, then you should free the flesh in which it is embedded from all sides with all the skill you can muster; and work on this, if you cannot manage the removal of the flesh by breaking off the barbs and twisting them until they yield.
And when you undertake the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting motions of your hand with forceps in all directions until it yields; and proceed with utmost delicacy so that the arrow is not broken and its extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then try again, for it will then be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then administer the treatment we have described in its chapter.
And be careful about cutting a vein or nerve, or tendon, and use all possible skill to remove the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore, counteract the arrow so that the patient is positioned according to the figure showing the arrow's placement, for this is more helpful. But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the figures (illustrations).
But if the arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part is already projecting outwards, or if the tip of the arrow causes swelling at the end of the deep wound, sometimes even protruding; then you should cut above it; and the incision should be as large as the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will then be easily removed.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead is embedded in the bone, and widen it yourself, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is in it, then push it through with him/it (referring to the shaft or a tool).
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to administer pressure, then insert, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that its concavity fits into the tail of the arrow and then push it through.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then you push it through with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrowhead is thereby relieved.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow falls into the foot, or into the belly, or into the bladder, or into the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then dress the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let their ends be like a bird's beak, which are made like a saw when they grasp the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and the tightness of it.
like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased and is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins which are in the two apparent temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes which are called *aspicientz*; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose; and two veins which are at the neck; and two veins which are in the upper lip; and two veins which are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins which are called *algelic* —; and there are two veins which are under the tongue. But the veins which are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these there is one cephalic, and it is located on the wild side; and the people call it "the vein of the head", and it is deep, and it is a middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people name that one "vein of the whole body", and the basilic is a vein which is located on the inner side of the arm, and it is called "citillar", and the common people name that one "vein of the belly"; and the *funis* of the arm, and it is located on the forearm, and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and *salvatella*, and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is that which is below the bend of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the outer side; and in the leg there are other veins similar to these.
The benefit of opening the veins near the ears is for chronic catarrh, migraine, *sahafati* (a term needing further investigation for accurate translation), and old, bad head ulcers.
And the method of bleeding those veins is as I recommend to you:  that the head of the patient be raised, and the patient's head be rubbed at the occiput in the area of both veins with a wide cloth, with good friction; then the patient should tighten their neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed areas of the head; and feel for them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, then bleed them with a lancet.
Then you take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and you insert it under the vein in the incision until the blood flows out. Then raise your hand with the vein and the incision to the upper parts and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers placed together, or thereabouts; and let blood flow out as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And I have already described at the beginning of the book the incision of these and their cauterization.
But of the two arterial veins that are in the temples, bloodletting is beneficial for chronic and sudden severe migraine, persistent ophthalmia, and a flow of acute superfluities effused into the eyes.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on these is as I have recounted to you:  constrict the patient's neck tightly until the two veins appear palpable by clear manifestation and their pulse is felt beneath your finger; and then you bleed with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein at the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards; and incise it just as you did the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the constriction on the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then apply a bandage and powders to it, and bind it tightly above with a strong constriction, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the recollection of them, and of their incision, and the drawing [of blood] has been preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is comparable to phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient diseases of the face, and for migraine, and redness, and fetid ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I recounted to you; that is, that the patient should constrict his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a fossorium, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossorium upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or with some other thing in the manner of it, and let the blood flow according to the quantity which you wish; and then loosen the perforation of the patient and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of acute extremity like the other phlebotomies, rather it should be of blunt extremity, and perform the phlebotomy across, because the bone is near and would easily break there if the phlebotomy were subtle [i.e., finely pointed].
But the benefit of the two veins which are at the lacrimal ducts of the two eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient should constrict his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across rather than lengthwise, a little with a small phlebotomy tool, because in that place there is not much flesh; and if the phlebotomy tool is sharp, its point will be broken very easily.
And then let blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton over it, and bind it for a night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and violent headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and redness that happens in the face, and especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient should constrict his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin phlebotomy tool and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge in a straight line, because the vein is not apparent to the touch here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
See that you move your hand with the small phlebotomy tool little by little and let blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, because it is lightly restored.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the two jugular veins is for the constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy and many diseases and impetigo and bad corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those (veins) is that the patient should tighten under each one on his neck with a bandage; and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a stool.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy tool little by little; and then extract blood according to a moderate quantity or according to what the necessity of the situation requires; and then do likewise with the other vein.
And then untie the bandage and tighten the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the alveolar veins is good for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and for bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those (veins) is that you make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage, and then roll up his lips and look for two veins, of which one is to the right of the lip and the second to the left; and the indication of each is by the blackness of each of the two, and this is more so because in the area of those there are small, black veins; and then incise each one with a cutting incision.
But if you are in doubt, and you do not know which of those (veins) it is, then you should make an incision in the larger of those, and in the most apparent of those.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are under the tongue, the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is more beneficial for affections that are in the throat, for disease of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and elevate his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side of it is a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to overuse your hand in phlebotomizing these, because under these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the neck are those which are present in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways; either one punctures with a myrtle- or olive-shaped fleam of a thinning point; or one cuts with a lancet-shaped fleam, and it is called incision, and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, apparently large veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this fleam is of lesser width and of a more subtle point, and is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins that contain thin, citrine blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilica vein, which is one of three veins: because it draws out blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from those that affect the feet and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he carefully guards this and be very careful in this, because beneath it is an artery, and if he errs and is inaccurate in the puncture of the fleam, he will incise that artery and cause a flow of blood, so that it is necessary that he not phlebotomize this with a sharp fleam, rather it should be cut with a lancet.
And if the basilica vein does not appear manifestly, then it is necessary that you leave that one and that you move to another, or that you seek some branch of it; or that you phlebotomize in its place at the end of the arm, for that is manifest; and incise that with a lancet-fleam as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before the constriction of the arm you should touch the area until you know the location of the pulse, and then mark it with ink; and then tie the arm and incise the vein with a concave incision with a lancet-fleam as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall within the space of the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the place that you have marked with ink, then that inflation is inflation of the artery, and therefore avoid that.
And if you see the blood flowing in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is blood from the artery; and then you observe and place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood is interrupted, for many times it is interrupted, then you tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch the patient for their mucus, and be mindful of them and do not harm them for some days until they are healed.
But if the blood is not interrupted, and you see that you do not have a remedy for this, then you incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the blood is interrupted; or that you take the bark of a fig tree, and dry it, and take one half and bind it over the area of the vein with a descending constriction with a ligature and with powders until the next day.
And then if the blood is interrupted, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which was previously mentioned in the recollection of the place with the powders that interrupt the flow of blood.
And the interruption of their blood is difficult in many conditions because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of ligating the arm.
But from the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful to draw blood from the superior part of the head and the inferior part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist to be very careful in the phlebotomy of this, because below it is a nerve; and if he errs in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, stupor will occur to him, and its healing is difficult, and perhaps it will never be completely healed. And this nerve is often visible; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you use the phlebotomy with which you perform phlebotomy with a slanted incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should open the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with diseases of the eyes.
And it is proper in this case, if you want the phlebotomist to puncture with an olive-shaped phlebotomy tool or a myrtle-shaped phlebotomy tool; because it is the safest of all veins, for neither artery nor nerve lies beneath it.
However, it is very quickly inflamed in some men, when it is not phlebotomized at the first puncture, but that inflammation does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and caution against the onset of diseases, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or on the first, after three hours have passed since the day.
But phlebotomy is administered when it provokes convenience and necessity for it, whether by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child should not be phlebotomized until he is fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and old women who are over sixty years old should not be phlebotomized.
And if anyone wishes to be phlebotomized in any manner whatsoever, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a clyster of honey, if he has much retained excrement in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the bowels into the phlebotomy, which are putrid, and that they may not harm the principal members.
And let not patients be phlebotomized who have nausea,  fever, or diarrhea, nor those recovering from illness or fever until these things have subsided, nor those suffering from dropsy; and furthermore, let phlebotomy be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and during excessive sexual intercourse, labor, exercise, fasting, or vigils, and in any circumstance that weakens vital force, whether bodily or animal.
And consider carefully beforehand, concerning the thinning of humors, if the blood is thick, with food and drink, and with medicines, if this is possible for him.
And let him enter a bath, if no cause forbids it, or let him be exercised by some activity so that the blood may be thinned.
And perform his phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And perhaps you should ensure that the patient's feet are guarded on that day from all harmful accidents, both animal, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and from all bodily accidents, such as excessive labor and exertion, sexual intercourse, and the like.
And at his bedside, let there be present things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and fragrances and with balms and things similar to them, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, let the phlebotomist extend his arm and rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is not equal, or the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the blood from flowing out.
And near the constriction, it is necessary that the one who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then let the phlebotomist anoint his fleam with a little old oil; and then place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly, and the percussion is stopped because some veins are like cords that flee from the phlebotomy; and those that are full of wind, when you place the fleam on them, contract to avoid the phlebotomy and then the phlebotomist is unsuccessful; and the fleam does not open the vein, and if it opens, it is constricted.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive to all these details.
Then apply the fleam; but if the vein is opened on the first attempt, that is good; otherwise, repeat the process a little below or above that spot with haste, if the area is not inflamed.
And if the area is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will quickly draw a hot abscess, nor should they enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that you will not obtain the desired quantity of blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in that same incision, straightening and slightly enlarging the opening, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, because in many men the area becomes inflamed with even a small opening.
But if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure there, for it will not help; and apply some crushed olive leaves to the area, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer crushed olive leaves in all phlebotomies with which you open veins to prevent blood clotting;  and use theriac and sagapenum (when applied to the area) to do this, because they thin the blood and break up clots when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the phlebotomy—which happens often, especially in someone who has been bled only once or where the vein opening was small—then take a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water, and apply it tightly to the area for an hour, for this will dissolve it.
And it is necessary to do this immediately after the bleeding from that vein is complete, or from another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains at the site for a few days, do not worry; and if you wish, apply something made of dissolved aloes and myrrh, or something made from mint juice, or calamint, or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings often occur after phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Then place your hand on it, and if you find softness under your compression, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then be careful not to apply anything of what we have said, because blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the area is hardened, and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract blood from everyone according to the quantity of their strength and according to the dominant color of the blood as it appears.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong and needs bloodletting, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in someone who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to extract blood in several times, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy is that the incision be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safe from excessive bleeding and the incision of nerves, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to latitude and longitude (i.e., a lengthwise cut).
And to whom syncope is accustomed to happen after phlebotomy, it is necessary that you cure that before phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or simple warmed oxymel; and extract the blood in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in an aromatized and very fragrant syrup.
And if syncope happens after phlebotomy, and the cause of it is the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that he take to drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatherapy with rosewater, and let his feet be bathed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope caused by evacuation (of fluids).
And whoever wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is for the purpose of evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to the quantity of strength on continuous days.
But whoever wants to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do this after seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body contrary to the part to which it declines (i.e., to a different part of the body), it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and it is sharp and causes fever to increase, it is necessary that blood be drawn from it at once, and that a large quantity be drawn, and that the opening be widened until syncope occurs, provided that you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse below the flow of blood, so that death does not result instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary, when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, since the opening of the vein is already closed and the blood's exit is made difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and that it be bent slightly extended, for this is very bad.
Having left it, let it be bled a second time; or remove this with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument that is coagulated blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac alfarach, or some sage, and compress it with light pressure until the blood has come out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is settled (healed).
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed it in that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized in place of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of those (veins).
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient should put his hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears manifestly.
And then it should be bound there with a bandage with moderate tightness; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal (vein), not laterally nor lengthwise.
And let the incision be wide, and let your phlebotomy, with which you phlebotomize, be above the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited (stopped), then you return the hand to the warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your need (desired amount).
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from returning the hand to the warm water, and the same is prescribed for placing the blood bowl in warm water in winter time.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all the other veins, because beneath it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerves.
And phlebotomy of the little vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you constrict the arm with a ligature or with your hand, after you have put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you incise it completely, that will not harm in any way.
And be careful not to extend your incision too far in the phlebotomy, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
And then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow will be impeded.
And when the blood has been extracted according to the amount needed, then you place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly consolidated; and similarly, you should do this in every tight branch.
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is helpful for diseases of the spleen.
And perform the phlebotomy on him similarly to how you performed it on the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, and menstrual retention, and for illnesses of old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the manner of phlebotomy on him is that the patient should put his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear well; and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein that you should puncture is apparent below the big toe, and from that, many branches are ramified on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg near the heel, because it is better and healthier.
And if you phlebotomize that one on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize across, as if you were to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the outflow of blood is prohibited; then you immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the location is safe; and do not fear to harm him, but beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And of the sciatic vein, the location as we have said is below the heel, under the ankle bone of the left side.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly bind his thigh from the hip to above the ankle above four fingers with a long, thin bandage, for it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse vein, and that is better; or incise it by incision or cut it by section, for its location is safe.
And it is in many men very hidden; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow in the quantity you desire.
And then loosen the ligature and place a cotton pad on the site of the phlebotomy and bind the place tightly, for it heals easily.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cups are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cups that are administered with scarification and bloodletting, there are fourteen places on the body, of which one, where cups are placed, is the occiput, and that is the back part of the head; and the middle place on either side of the neck together; and cups on the chin below the jaw, below the mouth; and cups on the two shoulder blades; and cups on the hollow of the elbow (or armpit); and cups on the two thighs; and cups on the two ankles; and cups on the two hips.
And cupping does not draw blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish strength as it does in phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping because of illness or a continuing condition, administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when you see any of these conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we order that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied, it relieves the heaviness in the head and that which affects the eyes; but this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted to use it on someone with a cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And therefore, it is not advisable to use this on the elderly, and those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
But to the one on whom this is continuously applied, forgetfulness is caused; and therefore, you must instruct the cupper to place his hand lightly near the cupping device below, to prevent the onset of forgetfulness.
But cupping with alkehel (likely a specific type of cupping or substance used in cupping) is in the place of phlebotomy of the dark vein and the basilic vein: and therefore it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the throat, and the tearing of the throat, and cough, and repletion (likely referring to congestion or fullness).
And it is necessary that the alkehel cupping be applied gently, for if it is placed too forcefully, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping with alhagdahan (likely another specific substance or technique) benefits accidental pains in the head, ophthalmia (eye inflammation), migraine, suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand during scarification lest he injure the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar diseases of the mouth, and stands in place of phlebotomy of the arteries that are in the two lips.
But cupping that is done on the two shoulder blades benefits against caphatan (a condition or disease, the nature of which is unknown from this context), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two inner parts of the ankles benefits similarly to phlebotomy of three veins, that is, the basilic, median cubital (fusca - likely a translation variant or regional name), and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply in scarification, because the area is sparsely fleshed, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass with which one cups over the buttocks and it benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that it should be a large cupping glass, and that it be of brass, because the area requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses are quickly torn and should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs is gentler for evident depletion, for it draws blood from the whole body, and it benefits old pains of the joints and of the womb (uterus), and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and benefits boils and swellings; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two femoral veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause syncope in many men.
And of the cupping of the femoral veins, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cupping of the two legs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw by moderate suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, and allow the humors to come to the place by equal distribution. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the appearance of the redness of blood.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and consider the disposition of the body.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to enlarge the scarification and to make it a little deeper, and temper the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and to its watery part. But in the second [scarification], to the scrutiny acquired from the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that it achieves the desired result.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is sufficient for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the term scarification in which there is the depth of the elbow only.  (This likely refers to the depth of the cut, using the elbow as a reference point for depth, not an actual cut at the elbow.)
And if the one whose elbow is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places for the cupping glasses be anointed with lenitive, aperitive, and resolvent ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then let the oil be amaranth oil, or balsamita oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
But if the patient has wide pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be prohibited, and for such a person the areas for cupping should be washed with vinegar or cold water of solanum, or with poppy water, or with bordelages water, and similar ones.
And the one whose blood is of much humidity, wash his cupping areas with sharp vinegar, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar ones.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash his cupping areas with old wine, or with water of sanquis (possibly a type of herb, perhaps synonymous with majorana/marjoram), or with a decoction of anise, or of chamomile, and similar ones.
And the cupping should be performed before a bath; rather, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and he should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that the person to be cupped or bled should do before cupping?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning:  if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp blood and inflammation, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, and endive in sharp vinegar and lettuce, and chickpea flour (or a chickpea-based preparation), and julep, and similar things.
And give him foods such as chicken, and meats of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with sour things, and the like.
And for one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of chickpea flour and sumac, and very fragrant wine drunk between autumn and winter; and he should be advised to eat and drink sparingly, and give him foods such as chicken, hempseed,  peas, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting, his drink should be greater than his food.
And it is necessary that at certain times some men be given theriac alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or celadine before cupping or before bloodletting or afterwards, so that the principal members are comforted and the blood is thinned; and they should not take those things heated.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be cuppings that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the knees, and the bladder region, for these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not desired for these [cuppings] except the attraction of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in a disease of nasal bleeding; and we use it so that cold, invisible windiness is dissolved from the member, just as we place it on the belly and navel; for it rarifies the member and warms it and relieves the pain because it resolves windiness.
And it is placed on boils when they occur with obstruction or inflammation, for by the virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the inflammation from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of windiness enclosed in them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction alone; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in diseases of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been cooked.
Method of administering a cupping glass with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, as we have formed it; and let the length of the cupping glass be half a palm; and let it be on the side of him, in the place that is in the circumference, half of it, let the hole be small according to the quantity that an awl enters it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or citrus [wood?], with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb by its placement upon it.
And let there be a transverse bar of bronze or iron in the middle of it, where a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for young people and those of large bodies.
And the method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the wick with a decent wood fire before a small wax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the lower part, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it is placed on the patient's limb, and the finger is placed over the hole we mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and let the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass is immediately dissolved (i.e., the suction released).
And then ignite the wick according to its manner, and repeat this if you need to.
But in cupping that is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb alone.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leech's are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs in which the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their smallness, such as the finger and gums and similar things; or on a limb devoid of flesh, such as the finger and nose and things like them.
And the quality of using those leeches is that you should find leeches that are in clean fresh waters free of putrefaction.
And then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no substance remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and with cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then they should be placed upon it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is even more beneficial.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with warm water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the application of the leeches, and it weeps (or oozes), then you dip a linen cloth in cold water, and place that on top until the weeping stops.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle on it crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, until the bleeding is stopped; or place halved, scorched beans on the area and leave them there until the beans stick to the area, and the bleeding is stopped.
And it is necessary, if needed, to reapply leeches, when it is possible to change those (already applied).
And if leeches are prohibited or unavailable, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood comes out; and then apply (leeches), for they readily attach themselves when they sense any blood.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish physicians and commoners boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter of them.
And for this reason, this practice is kept private by the learned in our land; and I have never forgotten this in any way; and I have not applied this which I have learned except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study on their understanding, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And then I applied it to experiment and study throughout the length of my life.
And I have described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and upon which my experience has been applied; since I have abbreviated it for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have abbreviated it to the point of brevity; and I have shown it to the point of clarity; and I have formed in it many forms of instruments that are administered in it, as is done by the addition of explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summary and collection of the essentials of bone fractures, those which must be prefaced before we begin the recollection of broken and diverse members, each one individually. Therefore, I will say in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters on the understanding of which the artisan is forced to stand at the beginning and on the truth of those; that is, you and those who are ready to learn or teach this noble art, others of you.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, then you should begin with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness of strength, or if the one to whom it happens is a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or if the time is one of intense heat or intense cold.
And then let him be content with a diet of cool herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit fatty meats and filling foods and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are certain of a hot abscess, and if you do not fear an effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to their former regimen, with which they are accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed with nutritious foods, very nourishing and thick and heavy, in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat boiled in water, and rice, and heads [possibly referring to specific cuts of meat], and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar things, and with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their first youth and in the decrepit, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and applies to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until it is completely conjoined and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until nothing prevents it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient foods in which there is heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the members, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other members are different from each other.
And I come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
Many diversities of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arched fracture, besides those that happen in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions proceeding and not proceeding, as is done in a quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type belongs its own specific treatment or torment in its restoration, as will be recalled distinctly in its proper place.
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is known: its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and that which we perceive when we grasp it with our hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is anything felt by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Perhaps there is a crookedness or small fissure; then you should not move it with your hand and with complete compression.  Rather, place on it some medicine, of which mention will be made later at the appropriate moment, which is suitable for the location; and then let it be held tightly by a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is curved and not split in two, or otherwise damaged in such a way that it has not lost its connection with its corresponding part, then you must begin at once to rectify it before an abscess develops there from the injury.
And if a hot abscess develops there, then leave it for some days until the abscess subsides; and then dress it according to whatever light and skillful method you can.
And know that the restoration and healing of [the injured area, understood from the context] is easier than of a bone in which a wound has occurred.
And then bind it as the later instructions will indicate.
But if the bone is injured, then extension of that broken limb is necessary from two sides, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand.
And let your position be such that you place the limb in a dressing that follows its natural shape, while the broken parts of the limb are extended; then you must carefully return those [displaced] parts to their places in whatever way you can.
And be careful, according to your strength, that you do not cause pain or injury to the patient through your operation; and carefully, according to your ability, apply one bone to its companion bone according to their best alignment.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch that [area] with your hand, and if you see anything amiss there, correct it and adjust it to the best of your ability.
And avoid excessive extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who often cause a hot abscess by their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen through their operations many times.
And the quality of the binding of the quieted limb is that which I have recounted; so that you may know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their largeness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the wrist and similar, then the wrapping should be of very fine soft cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, the wrapping should be broad and firm, because a broad bandage connects the large limb and holds it on all sides with even binding, so that no blemish enters it.
Then begin, after your equalization evacuation, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of the fracture with three or four wrappings according to what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come to the uppermost part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you bound the fracture site. And then extend yourself with the wrapping of the fracture site a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you take a large portion of the site.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a wrapping, and then come with the wrappings to the lower part of the fracture; and let your work be in the tightening of the wrapping and in softening it as we have said in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the wrappings some lion's wool or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then carefully apply well-made splints over these bandages immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the place, and then place on it what dries the abscess and removes the inflammation; and leave it for some days; and then you tighten the splints on it.
And let the splints be of half a cane, shaved and well-formed wisely; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be a little thicker and smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is suitable for the limb in size; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then tie it over with thread neatly as we have said of tightening, and it is so that your tightening is greater according to the place of the fracture, and the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the practice of some fools placing their threads of twisted rope, it is a great error, when the tightening is not even.
And similarly, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them what you want by tightening, and it is not necessary that there be less than one finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place under those some carded flax or wool so that it does not injure him.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the bone, and I will return to this in that chapter according to its particular nature.
And know that not every broken limb is immediately splinted on the first day; the reason is that, when the limb is large, you should not apply splints until approximately five or seven days or more, according to your assessment of the risk of a hot abscess forming.
And this is the method of the plasters with which the Ancients made restorations, which were applied to fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
A method of common plaster, a shortened version for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many complex situations and especially for women and children, because it is something that neither heat nor cold overcomes: it is to take some mill dust, which is the pith of flour that settles on the walls of the mill from the movement of the millstones.
And make it like this, except that you sift it with egg white, and make its consistency neither thick nor thin; and use it in this way.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of labdanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and wild pomegranate root, of each one dram (x); of myrrh and aloes, half a dram (v); of aloes wood, two drams (xx); all should be crushed, sifted, and mixed with aloe juice or egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores slightly broken bones, and is beneficial to many people.
Another method of plaster which helps fractures and sprains: take wild pomegranate root and marshmallow root, one dram (x); of myrrh and aloes, half a dram (v); of acacia, six drams (vi); of Armenian bole, two drams (xx).
All should be crushed in a mortar with much grinding, and sifted, and mixed with water or egg white and applied.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in them, and for fissures and fractures: take unwashed wool and submerge it in sour wine and boiled oil and apply it to the affected area.
But this plaster does not have restorative virtue; it rather draws out hot abscesses and expels pain.
Another method of plaster that restores a broken bone: take leaves of the wild fig and leaves of wild poppy; crush everything and make a plaster from them.
A shortened method of plaster administered for the restoration of bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers, oat flour, of all equal parts; all should be crushed and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix it with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method of plaster, stronger in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb: take roots of marshmallow and flaxseed, and pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all in equal parts; all should be crushed and mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration, but rather a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be of medium consistency, neither too thick nor too thin.
But in Wales it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the things which cause desiccation with a little heat, such as myrrh, incense, and similar things to those which we have mentioned.
Method for a plaster that relieves injury and pain: take millet, bran, shaved human hair or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt, in equal parts; they should be crushed and sifted and mixed, and a plaster should be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and when it should be loosened, is that you should consider whether pain or itching has occurred, or if the bone is broken or dislocated; then you should not unbind it for many days. And if vehement pain, itching, or inflammation occurs at the site, then you should carefully loosen or remove it at that time, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a moist sea sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water, and with it wash the area until the itching ceases and the pain is soothed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place over it clean wool soaked in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb has subsided, and its pain is eased.
And then repeat that subtle binding and small plaster, and do not tighten it as much as your first constriction, but subtly with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely subsided, and you need a plaster and binding, then you should repeat it as you did in the beginning, equally.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not loosen it until after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you upon loosening the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh over it.
And then adjust the binding more than in your first binding, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as his recovery proceeds.
But if you see the fracture site drying out and becoming thinner than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it; and do this every three days; and loosen the binding a little, and by this operation, nourishment will return to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not properly set initially, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their practice, and a great risk, and if it were straightforward, the Ancients would have magnified this in their books and would have operated with this.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable that you do not do this.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the blow breaks the entire bone into splinters, which are below the bone, just as it does in a stick, and for that reason this type is called *ascial* (axial?); or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its flesh and does not penetrate to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta* (complete elevation?).
And the wound from these two fractures is either large or small, and there is fracture which is comminution or attrition; and its cause is a blow with a blunt object or a fall on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the periosteum which is below the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair, and for this reason this type is called a hairline fracture.
And there is a fracture that is caused either by a fall or by a blow with a stone and similar things, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter the inner parts, and it is made in a concave place, just as happens to the sides of a ram when a blow is struck and a part of it is driven inwards.
And this happens especially in the bodies of moist bones, such as the skulls of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will come with the repositioning of all of this in its place.
And we will know all these types of fracture by detection of those and by the inquiry of their state, with probes and removal of corrupt flesh which is upon them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and is cleaned, and examined with a probe, for the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of fractures, consider at the beginning the accidents of the patient, and then if you see by the accidents that signify by manifest signification concerning fear, such as vomiting of bile, extension, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and swelling of the eyes and redness of them, and similar to them of the accidents in the major dispositions, without doubt it is not healed.
And if you see no unusual accidents, you expect health, then you begin his treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person has come to you at the beginning as injured, and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you study the setting of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all disposition.
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you take care to set the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone is corrupted by the panniculus (flesh), and that the accidents that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the panniculus covering the brain, and is with small particles and attrition, then it is necessary that you incise the comminuted and atrophied part, as I shall recount to you.
And it is that you shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as much as possible according to the shape of the wound, and that it is light on the patient.
And if you encounter upon detection of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you oppose it with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths infused in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is sedated, and you are sure of the flow of blood; and then begin the encirclement of the bone and its ablation.
And this should be according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its form:  And then administer another incisor, this one, a little wider than that one; and this is its form:
And then administer yet another, wider incisor than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a number of different incisors, of which some are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others and be sharpened at the ends, and be of Indian or tempered iron.
And use them easily in percussion on the incisor so that you do not strike the head and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you administer the incisors with the drills, which are called non-penetrating drills.
And they are not named thus except because those do not reach the limit of the skull bone next to it, because the drill has a round end or edge on that which is below its sharp head, similar to a small edge or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take of these drills a large number, each of which suits the thickness of each bone, so that you have present for all parts of the skull an end which is sharp, the quantity in length and shortness being according to the quantity of the thickness of that part.
And this is the form of three types of drills: The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is that you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; and then move the drill to another place, and place what is between each hole the amount of the thickness of a ray or thereabouts.
And then incise with incisors that which is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as you can on that end for lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument, using tools which you will have prepared for this, such as thin pincers and forceps.
And you must take great care that the incisor does not touch any part of the brain.
And so when you have encircled the bone by perforating it, and it is separated from the brain if it is connected to it, and you have extracted it, you must scrape and smooth its roughness with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other incisors.
And if some small and splintered bone fragments remain, then remove them easily with the instruments you have; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments which we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is easier, far from frightening, which Gualia described and praised greatly; and this is his account: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin by uncovering the part of the bone at the place where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and have placed under it the end of this slow and gentle incisor, of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided in two lengthwise, like a wedge; so that the lenticular part is applied to the brain with its face, the sharp part cutting into the bone.
And then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until it cuts through all the bone easily as it is turned, and you are certain of the periosteum that no accident which you fear occurs in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, even if he were sleeping.
Then, if any matter attached to the bone remains in the periosteum in some places of the bone, cut it away with the lenticular end of that incisor, and it will be removed easily, for it is removed without harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the periosteum, and that which is separated or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and small splinters remain, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of different sizes so that it is possible for you to apply in each place the most suitable and most appropriate of them according to what your operation requires for that broken bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that you apply in your scraping, with which you scrape the bone initially, the broadest of those rasps, and then use progressively the more subtle ones, and do not cease doing this continuously until you come to apply the finest and most subtle of all of them.
But in each of the other small, hair-like fractures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to what is required for its correction.
And it is a matter that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And I stand by what we have written and shown concerning large fractures.
And if the panniculus (flesh) is retracted when you extract the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and submerge that in rose oil, and place that over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and submerge it in wine and rose oil and place that over the thin cloth, and do this as gently as you can so that you do not hurt the flesh; and then apply a broad bandage over that, and do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds the wound only.
And leave it with this dressing for one or two days until you are sure of a hot abscess; and then untie it and then administer medicines with which there is superfluous dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour, and powder of lentils and birthwort, and similar things to those.
And it is necessary that you make a powder from these medicines to be sprinkled on the wound, once they are dry; and universally, apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not bite (or irritate).
And take care, according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment is clean; and that there is no dirt from ointment or anything else; nor allow any virulence to gather there; for when it is applied to the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts and poisons it, and thus causes great harm to the patient.
And it affects the brain, as the bone is cleaned, and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if the patient suffers the accidents that we have mentioned, know that it is pernicious without any doubt.
And if there is blackness not from the medicine that is placed on top, but it is in virtue of that medicine that produces that blackness, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and then place it on the head; and then treat it with the appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in two main parts together, or one of those sometimes, because it has two bones, because the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken and only suffers from abrasion, crookedness, and sinuosity.
But if one of the two parts of it is broken, then you should insert your little finger into his nose, and that you align that fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and be careful that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it must be set with the end of a rod which has a small thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same thing.
And take care with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then after seven or ten days you should treat the resulting abscess with cautery.
And then insert into the end of the nose a small roll of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or place two small wedges, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the wedge be of such a size that it fills the opening of the nose.
And I say that some of the ancient restorers say that the wedges should be soaked in a certain type of plaster and changed every day, but I have not seen this; rather it is necessary that the roll be soaked in egg white mixed with powdered barley; and then leave the wedge until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a wedge, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, is inserted into the nose; and  let it be if you have a more severe nasal fracture and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use wedges.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, plaster the nose with cerate or cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster that area externally with sesame flour and cooked linseed powder mixed with egg white; and then place linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary to incise over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then sew the incision, and treat it with what causes granulation and consolidation, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with wedges and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
On the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external and is not broken in two, and is bent only at the inner parts, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with that the hump of the fracture inwards, easily to the outer parts, with your other hand from the outside of the bone; with this adjust it suitably so.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides according to the straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if there is concussion of teeth with disruption, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place over the broken jaw a cerate, and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place over the cloth a well-made large splint, or a piece of sole leather equal to the length of the jaw; and then tie that on top according to how the bandage is prepared for you and how the application suits, until it is healed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him food of sorbitious drinks.  (Note: "sorbitious" likely refers to a type of easily digestible liquid or broth.)
And if you estimate that the form is already altered in some way, then you should attend to it and untie it on the third day; and then rectify what is already altered and plaster it with pulverized barley, with egg white, or with bean flour, after you have removed the cerate from it, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and fitted, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it; do not untie it until it is healed and the fracture is firm; for many times this fracture is firm in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and that abscess is softened.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for that in removing them from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for it and that will cause it to heal, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture is done in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is so that splinters are present, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the splint and aligns the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Then bind the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correctly formed, and there is neither too much prominence nor concavity.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's neck a roll of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your needs; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the roll with your hand until you bind the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards, because it has reached the sternum, then the patient should be lying supine on their neck, and you should place a moderately sized cushion on the muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the clavicle bone that is on the sternum above is elevated, and then you straighten the fracture and bind it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are loose, then you should make an incision over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you carefully make an incision with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after having placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves the bandage; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is the shape:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size or smallness of the bone.
But let its length be as is possible for you in the operation; let it have two ends like a spoon, and one end be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And above all, ensure the splint is not misplaced over the broken bone; and for this reason it is necessary that you see the patient each day, so that when the bandage is loosened, or you see that the splint has shifted, then you correct this and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion under their scrotum at night on top of their pillow; so that with this the injured area is elevated, and thus the fractured collarbone is elevated by the muscle; or let their arm be tied to their neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless an abscess or swelling occurs at the site, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the binding and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the collarbone is healed and consolidated.
And it is strengthened and healed, according to the case, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken on its lateral side, and not shattered, only the edges are broken.
And so when the location of the break — and it is broken in the middle of the location — is not known except by touch, then, according to what the form of the fracture is, force the preparation of it and reduce it according to its natural form in every way that is possible for you.
Then place on the area powdered finely ground egg white and lion's wool; then place a poultice of folded cloth; and then place over it a smoothly-ironed linen cloth of fine quality, according to the size of the entire shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the linen is concave in any place on the shoulder blade, then you fill that concavity with lion's wool, and then smooth the linen to make it even.
Then bind it above with a long bandage with a decent constriction and firmness of the linen so that it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage each day; and every time that it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and smooth the linen if it has been moved from its place.
And have the patient lie on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And so when this number is completed, then you dissolve the bandage, and you should know for certain that this is of the bones of which the beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the fractured bone and pushes down under the skin, then you incise over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle regarding the cauterization of the abscess if it occurs here.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster because they are scarred and comminuted.
And of its accidents, when the middle of the foot is broken, it inclines towards the inner parts and causes great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, strong fever, and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient should be supine on his back, and a cushion placed between his shoulders; and then press on his muscles, and adjust his bones with hands from both sides, and be meticulous in the operation and in the alignment in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone's shape is restored as it should be.
Then apply a plaster and lint, and place over it a thin splint of willow or hazel, or something similar in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth; and be careful in binding it over the broken bone so that it is not moved; and apply the bandage in a circular fashion to the back sometimes, and tighten it with a decent constriction; and check the bandage frequently, and tighten it when it is loosened.
And if necessity requires loosening of the bandage because of corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then you should examine and unbind it and remove the plaster and rectify what has occurred by appropriate treatment; and reapply the plaster, if you see fit; and adjust the bandage until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of the ribs when they are fractured.
Know that fracture of the ribs occurs only in the thicker parts, that is, the two; and in the extremities, from the front part, no crushing occurs because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge of it is not hidden from the feeling or investigation of it through the fingers.
And the restoration should be thus: equalize the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until it is joined as needed, and then plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if it is necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the inner parts, then the patient suffers vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the Ancients were ingenious in that with many inventions.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we should avoid this so that it does not lightly cause a hot abscess, if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then it already helps with that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw with force; and this is similar to reasoning, but however, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is even as it wraps that according to roundness; and then the patient should be treated with a pleurisy cure of food and medicine.
And if a vehement cause constricts the patient which he does not suffer, and the bone pierces the skin with a harmful puncture, threatening the patient, then it is necessary that we incise the place, uncover the broken rib, and then place on it an instrument that preserves the  ciph (likely referring to a specific surgical instrument or technique, perhaps related to bone setting), the recollection of which is previously mentioned, and that we incise the bone easily, and extract it.
And then we should join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an internal abscess occurs, then you should take and mix powders in rose oil and apply it to the place, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for an internal abscess.
And let him be supine on the side on which he sleeps until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and then it leads to their attrition, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider this: for if you see his hands already softened, stupefied, and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor flex them, and when you constrain them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most dispositions it is mortal.
And if he moves those and feels constriction in them with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if he shows in the vertebrae of the neck something similar to that and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, what happened to the hands happens to them, and moreover when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he is lying on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not work on his cure.
But if none of those things happen, the cause is better and lighter.
And the treatment for him is that you perform a cauterization of the hot abscess, that you place on the affected or reddened vertebra  pure olive oil, or with cooked egg yolks; apply this several times a day until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not to sleep on the part where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if it happens that because of the attrition of the bone splinters or any cause that it is already separated from it, then it is necessary that you cut it at the joint and that you remove that bone; and then join the two lips of the wound with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the posterior part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the hip joint, then it is necessary that you insert the index finger of your left hand into the rectum, and that you align the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible by second intention; and then apply a plaster and bandage, if you have them, and then bind it.
And if you feel broken splinters in it, then you should cut into that area, and remove them, and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the hip.
Hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are broken, then their fracture is only a communication in the extremities of those bones, and they are incised lengthwise and incline towards the inner parts; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only in its extremity, then you set it according to what is prepared for you by equal setting until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines towards the lower parts, then you make the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And then when you have set it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or whalebone over that, and bind it tightly so that you do not fear a puncture of the fracture or movement of the splint.
And fill the concavity with something that fills it until it takes the binding according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place upon it that which settles it as has been previously described; and then return to the restoration of it, and bind it as is necessary.
And if it happens in the bones that they are pierced or comminuted (shattered), then you extract them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the collarbone (clavicle).
The collarbone is that which is between the ribcage and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of medium thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at both ends, and then let it be suspended from an elevated place.
And seat the patient on a stool; and then lay his broken arm over the splint until it reaches his wrist, in the middle of which the curve of the splint should be attached.
And then suspend some heavy object from it, or let the assistant pull it downwards; and then let the physician set the fracture with his hands, until the fracture is properly reset.
And the other method is that the patient be laid supine on his back, and suspend the arm from his neck with a bandage; and then command two assistants that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold what is below it; and each of them pull in his direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then bind the fracture with a bandage, and over that with another bandage, and let each of the two assistants pull in opposite directions.
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the wrist and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that spot and on that elbow.
Swallow it easily and without effort, and then, when it is swallowed as needed and applied with proper application, bind it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day, and place on it soiled wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you bind it.
And the way to bind it is to place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand on its muscle.
And place the cloth and bind the arm to the support so that the arm is in a steady position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is necessary that you place over the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then bind over the splints with the bandage which I described at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is necessary that your bandage over the place of the fracture be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you proceed.
And if you fear a hot abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then consider the bandage in all parts for three days so that itching or inflammation does not occur in the area; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the tightness of the bandage; and therefore rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleeping position be on their side, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place over the injured area a poultice full of wool evenly, and check every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is not softened; therefore rectify all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is light at the beginning until the [condition/wound] begins to tighten; and then it is necessary to thicken his food.
For it is customary for the injured area and his leg to be bandaged for forty days; and then it is necessary that they be unbound and that a bath be administered and it be medicated with ointments which rectify this.
And if the fracture is badly bruised, then you should not untie the bandage and splints from that until one month or until two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and it is that which is placed below the little finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger focile is broken alone, or the smaller, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focile is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the focile is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small focile above, then it is convenient for the physician, during its restoration, to apply slight extension easily until it is set.
But if the large focile is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply more forceful extension.
And if both fociles are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you position your hand during its restoration and extension, stretched out on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be on the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a sloping chair.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer strain.
Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should manipulate the bone until he reduces it to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then you must forcefully reduce all pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated splinter appears in it that punctures the skin and there is no hope in its restoration, then you should saw it off and remove it according to the method which we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dealt with that in a separate chapter, and therefore take the treatment from there.
And if an abscess occurs near the beginning of your reduction, then you should line a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil and white wax, and it should be of medium consistency between thick and thin, and bind the cloth tightly over it with a subtle binding until the abscess has subsided; and then remove the cerate and apply a plaster prepared from powdered millet with egg white, and then apply poultices; and let the poultice that is placed over the fracture be thicker and stronger.
And know that the number of poultices for the arm is increased in more serious cases, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your binding over the site of the fracture more firmly and more tightly, and if the binding is closer to the parts above the fracture or to the parts below it, apply the binding a little more loosely, as was explained at the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist cloths, and not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is bound should be of medium thickness, neither too thin nor too thick, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any condition occurs which requires correction, such as itching which affects the limb, then you must bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the binding.
And if the binding is now softened and the bone is now healed and similar to the others, then correct all that with your skill.
And consider further if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb by an excessive tightness of the binding, for then it is necessary that you loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the conditions we have mentioned, then it is not necessary that the binding be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
And then let the patient's hand be suspended by its own power of agitated movement, and make the patient sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or it is quickly restored in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the disposition of the vital force.
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the wrist and finger joints; rather, they usually suffer attrition.
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down and place a cushion in front of him to support it, then place his hand on that extended surface.
Then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician aligns them until they are joined with a good connection.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess occurs; then apply a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and wrap it in linen.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to hold it with his fractured palm; then it should be firmly bound with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth, in which there should be lightness, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a bandage above and another below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, as the hand is held in place between the fingers with ligatures.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as needed and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, place a small, straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or in the index, or in the ring finger, or in the little finger, then it should be bandaged and bound to the finger next to it; or all should be bound together continuously, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and near that, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose — with your operation — what is necessary when any of these things occur, according to the repeated narration of it.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is revealed to the senses according to how it is turned towards the front and the more superior part.
And its restoration is done thus: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their belly and face.
And then the physician extends the whole bandage to its part according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then let the bandage be close to the knee on the side of the patella, so that the extension falls upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the bandage be made close to the knee, and let the extension be to the parts below.
And then the physician joins the bone with both his hands until he reduces it to its natural appearance and the bone is joined by a good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs there, then you leave it for a few days until the abscess has matured, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made thus:  You should wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and double it two or three times, removing any excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And place a long strip of cloth between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the cloth come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh that which is superfluous from the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is secure.
And then begin with a firm bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and the further you move away from the fracture site, the looser, lighter, and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the cloth to the lower parts until they reach the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not loosened from its place.
And then leave the bandage on, provided that there is no corruption, hot abscess, swelling, or similar conditions affecting the limb; and if any of these conditions should occur, then loosen the bandage, and rectify the situation completely, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone that protrudes, then you must reposition it as best you can; and if not, cover it and keep it in place, and treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened further after the splints are applied, as we have described in the treatment of the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this manner, the patient does not experience lameness; and if it is restored alone, without the other leg being supported, then it is necessary that he will limp from that leg always.
And know that the thigh is bound for forty days, or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but very often causes attrition (wear and tear/friction).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and all of it is accompanied by sensation.
And its restoration is such that what is broken of its parts should be aligned with said parts until it is joined and united as much as possible by equalization, ease and fabrication (i.e., setting the bone).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and bind it tightly above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the precautions that we have recommended in other fractures, such as hot poultices and similar things, so that every accident is countered with what is suitable for him until he is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large and is called by the name of the leg; and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
And whatever kinds of fractures happen to the two bones of the arm, the same happens to the two bones of the leg, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and its operation is one and the same.
And if the two bones are broken together, the leg is injured in all its parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is injured in the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it below, and it is one of those things which are not easily treated by you.
Then administer extension, setting, and bandaging of the splints according to the same method.
However, if the leg fracture is large, having many splinters, the extension should be less and lighter, and relieve it with your skill.
And in the leg there is some cause for surgery similar to the arm, and when you align the splints and complete your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the parts which are placed on the soles, and these are made suitably from palm branches; choose those of small thickness, and let them not be very slender, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the very bottom.
Then wrap around each [splint] a cloth in two layers according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, and they should be from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then bind the two splints in three places: at the two ends and in the middle, for with this fastening the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint has been provided, according to the length of the leg; and let the leg be placed on it so that it retains that position.
And especially it is necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when with this there is a proper wound.
Then examine the leg each day and study it carefully, and watch it for abscesses and inflammation or other similar problems; and if any of these problems occur, then apply to it what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes occur rarely, and what happens to them is more often attrition during mishaps.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and sometimes those bones are elevated above each other, then the patient should place his foot on the ground prepared in this way as before.
Then place one foot on what is elevated of those bones, and then press down on them, and squeeze, and pull them until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and lint on top, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two flat pieces are attached.
Then bind that with the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and with other things of which you have need.
And when three or four days have passed for him, then you untie the bandage, for you will find the bones joined, or whether they are fractured or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if someone says they are fractured, then restore them, and pull them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint on the fractured finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little longer than it; and place under the foot that board which I have recounted to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is fractured of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board to the lowest part of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board outside the sole of the foot so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you do not forget that you consider all the things which I have said to you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is appropriate.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of the woman is fractured, then make her lie down in a low bed, and gently incline her to one side, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it is made in her hip like a ball; and then the woman is covered, and her leg is raised little by little, because all this is useless until the hip joint is like a ball and the fractured bone returns [to its place].
And then place powders on her leg, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and reduce and return it according to the manner in which you set it at the beginning, and then return to the first powdering.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach a reed tube to its opening; and introduce the whole bladder into her hip, and then inflate it through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will return the fracture [to its place].
And then it is filled with cotton and remains for several days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the pubis of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing that which we have recommended for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures which occur rarely, especially for one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for this fracture indicates to you the best methods for its restoration and repair, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take a hen's gizzard and place the penis inside it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it remain for three days or so, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractured bones when there is a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar to those, that you carefully attend to and immediately phlebotomize him if the conditions for phlebotomy indicate it as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then you must attend to its retention so that you pulverize crushed egg whites over it, if no other cause is present to you.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that very day, and do not prolong it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered, then you must carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands with this instrument; and it is an instrument which is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers, and the width of which is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, according to the quantity needed for this in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent by the compression on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its ends; and let the upper part of it be of increasing thickness, and from the middle of it to the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Because it is necessary that its sharp end be placed raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and it is set with some equalization.
And then strive to equalize the ends of the fracture between them, and if the broken end of the bone is thin, and does not receive the instrument well, then you must incise the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone entirely with what we have recounted, then incise it with whatever is suitable from among the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds vehement and persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do this because you will confer great benefit to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption there.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you incise the opening with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and caused death or a corrosive and suppurating illness, that is, gangrene, in their patients. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a bandage of hard cloths instead of stitches and bind it with those.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to fester, then you remove the cloth which you had placed on it with wine, and then administer poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it behooves you to unbind the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and closed, and the limb should be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down from it to the lower parts easily.
If many days pass and the wound is neither consolidated nor is the pus removed from it, then know that here are signs of small [insects/worms], for which you must examine the wound with a probe. And of those signs, those that are separated, remove and extract them; those which are not separated and which impede the limb and cause pain, you are compelled to incise them as far as is possible for you.
And if a swelling or ulcer occurs in the wound, that is, a stye, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of these with what is appropriate for it from the treatment which has been described previously in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should focus on, and you should pay attention to this point: when a large bone is fractured, such as the bone of the thigh and the hip and similar large bones, and you should not attempt its traction or extraction, because many times death results from this; rather, leave it until it festers, for it will fall away by itself quite quickly within twenty or thirty days; and then, if you deem it necessary, treat the wound, otherwise leave it.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: On the treatment of swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of a healing fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, cerecloth, and acacia, and similar substances;  take some or all of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply this to the swelling on a piece of linen, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage on without loosening it for many days; then unbind it and reapply another, until the swelling is reduced; or apply a lead plate tightly, because lead has the property of reducing anything swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already hardened and become constricted, and necessity demands its removal carefully, then incise it in the most suitable place, and cut away the excess and prominent part, or scrape it with a sharp instrument until it is reduced; and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when it is set and the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is set, and afterward the limb remains thin and weak, this is caused by many things: one of which is an excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not done as it should be; or by excessive tightness of the bandages so that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb; or by excessive and superfluous embrocation (application of a medicated liquid); or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and make their heart cheerful so that their blood is increased; and administer a bath; and instill joy and merriment in them.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water, until nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22: Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, in a limb already set, there is near healing from crookedness and swelling at the fractured bone and node, and this causes deformity of the limb, but nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the word of one who thinks that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this operation is most blameworthy, leading to great fear, the sign of which is deadly.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed with lukewarm water in which are boiled emollient herbs, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar ones; and a poultice should be made with a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be prepared and mixed with goose grease or olive oil, and applied as a poultice; or ripe figs should be taken and crushed with pigeon dung, and similar things among those medicines called consolidating remedies.
And sometimes it is resolved with gentle, frequent rubbing with moistened hands, and movement of the limb in all directions should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become hardened and turned to bone, and recourse to treatment with iron is necessary, then the most prominent part should be removed and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells from the node of the bone itself should be incised with fine scalpels, and relief should be provided with care and diligence.
Chapter 23.
Concerning discourse on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their place, whereby movement is prevented, the shape of the limb is distorted, and great pain and injury are caused to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to immediately strive that it be reduced, and not delay that reduction, for if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and quickly, and thereby the reduction of the dislocation is made difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, for many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and let it be left until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated so that what is remembered returns to its place.
And I have now ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what preceded in fracture; from the most superior part of the body to the most inferior part.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, it is not delayed; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are removed from their places by slight movement, and are slightly softened; or they are dislocated by complete and total dislocation, until they are softened at the joint, until the patient's saliva flows and they cannot hold it nor close their mouth, and their tongue is entangled in their speech.
But when their dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then it is necessary that reduction be administered to it lightly, and not be delayed at all.
And it is that the attendant holds the head of the patient, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocation of the jaw inside their mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he inserts both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands are outside with which he pulls; and he commands the patient to relax their jaws and free them from any movement; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if its reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer evaporation with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easy and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on it powders of cloth with cerate, and let it be made of wax and rose oil; and then let it be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their side, and their head be between two pillows, so that it does not move to the right or left; and do not force them to chew anything; before their food, let it be very soft, until when the pains are relieved and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not work on opening the mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is healed and healthy.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at any time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and persistent thirst occur, and the patient's belly is easily distended, and they easily vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and many times he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards by its connection with the ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is apparent to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. Then constrict the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
Then place a plaster and powders on that and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the elbow and is continuous with it, is not dislocated on any day; then it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is appropriate to you.
Then place a plaster, and powders, and a bandage on it, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated from the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated to the rear parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts by the nerves.
And mostly it is dislocated and comes out from the lower parts below the shoulder, and especially in those whose flesh is little, it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or a fall, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is believed that it is dislocated because of this.
Then it is necessary that you prove this before you are completely certain of it, and then you proceed with its cure.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the shoulder; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity below the shoulder near the touching of the head of the muscle like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it through all movements.
If it is dislocated near the feet or above, and you then find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands below his shoulder, and raises the joint strongly up to its place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns lightly.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning that the dislocation happened, many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and an embrocation be administered that softens and lubricates, such as boiled roots of althea, and fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered.
And then the patient should lie supine on his back and a wool cushion be placed under his shoulder, which should be equally between softness and firmness, and then the physician places his heel on the cushion, and raises the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the patient's arm so that it is not pulled downwards, and another minister holds the patient's head so that it is not pulled downwards, because then it immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this manner: and it is that you have present a man who is taller than the patient, and stands on that side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's shoulder and raises his shoulder upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's arm from the lower parts of his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced thus according to another method: and it is that a long pole is fixed in the ground, the head of which is round in shape, like a pestle, which is neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient; after being placed on the head of the pole soft cloths, and the patient is standing along the length of the pole, and then his arm is extended downwards on the other side; and his body is extended on the other side with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if its reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: and it is that you take a stick the length of which is two cubits, and its width is four fingers, and its thickness is reduced at the end for the shoulder according to this form:
And then soft cloths are tied over the round head so that the stick does not injure the patient.
And then it is placed under the patient's shoulder, and the hand or arm is extended over the stick down to the lower parts, and the stick is tied above the shoulder and arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a step of a ladder according to its width, and the hand is extended to the lower parts, and the rest of the body is suspended on the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its entry is completed in any way possible for you, then you must place under the shoulder a ball of wool of equal quantity; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered comfrey and egg white over the entire muscle, so that it is wrapped over it, and then tighten it below the shoulder with a decent bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and his hand should be bound to his neck, and it should be left, and his hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's diet be light, until the limb is strengthened, for this is more conducive to his healing.
And then the diet should be increased after seven or five days, and some movement should be exercised; and so if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity that affects it or another cause, then in that case cautery with three punctures should be administered, as previously described in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and bandage are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and hangs loose and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that his nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are severed or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Concerning the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the back parts, the reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And let another bandage be applied to that [area], and care for it until it is healed.
And if during healing heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use baths many times until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its former natural state.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of a hip dislocation.
Know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and mostly to the front rather than to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is apparent to sight or touch, according to whatever manner it is dislocated. And when you adjust the dislocated hip with the sound [healthy] one, this is manifestly clear to you, for the joint is concave and he cannot bend his leg, nor touch with that [leg] his thigh.
And it is necessary that you attend to it, and reduce the dislocation quickly before a hot abscess forms there, for if a hot abscess forms there, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is in the back parts, for it is the worst of all other types of dislocation, and most painful, and many times it results in death from it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his leg be extended with two hands, and his thigh be extended, and the physician's hands be on the hip and below it, and he should pull the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then return it thus: bend the leg with your hand, until you strike the hip with the root of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and hold it firmly, two assistants so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it is wrapped in a long doubled cloth over his hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint that hand with some oil so that this may aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with vigorous force until it returns to its place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that he be placed on a plaster which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and be bound tightly with a descending bandage, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and left like that for a few days.
And afterwards it should be unbound; and then if the joint is set in its place, then you untie his bandage and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well tightened, then you repeat the plaster and bandage, and leave it for a few days until it is tightened; and afterwards unbind it.
But if the patient experiences pain after the reduction of the joint, and his condition is in movement (i.e., the pain is ongoing), then administer moist heat in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until he is relieved; or place on the joint alleviative salves, that is, something very fatty; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bone day and night. And afterwards remove that, and put it in a bath; and when it is sufficiently softened, then you rub the joint with temperate friction, and afterwards repeat the application of the alleviative salve, that is, very fatty ointment, once, and a second time, and a third. with the aid of a bath, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place on it a warm, moist ox bladder, tied tightly over it; and do this several times, for it is moistening and helps to reduce the inflammation.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the wrist, that is, of the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Sometimes the wrist is dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy, unlike other joints. However, it is necessary that there be speed in its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms in it.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table and the assistant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint, and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already facing the belly of the hand; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during extension and reduction.  And if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of that hand should be on the table with the palm facing down, so that the physician's hand can fall upon that prominence of the joint.
And therefore, if it returns immediately, it is good; but if not, then constrict it with a poultice to reduce the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not endure or be able to reduce it once more days have passed.
However, if the joint remains in its distorted position and causes no harm to the patient except that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are pinched or crushed.  Then there is no remedy except to constrict it with a cautery near the injury, and quickly apply some dressing.
Therefore, when the bone is reset, then apply the poultice we have described, and let it remain and constrict for five days; and then let it be untied and left, and let the patient's hand be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and some severity occurs, then soothe it with warm water and friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in their entirety.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated towards the back of the palm or the belly of the hand, then stretch the finger and gently push the dislocation back with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it downwards from the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for some days until it is tight (or strong/stable).
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts (of the body).
Chapter 30.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are displaced from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death threatens the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and many times some of their limbs are paralyzed, or their two legs, or their two arms, or one of these; or one vertebra is displaced from its place, for many times it is displaced and many times the displacement affects four parts.
Therefore, it is already displaced in the back parts and is called yellowness (jaundice - likely a misdiagnosis or symptom overlap).
But the treatment is that you consider if the yellowness (jaundice) comes from consumption (tuberculosis, wasting disease), because then there is no cure for it, nor is there any complete healing.
But in that which comes from a fall or a blow or something similar, the Ancients described the methods of cure with long discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have already abridged it,  whose brevity excuses the excess,  due to my proximity to my intended explanation, with which I have exposed and formed this from various instruments with which I will show and explain this.
And of these, only that which occurs in the two [sides/feet] properly, with what I have recounted, is cured.
And it is so that the patient should be laid on his back against a wall, and a soft mat should be placed under him so that his feet are not hurt.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the earth at the head end of the bed near his head, and another pole near his feet at the other end of the bed.
And the assistant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another assistant should hold the other one in the same way.
Then wrap a strong linen bandage around the patient's head and neck; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is by his head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around his hips, thighs, and legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is by his feet.
And then each assistant should extend the bandage to its respective pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be removed from their places where they are fixed, but nevertheless they should not be fastened as we have said.
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with firmness until it returns, or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, into which the end of the board fits. And then place half the board on the spine, and the physician place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a revolving drill turned by hand; and you should place in the ground, near the patient's head and behind the buttocks, two poles, whose length is one braccio, and near the head in the back of the buttocks two more poles; and let the distance between each pole be one palm, and let there be a hole made in each pole through which the drill passes, and let each be firmly fixed in the ground so that it is not moved.
And let there be a round pole on which the drill is mounted, and let it be rotated in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole into which the drill is fitted, the length of which is one palm including that which is rotated; and in the other two poles is something similar to that.
And then tighten the ligatures that you have tied to the patient's feet in the hole which is near their head, and the ligatures that you have tied to their thighs in the hole which is near their feet.
And then near each drill let there be a person who turns the drill with their hand, and the physician manipulates the vertebra as we have said.
And then, once the vertebra is returned and the area is manipulated, it is necessary that you apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a piece of linen cloth, the width of which should be three fingers or thereabouts, and the length should be sufficient to cover the area of the swelling, and over the part of the affected vertebra.
And then it should be bound with the ligature which we have mentioned, and the patient should be given light nourishment until they are healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the application of the linen cloth for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is then applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the area behind the vertebrae of the back, and it is caused by that dislocation; and that is a bone which already protrudes, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint are subject only to dislocation, and that which happens to them does not happen to other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and less often forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its dislocation inwards is that, when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain, and it is in that place that the pain is sometimes accompanied by a hot abscess, because the head of the femur has already reached there.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens outwards is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And a sign of dislocation forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but nevertheless cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk, he cannot do so forwards; and his urine is retained, and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign of dislocation backwards is that he cannot extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending his hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and his groin is softened, and the head of the femur is towards that place.
But the reduction of these types of dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and longstanding, that it has already become established, and if you attempt reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not entirely curable; and then no presumption should be made in this matter.
But in the case where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care that you return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it quickly returns and does not need further treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare strong assistants and extend his leg from the lower part, either with your hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extend his hand from above in such a way that he places his hands under his armpits; and then tighten a strong bandage around the root of the thigh, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from the inside of the groin to the area of the clavicle, or from the back to the area of the spine.
And let the extension of all these be at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type [of dislocation] that which we will say of its proper cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is towards the inside, the patient should be supine on his sound side; and then place the ligatures on the root of the thigh in the space between the head of the thigh and the place which is below the groin; and then extend the ligature from the groin to the highest part of the clavicle.
And then another strong assistant grasps his arms, and pulls the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a vigorous extension, because then it returns to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, with which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is dislocated upwards and does not yield to treatment with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that both feet of the patient be tied together with a strong, light ligature, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each (ligature) be the quantity of four digits, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two digits.
And then the patient should be suspended by the head from a beam, and let him be inside the house; and let his height from the ground be the quantity of two arms' lengths.
And then order a strong young man to reduce the head of the thigh, and let another young man suspend the patient, and the other young man, reducing the thigh with forceful pulling, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation outwards, it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, as we have recounted in the case of the cold abscess; and let the ligature be tightened on the affected leg specifically and on his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then let adjusted beams be placed in the middle of the elevated part on which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that during the extension to the lower parts it is not pulled.
And then each assistant extends on his side, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the anterior parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narration on an elevation; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the dislocated joint of the patient, and then grasps that with the other hand, and with that grasp places that which is extended to the lower parts at the joint of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the posterior parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower parts, and he is elevated above the ground; instead, it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated to the outside, according to what we have said about his lying on two hips; and he is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, there is little difference.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board on the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as necessary — and the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you, and that is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient stretches his leg and extends it without difficulty, then know that the limb is returned as necessary — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it so that the hip is not moved in any of the parts; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
And then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
And then untie it, and have him delay walking on it for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards, more towards the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to bring their leg to their thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its types is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that they extend their leg, if they can; adhere your two hands to the front of the knee, and place their foot between your feet; and then make the patient's knee adhere to your palms, and hold those between your fingers above the knee with strength, and another assistant extend their foot until the knee returns to its place.
And a sign of its reduction is that their leg adheres to the thigh easily and without effort.
And then plaster that and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with the bandages of which the use in the treatment of the hip was described previously.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the talus (ankle bone).
The talus is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and its dislocation is made either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its slight displacement is gentle reduction, and this is done by extending it easily with the hands and gently pulling it until it returns to its place.
But in treating it when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind at the back of his thigh in the middle of the leg.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from its uppermost part, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left hand, twice, and then extend it with your left; and gently push the foot with your right hand down the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have described.
Then push the foot against the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Then it will return in one or two tries, according to this method, and if you see the foot set, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, because that will return it.
But if the reduction is forbidden to you by what we have recounted, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tighten a firmly fixed rope on the ground that lies between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so that it does not injure the patient.
Then let the patient's attendant hold their thighs, and let another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage that is tied around the ankle; and then let each attendant extend against the extension of their pair, and let the rope remain between the patient's thighs, holding it, so that their body is not pulled downwards beyond its extension.
Then let the physician set the dislocation with his hands, and let another attendant hold the healthy thigh below, because the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation is returned and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
And it is necessary that you fear or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not tight and strongly injures them.
Then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
Then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and corrupted again, and consequently that it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its evacuation that which we described previously, in another place of treatment and embrocation, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary that what is dislocated be healed with little extension without effort; and this is not difficult, rather it is light/easy.
But if the dislocation is in some bone of the big toe, then it is necessary that you make the patient put his foot on the ground or on a table, and be positioned as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is healed and no prominence appears in the place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the entire foot, to which two ends are attached, and then tighten it with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then untie it and have him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of those causes occur, and you engage in its treatment and restoration, death often ensues.
And therefore, one should not presume to treat it, except someone skilled in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and who uses, at the beginning, only medicines that reduce hot abscesses, and leaves the patient to divine judgment, except for the one in whom you expect salvation from perdition, with alleviation of the illness, and in whom some hope appears. And then strive immediately to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then, if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that reduces hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is appropriate for it, of desiccative ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and the shattered bone pieces occur, then you must attempt to join them, and do in this what we have said in the simple illnesses that precede in those locations.
And guard and avoid, according to your virtue, that entry into paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for that is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more salutary to your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
