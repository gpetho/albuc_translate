of chronic pain in any limb
When pain comes to any member, either from falling or injury, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical cures do not work, then it must be cauterized with the cautery called "poins", and let the cautery be according to the length of the member and its smallness, its weakness, its strength, and its location of twists and pain. If healed by the first cautery, it is good; if not, repeat another cautery on the same spot, because such a habit is that it must be moved to the nearby member, for which it is necessary to make cauteries until the patient is healed.
