Know that when a break occurs in one of these cartilaginous structures, it heals poorly, except in some people.	You should know that when discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment of them rarely does any good, except in a few people.	0.83751196
It is therefore necessary when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a suture, then treat it until it is healed;	When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.	0.7297454
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must scrape all the parts of their core until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tighten it, and sprinkle on powder of dragon's blood, and ground incense; and put over the powders a piece of strong plaster or other binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.	If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.	0.8310917
The method of suturing is that you bring together the separated parts: either with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the abdomen; or with thread, as I have explained to you.	Now the manner of suturing is to close the discontinuity, either with a needle, as we describe for suture of the belly, or with a thread as we tell you there.	0.74953747
