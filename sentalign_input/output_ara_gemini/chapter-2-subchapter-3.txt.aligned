If a person experiences chronic migraine or acute catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and is treated with various medical treatments, but that does not work then we have experimented in these diseases with incising the arteries of the temples or cauterizing them as we have described.	When a man has a chronic migraine or acute catarrh, on account of acrid humidities and heat in the temporal muscles, or a violent chronic headache, or the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, we have sometimes in these diseases tried extraction of the arteries from the temples or cauterization of them, already described.	0.89820117
And the way to incise them is that the patient shaves the hair that is on the temples and you aim for the artery that is apparent in the temple, for it will be clear to you from its pulse. And it rarely hides except in a few people or during intense cold.	The manner of extraction is for the patient to shave the temporal hair; then you press upon the artery appearing on the temple; for it will be manifest to you by its pulsation, and is rarely invisible save in a few people or on account of severe cold.	0.84728515
If it is hidden from you, then let the patient tighten his neck with the extra part of his garment. Then you rub the place with a cloth or compress the place with hot water until the artery appears clearly and distinctly. Then you take the lancet, which is pictured here: Then gently flay the skin until you reach the artery.	But if it is not plain to you then let the patient bind his neck with the end of his garment; then do you rub the place with a piece of cloth or foment with hot water, till the artery is obvious to you; then take a scalpel shaped thus; then with it gently scrape away the skin till you come to the artery, then stick a hook in it and draw it upward till you extract it from the skin and free it all round from the membranes that are beneath it.	0.8473642
If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. Then cut a part of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract without causing bleeding. For if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not thin at all.	But if the artery be thin, twist it with the tip of the hook and cut out enough of it for the two ends to be well separated from one another and contract so that no haemorrhage occurs; for if it is not divided and cut it will not let blood flow at all.	0.8288361
Then let out blood from six to three ounces.	Then let blood, from six to three ounces.	0.95156
If the artery is large, it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread. And let the thread be either silk or lute strings so that putrefaction does not quickly reach it before the wound heals, causing bleeding.	If the artery be large it should be ligated in two places with a strong double thread; the threads should be either silken or lute-string, lest corruption attack them before the wound is healed, and haemorrhage occur.	0.8978122
Then cut the excess between the two ligatures. Do this at that time or after another time.	Then cut away what remains between the two ligatures; do that immediately or later.	0.8518862
And if you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are severed, which will serve the same purpose, or better, as we have said.	If you wish, you may cauterize it down to the bone with an edged cautery so that the ends of the artery be divided; for this will replace that operation.	0.6142127
Except if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, because cauterization helps to destroy moisture, so it is more effective in benefit.	It is in fact better, as we have said, unless the patient is feverish or of a hot constitution; cauterization is one of the means of eliminating humidities, so it will be of surer efficacy.	0.74717987
It is necessary after severing the arteries to stuff the place with worn cotton and place tight bandages on it.	After extraction of the arteries the place must be packed with teased-out cotton wool, and on top of that must be put firm pads.	0.8622638
And after the resolution, treat it with dry medicines that grow flesh and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.	And after loosening the ligature, dress with dry medicaments that encourage growth of flesh, and with bandages,, till it heals.	0.79146576
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, immediately cut it either by cauterization or fill the place with vitriol and tighten your hand until the bleeding stops. If none of that is available to you, put your finger until the blood clots. And wash the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and tighten it as necessary.	But if arterial bleeding hinders you in the course of your operation, hasten to stanch it either by cauterization or by filling the place with vitriol, compressing it with your hand till the blood stays; or, if you have nothing of this kind by you, put your finger on it till the blood clots and rinse over the place till the flow dies down; then tie off as you should.	0.90451086
And what is lighter and easier than severing the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink and applying it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vessel is cut in two places so that the space between its ends widens. For it will not heal with this cauterization at all.	Less serious and easier than excising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this cautery provided with two blades, having first marked both places with ink. Bring it down, very hot, till it reaches the bone and the artery is cut in two places, so as to put some distance between the two ends, for it will certainly not unite after this cauterization.	0.8823998
And this is the image of the cautery:	This is the form of the cautery.	0.51812005
The sharpness of the two knives resembles the two small intestines, except that they are much less sharp than the knife, because if they were as sharp as the knife, the cold would reach them faster and the meat would not be cut quickly.	It should have two sharp blades like two small paring-knives, but they should be much less sharp than a knife, for if they are as sharp as a knife they will quickly lose their heat and the flesh will be slow in cutting.	0.82352936
So if there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will be retained in them, and they will cut the meat quickly.	If they have a certain thickness in them the heat of the fire will be retained in them and they will speedily cut the flesh.	0.90559196
And this method is better than any other method, lighter, and easier.	This operation is superior to all and less severe and easier.	0.7119409
And let the distance between the two knives be the thickness of a finger.	Let the distance between the two blades be the breadth of a finger.	0.86307013
