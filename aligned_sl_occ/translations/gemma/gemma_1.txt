O, children, know that I have finished this book for you, which is the latest of the science of medicine, by following your faith in me, by your demonstrations, and by your statements, so I have undertaken to explain to you this treatise, which is part of my art, that is surgery.
For our region and our times, surgery is a perilous art, so that the science of it is almost lost; and its vision is reduced to a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which change all things and bring about those errors and excesses that arise from a lack of understanding of it and from the lengthening of its forces and art
I know that I must explain this treatise in such a way that it follows the way of demonstration and statement, and of abbreviation; and that I must speak of the forms of the instruments of cautery and of other instruments of the work as well as for the addition of the declaration, and for the preparation of the patient, which is necessary.
The greatest cause why no good artisan can be found in our time for this surgery is that the art of medicine is long, and that it includes the exercise of the science of anatomy, which Gualius knew well in that he recognized the functions of the members and the forms of these, and the junction and separation of them; and the knowledge of bones, nerves and vessels, their number and their course, and their blood supply.
And thus speaks Hippocrates, who said that my name is nothing in the small work, but it is great in the art of the hand.
I have already told you in the introduction of this book that he who is not learned in anatomy will fall into error and cause the death of men, as I have often seen happen, for many are formed in this science and depart from it by this science and its experiments
For I have seen a foolish doctor who, having incisions in the groin of a woman, caused her to bleed to death by incising several arteries of the groin.
And I have seen another doctor who, having been deceived by a stone in a man’s bladder which he had treated in its time, when it grew large, went to take it out with a piece of intestine, and the man died three days later
And I have often appealed in this way to extract it, and I have seen that because of the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient I knew that he would die of it.
I have seen another doctor who was taking care of a duke from our land for surgery, and he was deceived by a black sorcerer who had fractured his thigh; and although the doctor was aware of this, in his ignorance he extracted the fracture with sponges and bandages with great tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe air
And thus I have seen him discharge the patient according to his desires, and then relieve him, and then lie down with him for several days and commanded that he be left alone; and this happened until the thigh was loosened and the bone was fractured again, and he died of this.
I appealed to him and I saw that he discharged the liament, and he obtained tranquility and was relieved of his pain.
But indeed corruption was already confirmed in the limb, for he could not restrain it, and he did not cease to spread corruption in the limb until the patient was in danger of death
And I have seen another doctor who performed an incision for cancer, and he formed ulcers nearby several days later, while the cancer was growing greater than he had thought at first.
This is because cancer is pure melancholy humor, and it does not suffice for it to overcome it with all one’s force, but that one must also take care of the limb which suffers from it as from everything else.
Therefore, children, you must know that surgery must be divided into two parts: the part which is associated with health, and the part which is dangerous even in the greatest precautions.
And I have already spoken of this in all this book in the part where I speak of the operation in which there is error and fear; for you must know that it is necessary for you to guard against this and to leave that which is harmful, so that the fools do not find fault with you and you do not lose your credit
Therefore take courage and ask for the help of God in this work, and the sick with you in their suffering and weakness.
And use the best way for the grace of God to achieve salvation and praiseworthy success, and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and finally the arms of those who frighten you, so that you rest in your faith and in your name no should you be ashamed: for indeed it remains to your glory, and more so in heaven and after death among the saints
What has already been said in various places is this: “No treat any illness in vain, for so that no doctors will be disgraced”.
And I have already spoken of this book according to three chapters.
Let us begin the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter orders the parts of the foot, the forms of the instruments and the implements of the cautery, and what is necessary for the operation.</start_of_turn>
The division of the second part.</start_of_turn The second chapter deals with swelling and perforation, and veins, ulcers, and extraction of arrows, all of which are categorized and ordered in terms of the forms of the instruments.</start_of_turn
The third chapter deals with restoration and dislocation, and care of fractures and similar cases; the chapter is categorized from the parts of the foot and the forms of the instruments.</start_of_turn
And I have said what is the quality of the instruments of that cautery and the documents of them, and in what completion it is prohibited to perform cautery.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that the speech about the quality of the instruments of the cautery and their documents is a long and profound speech, subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and many learned men have spoken greatly of it, and they have disagreed among themselves, and I believe that little of what they have said is true.
Therefore I say that the cautery conforms to all universal completion except for two compliances, which are the compliances of the matter or its matter.</start_of_turn
In the cold and dry compliance of the matter or its matter, disagreement arises; for some say that the cautery is useful in that, while others say the opposite, that the cautery is not suitable for cold and dry ailments because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient for ailments that are cold and dry to be treated with fire and dryness.</start_of_turn
And I say that those who say the opposite are wrong, that the cautery is useful in all cold and dry ailments that exist in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of the air to the compliance of the fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this speech that I have already experienced several times that it is discovered to me.</start_of_turn
However, I do not say that everything that has been said about cautery in this chapter is new or unexercised; and I know the diversity of the humors of men and the condition of their ailments, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the passage of time concerning these.</start_of_turn
However, in other compliances, it is not about you to be afraid, and especially in cold and wet ailments, for it is already known by all doctors that these are suitable for the use of the cautery, and they do not disagree about the usefulness of the cautery in these.</start_of_turn
And you know, children, that the secret of healing with fire and the goodness of it is that of cautery with burning medicine, for the fire is simple, and its action reaches only the part that is cauterized and does not affect the other part that is adjusted to it except for a small document.</start_of_turn
For the action of burning medicine reaches only that part of the limb from which it is applied, and it makes it come out very difficult in the diseased limb and makes it very useful.</start_of_turn
For fire, by its subtlety and its substance, does not do anything other than what is necessary; and we already know it from experience and from the length of our service in the study of the art of truth about the causes; and for this reason I excuse myself for the length of this speech, for it is not appropriate for me to reveal the secrets of fire to you, which are the quality of the operation of the fire in the limbs and the expulsion of the disease by the fire, as is demonstrated in philosophical terms, unless it be for the most learned men.
And you know, children, that they disagree about the time when it is convenient to perform cautery and when it is best to wait.
And I say that cautery is useful at all times, so that for any sudden pain it is immersed in the juice that is applied to it, which is more so if the cautery is for pains or for necessary pains, strong and violent, which do not suffer from delay so that it is feared of those who come with malice, which is greater than a slight discomfort coming at the right time.
And I say that one should not neglect other diseases, or fools, for those who do not esteem anything except the vulgar people and the fools are not the doctors of that disease which is healed by cautery, so it is not ridiculous at all times, and they cease when that consequence has happened.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not that they say it is because they consider it, for cautery is nothing but a means of medicine that alters the complexion and dries out the humors which are the cause of these pains.</end_of_turn>
More importantly, however, cautery surpasses medicine in value and virtue for the excellence of its operation and the greatness of its efficacy.</end_of_turn
And it is possible that your disease will return at some time, according to the complexion of the disease and the location of the disease, and the virtue of them, and what is prepared in the body of the patient from the accumulation of superfluities in them, and what is obtained by them in their acquisition from foods and drinks; but that the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in a few superfluities and humors, just as if it were cautery of a tooth for pain and as much as in that, perhaps that pain will not return in them, even though it is made small.</end_of_turn>
And it may be said vulgarly that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and is a magical remedy, not as those understand it, for they grow up thinking that it is not a cure that makes use of either medicine or any other cause except for cautery.</end_of_turn
And the cause is contrary to this; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when they administer the methods of treatment in certain diseases, and those medicines do not heal, and at the end of the cause they administer manes cautery, and they take advantage of that.</end_of_turn And I say that it is not true that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, according to the understanding which the vulgar people and the fools of the doctors have.</end_of_turn
And I say that the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and I do not say anything but for the equality of gold and the fineness of its substance.</end_of_turn
And I say that the place of cautery does not make it bad, as it is not absolutely true, for I have already seen that it does not do anything but in some cases where other things do not work, and that cautery with gold is better than with iron as they say; however, when you make cautery with fire from gold, it is not your business to declare that, for it is ignited according to the quantity that you want for the roughness of the gold, and you must prepare to receive it cold; and if you mix it with the fire it will melt the gold for the fire, and if there are some plates in the fire that the artificer cuts for the occupation of that.</end_of_turn
And for this reason cautery with iron must be done more gently and more cautiously in the direction of the operation.</end_of_turn
I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those of the head among the feet, so that I may satisfy the one who demands from me what he wants from me.</end_of_turn
The first chapter.</end_of_turn>
This cauterization confers to cold and humidity about the accidental cause of which these two causes do, so it is the cause of soda and multiple fluxes of the rheumatic kind, applied to the cortex, from the head to the parts of the limbs and the heels fluent, and multiple sleep, and toothache and headache, and universally of all diseases that come from cold, even as paralysis, sodomia and apoplexy, and it remains in those diseases.</end_of_turn
The form of this cauterization is as follows: first of all command the patient to be evacuated with laxatives with medical liquor for three or four nights, according to how much you increase the virtue of the disease and the age of it and its custom.</end_of_turn
And then command him to shave his head with a razor, and do that between his thighs on a fallen bench and that he put his hands on his feet.</end_of_turn
And then pause the shaving of your palm near the swelling between the knuckles of your hands.</end_of_turn May it be so, whenever the physician testifies concerning the location of the pain, that is to say, when the area which is affected is tensed, then immediately ignite the cautery with olive oil of this kind.
And immediately suspend that above the area which is affected, in such a way that it descends gradually, with which the hand of the physician is constrained little by little, and you will rotate that.</end_of_turn>
And immediately lift your hand slightly and hold the area, and if you see already some part of the bone to be exposed any quantity whatever, thus as much as the quantity of barley grains, then elevate your hand, and if you do not turn your hand towards that bone, towards the other, if it is cold, enter until it is seen from the bone that you have said.</end_of_turn>
And immediately take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and keep it there for three days.</end_of_turn>
And immediately suspend over the heel in the border and keep it there until the scar of the fire is destroyed.</end_of_turn> And immediately care for the area with four medicines until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And indeed I say that when the plague remains open, better get the brace, because it is better and more healing.</end_of_turn>
I say to you all that the bone must be cauterized until it reaches the bone, and must be held there until every part of the substance of the bone is consumed.</end_of_turn
And immediately let that be scraped away which remains adhering to the bone, and immediately let it be cured.</end_of_turn
And I say that it must be cauterized until it reaches the heel, within which the bone is firmly fixed, and that is the way of allaying it little by little.</end_of_turn And it is estimated that from that area vapor escapes from the head.</end_of_turn
And if the plague remains open for a long time, and immediately let it be cured when it is consolidated.</end_of_turn
I do not see these two kinds of cautery in all my life, except in reckless people by way of fear; and leave that, you must know, is better for health, when it is; for the head is developed by the solution of the continuity of these very things, as we have testified in other members, and more when the head of the patient is of a cold nature.</end_of_turn
And the first kind of cautery is better and more healing, you must know; and from that one and from this work comes health.

Of the cautery of the head.
When in all the head chronic pain occurs lasting a long time and when it is prolonged in the disease, and you use poultices and cushions and pillows and plasters and mustard and vinegar and garlic and ginger and rosemary, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery that they tell of and that does not benefit it from any of those causes, then consider that if the head of the disease is of strong formation in its nature; and it is not cold and finds little heat, then it must be cauterized with another cautery, leaving a little space. And immediately cauterize that over the heel bone until the bone is split. Incise the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted and cauterize that with a cautery on the posterior part of the head in the area where wind is stopped. And rest your hand in this way, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease by that means finds great pain other than the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.</end_of_turn>
I say that this cautery in its place, that covers that which has to be cauterized with the one with which we cauterize the heels and the back of the head is more subtle than that with which we cauterize the middle part of the head; and this is its way.</end_of_turn
End of text
Of the archaic cautery of the emigrants.</end_of_turn>
When there is severe pain in the part of the head, or widespread pain throughout the heel, evacuate with medicines the head that is made stiff, and administer the other care that I have mentioned in the preceding diseases; and all this without profit, for the cautery in them is done in two ways: either with acute medical combustion or with a needle.</end_of_turn
Better is the cautery with medical combustion than that with a needle, for you take a spoonful of alum, you wash that and expel the extremities from both heads.</end_of_turn And immediately prick the area of pain in the temple with a lancet that remains in the flesh until the pain ceases, until it is hidden.
And press above it to stop the constriction, leave it for three hours; then remove the ligature and draw out the pus, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and rest over it covered in broth until the pain subsides
And care for that which is affected until it is healed.
And if you wish, know that many medicines combat these which I have written in the aforementioned treatise on combat medicines
May the cautery be performed according to this manner: fire for cautery of which this is the form:
and it is called closed nails, in which the head of the nail is like a nail with any curvature, and in the middle of the nail there is a small prominence.</start_turn>
And rest over the area of pain, and hold your hand – so that the thread which is left will not adhere – and withdraw the fire little by little at speed.</start_turn
And if the amount which is adhered by the species of the bone is such that most of it, elevate your hand so that the artery which is left is not adhered, so that there is no obstruction of blood flow.</start_turn
And soak the wound in salt water and rest it over the area, leave it for three days; then rest the wound covered with butter, and care for it until it is healed.</start_turn
And if you wish, cauterize at the extremity of the cuticle according to the cautery, and keep you away from incision of the artery in this manner especially not antiquated.</start_turn
Chapter four.</start_turn>
Of cautery of antiquated embolism.</start_turn
When you have cured the embolism as we have said of the preceding cure, and as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and do not profit from the cure, and sometimes for the disease that does not reach it as we have said of the first cautery with medicine or of the cautery with fire, when you have kindled the cautery nail until it is white, because it signifies over the area of pain along the line of length of which is the majority of the finger, or what is more; withdraw your hand for a while and press that until you have incised the artery and arrived at the bone.</start_turn
But it is necessary for you to guard the continuity of the mandible, which is unlucky for biting, and that the thread not be adhered and the nerves which are bad in this, and that it does not suffer spasm.</start_turn
And if it is about the custody and care of the flow of blood of the artery that is cut, which in the cutting is a fear, and above all to that one who ignores what is done and is not studied and is reckless; leave the operation to him at the beginning.</start_turn
And I come to remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood in case of an accident of the artery according to the usual manner, in the usual place of this book.</start_turn
And if you see this disease that does not benefit from this cautery and see the body of the patient tolerable, cauterize that in the middle part of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it is healed.</start_turn
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter of the stretching of the artery with two nails, and this is a better cautery and more comfortable.</start_turn
Chapter five.</start_turn
Of cautery of the pains of the heel.</start_turn
When in the heel there is pain due to cold and it is cured by means of lacative causes and by another cure which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then immediately prick the area of pain with a lancet that remains in the flesh until the pain ceases, until it is hidden.</start_turn
And immediately prick around the area of pain, and let the fire go around the whole heel as if it were a wheel, or in the circumference of some vessel if the pain is in some place.</start_turn Slowly withdraw the fire from the edge of the heel a little at a time as you see that it has reached the area.
And if the cautery has reached ten points all around the heel, and what is more, care for the wounds until they are healed.</start_turn
Capitol .vi.
Capital six.
The sixth degree of cautery.
Avoid cautery of the species that must be dry or for spasm of the nerves.
When you have cured that species of tumor with herbs and capitula and unguaria, and you have finished your treatment, then cover that you are cauterizing the patient with three cauteries: the first you must make on the root of the nail, the second a little further from the middle, and the third on the juncture of two lips.
And pause the cautery on the side of the painful part, because excessive cautery can only be done on the part that appears to be well.
And the way of cautery is that you cauterize that which is around the nail at the root of the toe somewhat above the root of the nail, and in the middle another, the length of which is according to the length of the finger, and stop your hand with the cautery until the quantity of the matter of the species of the code has been consumed.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is the species of the curette, the form of which is like a table More importantly, do not make the burn too deep; and cover that you do not burn too much.
And then care for the area around the burn until it is healed.
Capital seven.
Of cautery of old apoplexy.
When the apoplexy is old and you have cured that which we have said, and do not confer your medicine, and the patient does not have fever, then cauterize that with four cauteries: over all the nails of the foot; at the edge of the nail and the middle of the head, as we have said; and on the gums And the manner of the cautery is sufficient as we have said
And it is already cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is better later; and then treat with what proceeds.
Capital eight
Of cautery for effective oblivion of pain by flame
Cover that the patient is given at the beginning large herbs and pills that serve to moderate.
And then touch the whole body of the patient and pause their tongues from their teeth with the plaster described in the treatise of plasters
And pause any herbs, because that is the manner of cautery And do this as we have already said.</start_of_turn>
And thus if for those who are well it is good; and if not, then do three cauteries on the back of the foot, which are dependent on the greater part of the head from the greater part of the heel. And pause between each cautery the thickness of the finger, and then treat the burn with what proceeds.
More if you are addicted and the patient is well-tolerating, then do the cautery in the middle of the head; and if you want more addiction, then cauterize that over the two nails.
Then care for that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive oil as it is said to be done in the manner that is taught
Capital nine
Of cautery of nails and of the mollification of all the body
Cover that you process in the moderation of the head with herbs and as we have said; and then touch the head of the patient, and then cauterize that which is cauterized in the middle of the head, and over all the nails of the head, and over the back of the neck, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the spine
And if it is necessary in the disease of the mollification of the body of the tropics that the patient is well-tolerating and the disease is strong, then do four cauteries over the vertebrae of the buttocks, and then do the cautery until it is consumed by the matter of the code, and remove the hand. And then care for that until it is healed, and this is olive oil
Capitol .x.
Capital .x.
It is not cauterized for epilepsy, but that which is for spasm.
And therefore we modify the head of the patient at the beginning and towards the end of treatment, and for the other cure which we have dictated in the division when the disease is great and tolerates the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not suffer from medicines, then administer safeguards and masticators, giving him this for several days, for the good of the diet
Then remove the head of the disease, and cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head according to the preceding manner, and at another cautery in the occiput of the head, and over each corner of the head wherever you cauterize And if the disease is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize that which we have said, having paralyzed and softening the body over the vertebrae of the belly and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the olive tree be cauterized as it is preceded.
Maybe if the disease is a child, pause the cautery superficially according to this manner.
Capital .xi.
From cautery of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and great heat, then cauterize that which we have said which has paralysis
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive flow declining into melancholy, and the body of the patient is humit, then give him to drink that which softens the head of the patient as it has been said in the division
Then remove the head of the disease, and make a decent burn with a loop on the circle, and withdraw that which is in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be made to lie down, and should be kept entirely still
And apply liniment; and it is more worthy to border around from sheep. And bandage that over the fire for moderate heat, which says that it suffers when it is more in it. And bring that which is in the middle of the head in the circle, and keep it until it is inflamed.
And give the patient to drink every day a meal, and the other remedies of the good things which are not harmful; or if you will, cauterize that which makes little points according to the most of them, but do not have the hand with a cautery in such order: this is the kind of cautery which moistens the head equally.
And remove that tumor surrounded in fat or in gray of grease.
Capital .xii
From the cautery of water descending in the groin
When you are told at the beginning of the water in the groin for the coughs which I have said in the division, then begin and give to drink the patient that which modifies the head of the patient, and keep him away from all humors.
And make him sweat in bath for a few days.
And command him to shave his head, and cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head; and cauterize that which is two cauteries over two temples if it is the beginning of the evacuation of water in two groins, or one palm if it is the beginning of the water in one groin
Burn all the veins and arteries which are left behind the cord; and cauterize them in that length in the breadth of the temples.
And keep away from fluxes of urine when it is cauterized; and if you see that the urine fluxes, stop any medicine which is to you possible
And I come to know the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and in the extirpation of those and care for the fluxes of urine.
And many veins are cauterized at the root leaving two bones with two cauteries which are produced immediately.
Capital .xiii
From the cautery of ancient tears
When tears of the eyes are ancient and remain on the veins and arteries that are manifested in the head, it is verified that these are superfluous free fatty substances. Therefore, cauterize that point which we recounted in the beginning of this treatise concerning the inflammation caused by cold water in the thighs, and that point in the middle of the head and two cauteries in the nape of the neck, leaving two temples, and two cauteries in the nape of the neck leaving two bones. And if the pain persists, then cauterize that area around the heel on the outer side of the ankle with a small burn.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XIV.</end_of_turn>
Of cauterization for foot pain.</end_of_turn
When your medicine does not suffice for what we have said in the division and does not profit from your medicine, then you shall appear and give to the patient three nights' food; and bring him close to his head, and cauterize that point which we mentioned before concerning olive oil.</end_of_turn And cauterize that point which is at the nail with two cauteries on the two ankles so that the hair is slightly cut.</end_of_turn
And take care that you do not burn the surrounding area.</end_of_turn
This is the way to cauterize the nail.</end_of_turn
Chapter XV.</end_of_turn
Of cauterization for the inflammation of the eyelids of the eyes.</end_of_turn
When the eyelid of the eye is inflamed by disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a burn like this.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize that area around the two eyebrows with a small burn using two cauteries in its entirety, and make them extend from the temples.</end_of_turn And the length of each burn should be according to the amount of hair.</end_of_turn
And do not press too much your hand with the burn, but according to the amount that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVI.</end_of_turn
Of cauterization of the eye when the eyelashes turn into drops and stick to the eye.</end_of_turn
When the eyelashes of the eye are turned into drops and stick to the eye, cauterize in these two ways, either with burn or with a burning medicine.</end>
If you burn them with fire, command the patient to keep his eyes open until the eyelashes are relaxed and equal; and if you use a cautery, hold those parts firmly with a bandage so that they are not scorched until the eyelashes are born anew.</end>
When they are born anew and equal, then pause the patient's head in the chest, and bring your hand over the eye of the patient with your thumb, as with the sign of the laurel leaf, and that is the beginning of the sign at the edge of the eyelashes.</end
And hold your hand steady with a bandage of wool or in egg white on the eye.</end
And do this with the burn.</end>
And cauterize over the figure you have signed, little by little, in greasy streaks, until the surface of the hair is as it is when the laurel leaf is burned throughout.</end
The sign of the completion of the work is that you see the eye of the patient already contracting and the eyelashes raised beyond the puncture of the eye.</end
And therefore lift your hand and leave it there for three days, and keep your hand over the eye border until the scab has subsided.</end And take care of that until it is healed.</end
But if it returns for any reason, command him to keep his eyes closed and the eye is inflamed, then do the burn again over that whole area as you did at the beginning.</end
But if the eyelashes are on the edge of the eye, then cauterize that until it is raised to its natural place and is equal, and that the eyelashes do not touch the eye.</end
But this is done with burning medicine, for which you command the patient to keep his eyelashes closed until they are relaxed and equal, and you use a piece of paper in the shape of a laurel leaf.</end<end_turn>
Then take a spoonful of wine and cause the living one to drink it up. Then take a spoonful of wine and make the patient drink it up. Then take a spoonful of wine and mix these things together, and make the patient drink it quickly so that it does not become cold; then expand the point which is causing the pain like a leaf of ivy, and place your hand over the area so that the point does not move; and keep the patient's head down in the basin of water, and the head of the patient should be at the level of the navel
And keep saying about the medicine and wait until the patient feels the benefit of the medicine, for the benefit is in them like fire.
And when you have seen that the patient feels the benefit of the medicine, then read the medicine and do not touch the patient again until you have said goodbye; and when the benefit has ceased, then remove the medicine and wash the point with water; and then consider whether the pupil is already lifted up like when washed by the friction of fire or incision, for this is good; and if not, do not touch the medicine again until the operation is complete and the patient has recovered
Then keep your hand over the area until the spasm of the pain has passed, and then care for the patient until he is deaf or otherwise recovered, until he is healthy
It is necessary for you to know that you must keep a watchful eye on the patient during the operation to ensure that the medicine does not cause any harm; and if the pupil becomes clouded for several days due to any cause of the points in the eye, then repeat the medicine on the area where the pupil is clouded, just as you did at the beginning, and continue until the patient is healthy
This is the way of making a ivy leaf shape.
You know that the humors of the body are diverse in size and quantity, and therefore according to this is how your contraction is effective.
Do not be ashamed of the way to proceed in this art
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Of cautery for a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.</start_of_turn>
When you are treating the fistula and you do not confer the cure, then you must take care that you cauterize in this way: command the patient to keep their head down and hold their head between their thighs in such a way that it does not move or shake the head cap
And then keep the point immersed in water or in mucus on the eye
And then take the cautery of this shape:
which is pointed, like a cane or a spiral, from one extremity to the other of the point that is causing the pain
And if you wish, penetrate through to the other extremity And if you wish, come out in this way like an attempt
Better is the work that is perfect than that which is superficial
And then close the fistula if it is open, and bring it back to health and dry that. And if it is not open, then open it and remove the purulent matter from it.</start_of_turn>
And then keep your hand over the area that has been cauterized so that it is well ignited, and put a little of the cautery on the point of the nose, so that you do not move your hand or that the patient becomes restless, and then remove the cautery from the gray matter of the eye and soothe that.</start_of_turn>
And if at the beginning of the treatment the cautery has entered the bone, it is not good; and if so, repeat the cautery several times, if necessary; and leave that for three days, and then keep your hand over the area around the point and send it away until it is healthy
If even after passing twenty days it is not healthy, then keep the acute corrosive medicine away until the bone is uncovered and is rough as you deem appropriate in the chapter above.</start_of_turn
And another way of cauterizing a fistula is as follows: enter the point of the fistula and open that, and then keep your hand over that crease that is the shape of it: and pour in the quantity of wine that is appropriate; and hold your hand firmly in place without causing any discomfort to the patient, so that the wine does not reach the eye; and keep your hand over the eye well covered in water or in vinegar, because the wine will adhere to the point of the fistula and heal it miraculously.</start_of_turn
If the fistula has healed with the cautery and dressing, it is good; otherwise, it is necessary to administer medicine through the nose and reduce the fistula to the root of the nose as needed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>

The blisters that appear on the lips are usually caused by excessive eating of fats, and especially in children.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when you have cured those wounds with the medicine that we have mentioned in the divisions, and you do not take advantage of your care, then it is necessary to cauterize a little further according to this manner:</start_of_turn
And the curvature of the area according to the hardness of the tissue.</start_of_turn
Then place your hand over that area deliberately over those wounds until the cautery reaches the bottom of the wounds.</start_of_turn

When there is swelling of the uvula or the palate or the teeth roots, and there is pus, and it breaks, and it is evacuated, and there remains pus, and there is a fistula, and you do not take advantage of the treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula according to the amount that has been received in the fistula. And put that flame in the medicine of the fistula, and keep your hand over it until the flame reaches the bottom of it, and after that make some space with a needle or two. And take care of that until it is cured.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if the abscess is opened and is cured, it is good; otherwise, it is necessary to uncover the bone and remove the pus according to what will be said in the chapter.</start_of_turn

When the veins are softened by humidity and the teeth are decayed, and you do not trust them, then put your hand over the patient's belly and take away the cause of the pain, and then cauterize the area in the shape that you will be told. Keep your hand over the area until the wound has closed.
And remove your hand, and cauterize several times as you wish.</start_of_turn
And give the patient plenty of salt water to rinse their mouth and keep it for an hour, and then remove it, for the decayed tooth is stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the moisture that was corrupted is dried up.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXI.</start_of_turn
Of cautery for toothache.</start_of_turn
When the toothache is due to cold, or if it is cold or warm, or if you do not trust the treatment with medicine, then it is necessary to cauterize in two ways: either by cautery with vinegar or by cautery with fire.</start_of_turn
The border is taken with vinegar and placed in the palm of the hand, and the thumb is wrapped around the extremity of the tentacle, and it is dipped into that vinegar and placed over the aching tooth immediately until it is cool.</start_of_turn
And do that several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn
Or if you wish, immerse a sponge or cloth in the vinegar and place it over the aching tooth, and place the flame over that until the flame reaches the bottom of the cavity of the tooth.</start_of_turn
But the cautery with fire is more dangerous than that with vinegar, because you must be careful of the amount of charcoal or flame, and that it does not reach the mouth of the patient.</start_of_turn
And take away the flame when it is done, and place your hand over the area until the cautery is cool; and do that several times so that the pain will be gone or in that day or the next day.</start_of_turn
Therefore, after this cautery the patient must rinse their mouth with good vinegar and keep it for an hour, and then remove it.</start_of_turn
Burn with the cautery wherever you deem necessary according to your skill.
This is the method of performing the cautery.

When ulcers are caused by cold humors that do not yield to medication and you wish to digest them slightly, then ignite the cautery as follows: grasp two extremities so that the smoke from the cautery does not reach the other, and place the thumb of your other hand over the sore spot until the ulcer has healed.</start_of_turn
And if the ulcer is small, then keep the cautery away from the area in proportion to the size of the ulcer. Leave it for three days and cover the area with a bandage until the part that the fire has consumed has healed.</start_of_turn

When the nipple is displaced due to greasy humidity and does not harden during the time of sexual intercourse, you must displace it again until it returns to its normal position. As we have learned, when this has happened, reduce the displacement first of all, and then reverse the sexual act on the two testicles or on the flanks of the scrotum; and elevate the testicles that are in the lower part of the nipple towards the testicles on the left side, if the joint is displaced towards the lower parts.</start>
And take two cauteries; this is how you do them:</start_of_turn
And cauterize the scrotum until it penetrates the other side; the shape of the cautery will be like that of four cauteries.</start_of_turn
And each groove is adjusted according to this count and because there are eight cauteries.</start_of_turn
And take salt around the cauteries for a while, and make the patient rest peacefully, and do not move the limb for any time until it is comfortable.</start_of_turn
If dislocation is at the distal and proximal ends, then it is usually called gout. Therefore cauterize over the muscle at the base of the thumb or over the area of the dislocation, until the joint is stabilized and the moisture is evacuated and the pain is gone.
When dislocation is at the lower and upper parts, then it is commonly called gout. Therefore cauterize over the muscle at the base of the thumb or over the area of dislocation, until the joint is stabilized and the moisture is evacuated and the pain is gone.

When there is pain in the heel due to cold, moisture, or excessive wind, that is, when the natural shape of the heel is displaced by excessive swelling, and if you do not confirm that the pain has gone, then it is necessary to make three incisions as we have said and as much as desired on the heel of the foot from below the hip bones, without damaging the heel bone itself.
And the space between each incision should be according to the size of the toe, and the incisions should be as long as the limb is wide.

When there is extrusion or swelling of the heel and you want to know if that swelling is in the bone or in the membrane, if it is in the bone, the pain becomes greater and the swelling is more acute.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the membrane of the heel, the pain is acute and often the doctors are already exhausted in caring for it.</end_of_turn
Therefore let the pain be supported on the cervix of the heel; and note the place of the swelling with a needle; and cauterize the area that is like a rag, as it has been described before.</end_of_turn And burn with that cautery until all the wound is covered, until it reaches the hip bone, until it is completely healed.

And immerse that in oil and bring that to the fire, and burn for a cautery in that place where there is between the continuation of the collarbone and the ribs; and with two small cauteries let them guide, one slightly declining towards the part that is below the beard, and two cauteries that are declining between the fifth rib and the twelfth, declining slightly towards the back; and another cautery in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cauteries on the back; and one cautery in that place where there are two buttocks, and two cauteries on the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery that is between two buttocks.</end_of_turn
And do not cover your hand over the cautery, but rather on the manifestation of the wound that is being worked on.</end_of_turn

Of the burning of the heel.</end_of_turn
When you have cured the disease of the heel as we have said in the division, and you do not refer your care, then the way to burn in it is in three ways, which are all safe: one is to make three or four incisions according to the length of the heel, following the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figure of which has preceded.</end_of_turn
And between each cautery let there be the thickness of a finger or a little more, and the method of cautery is the one that we have said in the cauteries of the foot equally.</end_of_turn
And do not cover your hand over the cautery; and the disease is even over the heel two.</end_of_turn
And another way to burn is to ignite the cautery with two burners, which causes we have said in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the heel that is at the bottom of the heel bone so that the heel does not stay in the left-hand side of the disease.</end_of_turn
And let your elevation be such as to elevate the heel according to the length of the limb, so that the cauteries are made according to the width of the body.</end_of_turn
And bring together the two burners, ignite them, in that place where the other penetrates the heel of the other part.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus there are four cauteries made.</end_of_turn

Do not evacuate the patient from the cautery until it has cooled down, as it may cause them to feel additional pain, and do not move them until assistance arrives.
The shape of the cautery that should be used to cauterize the belly is the claw, as it is the shape of that which has gone before, and that which should be used to cauterize the two olives is the olive, as it is the shape which has gone before its shape.

It is cauterized in this way: and do two cauteries on the two sides of the area, and in any case do the cautery at the edge of the cautery cut And the cautery should be of the length of the thigh: leave the nail of the thumb and the other below the middle of the thigh; and do two cauteries on each thigh

Capitol .xli.
Capital .xli.
When pain is in the ankle, and it is caused by cold and humid air, the disease is cured by that which we have said and do not confer, and when it has been cured, the hour comes that you must remove from the disease the humors which cause it with solid pills or artificial pills or something similar; and do the cautery of that.
And the way of making the cautery in this case is in two ways: either with medicinal means that fight, or with fire.
Thus according to two scientific ways, of which one is that which cauterizes that on the ankle with three triangular cauteries as follows; and do it with a good depth.</start_of_turn> And let the space between each cautery be as much as the thickness of the finger and if there is olive oil or grease.
May some see that the cautery is made over the middle area over the ankle because there are four cauteries.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, cauterize around the circle which precedes the shape in the cautery of dislocation of the ankle, and that it be a continuous circle and burn the spiciness of all the tendon.</start_of_turn
And this is the way of cautery in the sciatica when the pain is adherent to the ankle and is not extended to the cavity.</start_of_turn
And if it is extended to the cavity, the hour is that you cauterize that with two cauteries on the cavity on the area where you sent the disease that is the pain; and one cautery on the heel for four fingers a little away from the wrist.</start_of_turn
And if the cautery is tough, and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the spiciness of the tendon.</start_of_turn
And if the disease sends that the pain is extended to the area below the foot, the hour is that you cauterize that here where you sent with the cautery for three points or four or more if you wish of that.</start_of_turn
And if the disease sends that the pain has left the area of the thigh, the hour is that you cauterize that here with a tough cautery.</start_of_turn
And keep in all the cautery that you do not finish with the cautery while you burn nerves or great vessels, and that for that is over the disease neither damage nor contraction.</start_of_turn
And I have already seen that some cauterize on the heel and finish with the cautery, and the limb is swollen until the tumor has reached the foot, and the limb is perforated and corrupted throughout.</start_of_turn And immediately apply a strong solution of vinegar, and immediately do the death.</start_of_turn
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each one according to this manner.</start_of_turn
And say the wise men of the cautery of the ankle that the cautery should be like a circle of iron whose circumference is that of half a palm; and that it should be deep like the seed of an olive or less.</start_of_turn
And draw that circle a third time; and let the space between them be as much as the thickness of a hair; and these circles must be closely bound to each other; and let the length of these marks be one or two hairs, and make them in these marks of iron suitably dressed in the circles; and this is the form of them.</start_of_turn
And immediately ignite the fire until it is well consumed and gets sparks, and immediately place your hand over the area of the ankle, the disease resting on the heel of the foot.</start_of_turn And thus cauterize that with three cauteries around in a row.</start_of_turn
And immediately lay that for three days; immediately apply a dressing to that with border and leave the wound open for several days; and immediately care for that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Say Albucasis: or, friends, of this kind of cautery we have used little for the terror of the guard concerning it, and for that few have found that which are useful concerning it.</start_of_turn
May of the good cauteries for those who suffer from it, and find in that place of them.</start_of_turn
May the cautery with medicines that remain be more than that which you make with two circles having the opening perforated in which you put the nutmeg of the pepper; let the length of the thread in the neck of them be two nails or more like those.</start_of_turn
If there is space between the quantity of the thickness of the toe; and if they are opened leaving them suspended, and if they contain each other in this way:
If there is space between the quantity of the thickness of the toe; and if they are opened leaving them suspended, and if they contain each other in this way, then place your hand over the ankle joint and compress the hand over the ankle. Then take warm water and pour it between two circles. The quality of that should be like small fire. Keep that for the quantity of an hour. Suffer the pain of the ankle — for the pain is just like fire — until the pain stops.
And then lift your hand towards the instrument and wash the warm water from the whole ankle with cold water.
And then rest for three days and keep your hand on that border until the blackness of the swelling has disappeared. Then rest for a few days, and walk when you can. This is the ultimate treatment.
And then care for that until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or the groin, keep them in such a position that they contain water as is done in the ankle swelling
This is the method of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe for alkali and caustic that has not been extinguished from both parts, take one part of each, grind them together and place them in a new liquid from which the part that remains should be perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters into it.
And keep the other liquid of the liquid layer away from this liquid layer, and take from this alkali and caustic alive from warm water that you take for a thumb, and when you have grasped those with your thumb for a good compression, then rest what comes from the acute water in the part that remains from the liquid layer to the liquid layer.
And then adjust all that water, and take from another caustic alive and another alkali renewed, because that every hour that it remains without movement, the acute quality is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, for that operation is like fire.
And so of the many medicines with which cauterization is done widely, some are like vinegar and tamarind and caustic with sulfur that are mixed together.
And thus it is recounted of an ancient man the operation and care with which pain of the ankle and sciatica is cured, and he magnifies it more than enough, and says that no other care is necessary, and that he is healed in a few days as it is recommended, for that heat that remains from that treatment is enough in itself.
And it is that it is close to certain herbs green, and if it is not found green, take recent figs; and do not grind it with many grains, but rather bind it with a little flour and place it on the ankle where the pain is, or in the thigh or groin, and bind it
And let it rest for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the pain of the swelling allows.
And then put that in the bath and when the body of it is bruised, take it out of the sun, for the pain ceases and it is healed.
And know that it does not suffice that some use of cautery with these medicines, but rather the evacuation of the body.
Moreover I say that when there is a wound of a goat the stretica vein is cauterized, take advantage of that well; and make the cautery like this: take wool and soak it in oil against inflammation, and place it between the toes of the foot and between the heel bones
And then take a dry wound of a goat and fill that with fire until it is black; and then put that on the wool and rest until it is stretched out. And do that again, and do not stop until the sensation of the pain disappears within the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of calves.

Of cauterization of two pains.</end_of_turn>
Some vegetable matters cause pain in the two together, as for example by bruise or by blow or by excessive evacuation, and for such causes as these, by infusion of hot and humid matter.</end_of_turn
And cautery does not suffice for anything other than this single kind which is useful for the effusion of hot matter.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover, immediately evacuate the evil from the belly with pills fitting and resembling them, that they may be effective over the two in which the pain is three lines according to the latitude of them, since they have no tendency in any line or cauterize or may, according to the quantity of the tolerance of the evil and the virtue of them.
And let the cautery be effective at the point of the puncture.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or with four at the middle cleft according to this manner:</end_of_turn>
(The text continues with instructions for performing the cautery procedure.)</end_of_turn>
From the beginning of the cautery until the swelling subsides.</end_of_turn
Girls who have just begun their illness should be kept warm; and a sign of the beginning of their illness is that they experience stiffness in their limbs and elevation and movement decrease.</end_of_turn
And in the rear is the response of the two and the neck of the illness that already begins to overcome the other vertebrae.</end_of_turn
And therefore when you are sometimes there and you wish to forbid, then let the cautery be at the point that is circular according to this manner:</end_of_turn that it covers the whole part of the vertebra equally.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with two point punctures or three.</end_of_turn And let the punctures be close to each other.</end_of_turn
Then take care of the area within that it is healthy with the water that we have said.</end_of_turn>
Beware that the cautery is not administered in swelling that is useful for nerve spasm.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with further instructions and precautions for the cautery procedure.)</end_of_turn
On cautery for gout and joint pain.</end_of_turn
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</end_of_turn
And therefore gout caused by cold is cured by means of treatment and not by remaining of the pain, for the pain remains after the cautery.</end_of_turn
And that you cauterize immediately the evacuation around the joint of the foot with multiple cauteries.</end_of_turn
And let the cautery be like olive oil, which is the form of it.</end_of_turn
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</end_of_turn And if the pain goes up into the bones or to the other joints, and when the evil has passed away, then let you cauterize over each bone with three cauteries or over the whole area with this olive oil cautery.</end_of_turn
And if more than these cauteries are necessary, then let you cauterize that and do not touch your hand too much with the cautery beforehand, even though you send the speculum away.
And if the pain goes up into the bone of the heel, then let you administer the cautery that we have said in the previous chapter.</end_of_turn
And if the pain is only in the most only place, and is called urgently, then let you puncture around the nails as if they were reversed, and puncture in those two lines.</end_of_turn
And if there remains any pain in these places, then let you puncture around the nails over each bone and over the edge of the hand.</end_of_turn
And if the pain comes close to the joints or the muscles, then let you cauterize the whole parts of the helpers.</end_of_turn
Do not evacuate the evil without good regimen and reception of medicines, for if it is well-regimented and inflamed, it is evacuated with this cautery without harm, God helps.</end_of_turn
(The text continues with concluding remarks and blessings.)</end_of_turn>
On cautery for fractures.</end_of_turn
When there is a fracture in the limbs and saying the bones breaking to the heel, and when the evil begins to approach, then let you cover that you order the patient to leave his food in the morning and use soft causes so that the wound comes away from the belly.</end>
And now follow the disease between your thighs towards the groin, and command them to hold the groin inward until the swelling subsides or the hernia or bulge disappears.
And thus return the point which we have marked and seal it with the attempt to break the bone at the heel and signal the extremity which is like a great circle from the heels of the body.</end_of_turn>
And thus we cauterize the point whose shape is like that.</end_of_turn
Until it is neither red nor black.</end_of_turn> Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</end_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</end_of_turn
And now pause the cautery upon that signal which is in your hand, and when you have cauterized until you have reached the middle of the heel; repeat the operation if you have not achieved it in the first attempt upon the heel.</end_of_turn
And observe diligently the color of the hernia at the time of your cautery, that you do not burn the hernia so that on the disease no comes an immediate death or other great harm.</end_of_turn>
And know that when you have cauterized do not touch the bone, do not confer your operation.</end_of_turn
And cover that the cautery of children is subtle according to the great and the measure of them.</end_of_turn
And take care of the place of the cautery for three days with borders so that the burn is healed.</end_of_turn
And take care of those who remain sick until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And the disease is calm upon the groin for forty days until the place and the wound are sealed.</end_of_turn
And cover that you abstain from food for the length of the treatment of them which lines the belly of them, and that the hernia does not escape due to the effort to heal.</end_of_turn
And when the forty days are completed, then administer ointment properly made, and keep that for other forty days.</end_of_turn
Be attentive to work and to food and drink, and to harsh words, for when you use this regimen of treatment the entire woman will be cured.</end_of_turn>
I also say the treatment of ruptures in the other parts of the belly, and so from the beginning, and do not fear, when you cauterize the rupture of that point round according to its quantity; and that which is extruded from the belly just as the third part of it; and take care of that which we have said, and do not make it worse.</end>
And indeed I say at the first that the rupture must be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this fashion, because it is a sign with attempt.</end>
And it is stopped along the line which is beyond the width of the rupture, and another line below; and place your hand with a claw cautery, more the first cautery is more curious and better.</end
Forty-six.</end
Of cautery of hernia.</end>
When pain persists in various limbs for treatment or for percussion of pain and it persists for a long time and you do not relieve it with medicines, then cover that you cauterize with a pointed cautery.</end
And the cautery of the whole limb according to the magnitude and the smallness of it, and its force and development, and the location of the hernia and the pain of it.</end<end_turn>
Therefore if it is well done at the first cautery, it is not good; and if not, cover that you repeat it; for it is commonly known that those pains are caused by the puncture of the limb towards that limb, so that you must consider those which are at the puncture until the disease is healed.</end
Forty-seven.</end
Of cautery of leprosy.</end
The books many times make use of cautery for great benefit, and management if the kind of leprosy which is caused by putrefaction of fat and melancholy.</end<end_turn>
Therefore, when you wish to cauterize him, consider whether the leprosy is consuming and has not healed, or that it persists. Fear lest the corruption should encompass the whole body and all its perfection, for then cauterize him over the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and one at each side leaving them apart; one at the front of the hair and two at the back; and one at the back of the neck or shoulder.
And finally remove your hand from the cautery a a slight distance from the bone, so that scales are detached from it, in order that the exhalation of thick vapors is relieved from them; and cauterize on the heel as required.</end_of_turn>
And if the leprosy has already spread over the body and appears evident, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with those very cauteries which we said in the head; and cauterize on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheeks, and two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and six cauteries on the vertebrae of the thorax, and one large one on the vertebrae near the navel, and one on the navel itself, and two on the ankles, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of the thighs; and cauterize him over all the joints of the hands and feet, and over every nail of the toes, and over the follicles of his hair.
And take care that you do not burn the nerves that are on the heel so that you do not damage them.</end_of_turn>
And many veins are cauterized with one cautery on the bone of the heel and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel.
Remember that the more cauteries you make, the more useful and effective it will be; and remember that the patient does not feel pain during the cautery, just as before, for the body is already stunned.</end_of_turn>
And cover that the cauteries are large or small according to the members and the joints as it is preceded by the nature of the instruments.</end_of_turn>
And take care of the cautery with flour of barley mixed with honey and with another care so that it should be healthy.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLVIII.</end_turn>
Of the cautery of stupor.</end_turn
When any limb is stiff or asleep and is cured with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that stiff limb with cauteries as it deserves the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it.</end_of_turn
And let the heel be cauterized slightly penetrating the stiffness of the heel a little.</end_of_turn And take care of it so that it should be healthy again.</end_of_turn
And many veins are cauterized each one of which is caused by the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the thorax and you can see the swelling of the nerves which are causing that limb, and it is appeased.</end_of_turn
Do not presume more than what is known about the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves throughout the body.</end_of_turn
Chapter XLIX.</end_turn
Of the cautery of carbuncles that are decaying.</end_turn
When carbuncles are old and do not yield to the touch of medicines, then you cauterize over that with a slight burn beforehand according to the quantity of the stiffness of the heel until the whiteness and the color of it are restored, and the color of it is changed.</end_of_turn
And take care of it with flour of barley and lentils with scented oil of rosemary and with ashes of columb or ashes of heron, give each one a little of everything and mix them all together, and apply it to the place with a bandage and hold it in place until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter L.</end_turn
Of the cautery of cancer.</end_turn
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove that limb, then you cauterize that with a circular burn around the circumference of it as it is swollen.</end_of_turn
And let the learned men know that it is cauterized with the last cautery in the middle; indeed I have not seen anything like it, for I believe that it is ulcerated, and I have already seen several veins.</end_of_turn
E es pus dreyturier que sia cauterizat in the circle of the limb as said before, or in a more extensive area.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
It is better to cauterize around the circumference of the limb as we have said before, or in a more extensive area.
When any part of the body is delayed in maturity, and this is due to excess fat or the state of the patient, who is old in decrepitude, frail, or suffering from a lack of strength, or for the time, and you wish to hasten the maturity of the part; then cauterize in the circumference of the limb without making numerous punctures; and thus you will force it to mature.
May be if you wish to perforate the limb with the cautery, then do so with the one whose form is that of the limb: and stop when you reach the middle of the part to be cauterized, so that you do not penetrate the bone
And if you cauterize in that place which is more distant, so that the limb is relieved; and take care of that which is within that is healthy
When any part of the body is delayed in maturity, and this is due to excess fat or the state of the patient, who is old in decrepitude, frail, or suffering from a lack of strength, or for the time, and you wish to hasten the maturity of the part; then cauterize in the circumference of the limb without making numerous punctures; and thus you will force it to mature.
When any part of the body is delayed in maturity, and this is due to excess fat or the state of the patient, who is old in decrepitude, frail, or suffering from a lack of strength, or for the time, and you wish to hasten the maturity of the part; then cauterize in the circumference of the limb without making numerous punctures; and thus you will force it to mature.
Corrodent is a mobile corruption of the limb, which consumes that as if with fire as it consumes dry wood
Therefore if sometimes that corruption is in the place where you suffer pain, then do you cauterize with the fire as with little nails, and as many as are necessary in that place where it is corrupted.
And thus cauterize throughout the area until you have eradicated all the corruption and there remains no cause of it
And thus leave it for three days, and rest over the cauterized places until three days have passed since the cautery, when the scabs have all disappeared and all the corruption has gone
And take care that no fat remains engendered
May be three times that the fat appears healthy in the place where there is no corruption, it is not so; but if not, then repeat the cautery over that which remains corrupted
And corruption is treated with various herbs in acute medicine, which is half as effective as the cautery May the fire cautery be more useful than any other remedy.
And I have already said the treatment of acute medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Of cautery of nails and of other similar things
The nails of the foot are often the cause of pain in the foot; and it is a great and frequent cause, which makes the foot lame; and the cautery is done in two ways, that is, with fire and with cold water
May the fire cautery be more useful than any other remedy.
And thus leave the fire alight on the nail, and immediately rotate your hand over the cauterized area of the nail until the cautery has reached the depth of the nail. And leave it for three days until the limb becomes healthy again. E aprop emplastre aquel am malvas salvatges trissadas am sal, e leyssa le emplastre sobre aquel per una nuoyt, quar aquel sira eradicat de las suas razitz.
Then keep the wound covered with a soft dressing until it has healed
If it does not improve, and black spots appear on the surface of the body, mostly on the palms and feet, then you must administer cold packs in those cavities. Take a piece of fleece or felt or leather, and place it over the wound; and pour a little cold water over it. Keep your hand over the wound and compress it with your hand all around, and press the edge of the wound against the bone. Keep the cold water flowing into the wound for a while. Then withdraw the cold water slowly, because the bone has become soft.
And so be it with those things and do the same with the rest of them until you are over all of them
And keep the wound covered until the root of the bone has been eradicated by the swelling of the surrounding parts

From the cautery of tremor
When there is an tremor due to cold in the nerves or from excessive heat, or from another similar cause, then you must cauterize the area around the four corners or over the vertebrae of both, between each vertebra with a cautery; and on the legs and over the stomach, with an olive oil cautery.
And the tremor will cease and the health of the feverish patient will be restored

From the cautery of burns accidentally caused to the body
When burns appear on the body, and black spots appear which are caused by corrupt thick matter; therefore it is necessary at the outset when they appear to cauterize over the head of the fistula with a fine needle and thread, the extremity of which is extended over the fire; or at the root of the long bones; or with a needle of small caliber
And some say that it is necessary to cauterize immediately at the beginning of their discharge following this manner; and do not be afraid, for it will be ruptured and the excess will be removed, and they will be healed of these things
However, it is necessary to evacuate with a tube through a fistula.
The text ends abruptly at this point and does not include the translated content of the remaining portion of the treatise
From the cautery of the flux of urine due to accidental incision of the artery.
Many times there is a urine fistula due to an incision of the plaque that must be debrided, or due to the incision of pus or cauterization of the limb, and in this case it is difficult to stop it
Therefore when these things happen, immediately cover the area of the artery with your hand and keep it there until the bleeding stops, and do not move until the bleeding has ceased.
And keep the olive oil cauteries a low and high flame for a few moments, for a number of times, and blow over them until they are no longer ignited
And take from these a little or a great one according to the place and the size of the break in the artery, over which vein close the bleeding as soon as possible, and cauterize until it is healed and rest that urine
And if the urine is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you have closed the vein, take another cautery and cover it carefully with the previous cauteries that are in the fire, and do not stop until the urine is no longer being expelled
Beware that you do not burn the nerves that are here, and that you come over the patient another illness
And you must know that when the artery is bleeding, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in those ways, especially when the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either by cautery as has been said above, or by extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the limbs are burned and the urine is restricted, or that it be tied with a thread or ligature to make a strong structure, or that it be supported by medicines which have the power to restrict the bleeding; and that it is bound with a powder or constriction bandage
May he who administers the restriction decently of him from food and from stricture of draps or for position of causes that burn and irritate, not comfort but irritate.
If he is unable to do so and the physician is not present or does not have medicine, then he should immediately stop the operation according to what has been said above, and understand that he has reached great distress in that part until the sovereign part of the plague has departed, and on the wound he says it should not be washed; and on the wound he should sprinkle with cold water of great freshness until the wound is healed and closed. And more than that he must cauterize or apply medicine as necessary.</end_of_turn>
From incision and perforation and winds and phlegm and plagues and similar things.</start_of_turn
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases in which cautery is convenient and medicine is comburent, and the occasions and causes of these, and the instruments necessary for them in the forms of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters of the sovereign part of the head to the feet.</start_of_turn
And I will proceed in this chapter in that manner, so that what is desired may be relieved, as far as possible.</start_of_turn
And behold that I have begun this chapter in this way, so that you may learn that in this chapter terror is in the first chapter of cautery.</start_of_turn
And for this reason great caution is necessary, because in the operation which is in this chapter there are many things which, if not evacuated, can cause great harm to the life of the patient, such as the bursting of a vein or perforation of an abscess or opening of an expotamus or evacuation of pus or extraction of a splinter or incision of a stone.</start_of_turn And all these things are accompanied by fear and tremor and in most of them death.</start_of_turn
And I admonish you that you should not be proud of yourselves because of your station, for some great diseases may be caused by your arrogance.</start_of_turn And it is better for you to know that it is your arrogance which will go with your disease and which will bring you death, and that it is better for you to be humble about your disease than to be proud of it, and for the length of your disease and for the fear of the disease which means death.</start_of_turn
And for these things I have said to you, your hope for that sanctuary and your bitter disease are pernicious.</start_of_turn
Therefore do not consent to anything that is proposed to you from which this custom originates; and your caution should be greater than your desire; and do not presume any cause except for that which you know for certain that is useful to you, and to which you can attribute a successful result.</start_of_turn
Use in the treatment of all these diseases the prognosis and indication to which health is converted, for in that is to you the helper in the acquisition of fame and memory, of love and glory.</start_of_turn
Oh, children, God be with you and do not fear to be directed and protected, for he is in your hand.</start_of_turn
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according to the order of the chapters of cautery, from the head to the feet, so that you may be relieved of what you desire and of what you need.</start_of_turn
First Chapter.</start_of_turn
Of the treatment of water which is contained in the head of children.</start_of_turn
Wisdom teaches us that this disease does not often affect children in their infancy, but when the nurse brings the child's head into the sunlight.
And many times the cause of this is hidden which is not known.</start_of_turn
I have not seen this disease except in infancy; and in all those whom I have seen it has been accompanied by death, and for this reason I have left this work undone in these.</start_of_turn
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, the head of which was always so large that it could not rest upon itself because of its greatness, and that the humidity caused by the heat made matters worse until death occurred.</start_of_turn
And this humidity is either added between the cartilage and the bone, or is added outside the bone over the cartilage.</start_of_turn
For when the operation is done when the moisture is between the navel and the bone and the afterbirth is scanty, then you must make a cut in the middle of the foot with a fissure two lines wide, until the moisture runs out. This is the way of performing the spagnum.
And thus if the moisture is more increased and the afterbirth is greater, then two cuts are made according to this manner:
And if the moisture remains on the bone, a sign of its being is that sometimes the head of the bone is opened entirely and the water is squeezed out when you press that with your thumb against the edges and it does not remain on the surface Until three cuts are made in the middle of the foot according to this manner:
And thus extract all the moisture; then strengthen the cuts with strips of cloth and sponges; then pour vinegar over the wound and olive oil until the fifth day, and then remove the ligaments and care for the wound with attempts and ointments, and strengthen the foot equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the limb is comforted and healed
And another method of incision is that you consider the magnitude of the afterbirth and the collection of the water, for sometimes the afterbirth is greater in the occipital region, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore attend to the incision where the afterbirth appears and the replenishment of the water, and do the incision as you are able to do.
And observe that you do not cut the artery, and that the blood flows freely from health and calms the patient for that flow of health with the evacuation of moisture.
End of book/document.
When the ankle or knee swells with boils or abscesses, and it is old, and you do not trust in the care of medicines, then the greatest care is in the incision of those two arteries.
And thus when you wish to make the incision of those, let the patient take some wine to empty his stomach, and press the area around the wound with rough hands so that the arteries appear, and strengthen the foot of the patient with some cloth; and consider where the vein is placed; and the places where some of them are located that are adjacent to the anklebones depressed, so that they do not escape you
And thus speak again about the ligature with attempts, and make incisions of some of the acute parts of the foot at the incision to reach the bone, and be it for the width of the foot.
And if you wish, within the spagnum leave the artery and ligate the others at the ends of the incisions on the parts beneath
And the length of the incision is two fingers adjusted, for when any vein is incised the blood is ejected with a pulsating exit, which leaps from one place to another frequently
More if the ligation does not appear at the incision, then cover that you measure the ankle with the quantity of space of three fingers, and speak again with attempts, and make it enter the bone
And what you get from the blood is the quantity of one cup of wine, and little more or less, according to the quantity that appears from the virtue of the patient and the replenishment of the artery of him
And thus consider the wound, and therefore if anything remains on the bone of any cause of swelling, then the incision must be made so that no abscess arises from the cautery
And strengthen the wound with sponges and silk threads, and care for that which is in healing until it is healed
End of book/document
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples
When in some accidental injuries the ancient or sharp edges of bone become loose from the humors due to agricultural humidity or for any other reason, or are old and extremely painful and resemble those, and it does not comfort them, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or to the cauterization of those same things as we have shown
And the manner of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient raises the parts for which they are in the temples; and understand the visible artery in the temple that is shown to you by the hand, and it is hidden except in a few people due to its intensity of heat.
If it is hidden, the hour of the patient's suffering is strong; and therefore quickly cool the area with an asper or evaporate it with cold water until the swelling subsides. Then take hold of the limb from which this is the shape: And quickly with your thumb grasp the area which facilitates this, until you reach the swelling; then remove it from there and extract it from the surrounding area until you have extracted it from the thumb and uncovered that which is beneath it, from all sides
Moreover, if the artery is narrow, tightly encircle the limb with the nail, and then cut away a part according to the amount by which the limb is elongated and contracted, and do not break the flow of blood, for if it is not cut away it will not cure the bloodletting at all
And quickly evacuate blood from the wound about an inch. Until three.
And if the wound is great, tightly bind that in two places with strong wax or strong strings, and do not leave it exposed until the pus has solidified and the wound has healed
And incise the excess which is between two ligaments; and do this in this hour or another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize that which is cut off until it reaches the bone which is cut off, and stop working in this place and do that work elsewhere.</start_of_turn>
And it is better work if the patient has a fever or is suffering from acute inflammation; for the cutting is of those causes which help the humors to dry out, and therefore it is better in general.</start_of_turn>
And tightly bind the extraction of the arteries that you perceive in the ankle, and keep it covered with fine dust; and also apply either dry healing with dry medicines or wet healing with lotions until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if while you are working another wound should discharge blood from the artery, stop work and restrict that bleeding, or cut off the limb or fill the ankle with something, and hold your hand over it until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn And if none of these things are your concern, the hour suspends the thumb mentioned above until the bleeding has stopped, and immerse the limb in cold water of violent cold until the acute inflammation subsides, and strengthen it as much as you can.</start_of_turn
And what is most curious in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein at this cut, having two stitches, because you have marked the two places with your nails, and having paused for some, not having ignited, until it reaches the bone and cuts the vein in two places, so that it is elongated what is between the limbs, which are not consolidated at all by this cutting.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the cut:</start_of_turn
And the acute of the two nails is equal.</start_of_turn Moreover, if you make two smaller incisions it is better, for if you make two large incisions close to each other you will damage the flesh too quickly.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when there is any thickness, keep the heat of the fire in those places and the flesh is easily detached.</start_of_turn
This work is better in all work and lighter.</start_of_turn
And the space between two nails is the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</start_of_turn

On the care of body ailments caused by the sharp and acidic humors of the bones.
When the humors are acidic, and it is the body of those veins which are above the head of the sufferer, and do not consult in any way concerning the treatment of medicine, and sometimes the face of the patient already swells up and sits in the seat of humility before walking like a procession of ants, and the bones of that limb are stretched, hummed out as if they had been known before, and the nails are scaled by the sharpness of the tears, which were formerly a remedy for these operations, and now they do not know how to treat them with space.</start_of_turn
And you command the patient to raise his feet, and immediately make three incisions equally distant according to the length of the face.</start_of_turn And if the length of the incision is two fingers: let one incision be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the face, and the second according to the length of the tear ducts, and the third from the other side.</start_of_turn
Keep your hands away from the armpits, which are in two lines, and extend your hand from the continuation of both mandibles. If the space of any incision is three fingers wide, adjust it accordingly.</end_of_turn>
And if you have a sponge pad or dry cloth at hand, soak it in the blood and apply it to the area.</end_of_turn
Then between the two sharp extremities insert the instrument of the incision of them: which is from the edge of the temple to the second incision.</end_of_turn> Excise from that area the cord that is between two incisions over the bone, and then make the incision migrate into the second incision.</end_of_turn And then take away this sponge and insert into the first incision another instrument which is called cutellar, hooked at one end and blunt at the other.
Keep the hooks of that hook away from the attached flesh of the cord, and the hooks of the lion towards the bone, and fill up that which reaches the migrating fissure, and close with that all the vessels that descend from the head to the heels.</end_of_turn>
May be continued the incision as far as the cord appears, and then make again in the migrating fissure into the other incision.</end_of_turn
And when the blood has drained out in sufficient quantity, press the areas of the feet of the blood with sponges.</end_of_turn
And then stop in any dry wound from before, and cover those powders with vinegar and oil and vinegar again, and which do not cause pus to form again.</end_of_turn
And on the third day remove the ligament and administer great abundance of lukewarm water or tepid, and take care that there be oil of basilisk and rosemary among the plaguases so that the wounds may heal.</end_of_turn

From the care of the eyebrows down to the heels descend from the parts that extend from the temples.
When at some time catarrh of the humors is acute and persistent, and sometimes the feet of the patient swell, and already their regard concerning them is commendable, and their eyelids ulcerated and their nails pale, and in the front of the head is severe toothache and subsequent vomiting, these things are the result of these accidents that the humors and catarrh do not circulate but by blood vessels coming from the distant parts.</end_of_turn
And the best treatment for these is this: that the patient be commanded to drink plenty of cold water, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, a little for the width (and begin at the incision of the left temporal until the right temporal; and let the incision be from the bone; and extend your hand from the lacerations of the temples which are bitten by the teeth).
Extract all the blood with sponge or dry cloth and then fill the two lips of the incision with old cloth or strips of gauze.</end_of_turn> And take away from them those powders that are among the veins with vinegar and oil so that it does not cause pus to form again.</end_of_turn
When you have drained all that and you see that the swelling is already diminishing, then keep the bones covered until they begin to harden, and take care of that which is the regimen of drying which makes them harden, as if you took from wheat two parts and from barley four parts and mixed them together, or make plaster of them and administer it to these wounds as to newly born flesh.</end_of_turn
End of the treatise.</end_of_turn
Of the care of that which is in the ankles.</end_of_turn>
Every cause which is in the ankles is of four species, either a mineral stone or one which is like a stone, such as iron and gravel, or one of plant origin such as rue or ivy, or one which is fluid such as vinegar and wine and their like.</end_of_turn
Therefore when stone is in the ankle or another cause similar to these does not adjust or grow in the ankle, keep the ankle in the sun, and if sometimes the stone, then extract it with olive oil or vinegar, and give it condiment, and bandage the wound to prevent it from bursting.</end_of_turn And keep away from the circuit of the ankle some pieces of fat or wool, and extend the ankle to the parts above, because the veins which are congested are full of blood from these causes.</end_of_turn
If not, then administer extraction from them with the instrument called gesti epicicarios, which is like this:
If it is thoroughly extracted with the gesti, it is good; otherwise, then administer the extraction of them with every possible gentleness.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, if it is not thoroughly extracted by this, then make a needle of gut and enter the extremity of the needle into the hole of the ankle and close around the needle with wax and olive oil so that nothing is left except the needle itself.</end_of_turn> And thus extract from the belly with great attraction, which troops viewed as similar to those which we have recounted.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if it is not thoroughly extracted in this manner, then take hold of the inflamed or swollen parts with the hand which has been taken, and take hold of the toes with the other hand, and then cover over that area conveniently with a cushion.</end_of_turn And then enter that into the hole of the ankle easily, and then dry the ankle from the moisture.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if it is not thoroughly extracted in all the ways which we have recounted, then you must order that that which deserves to be cut away be cut off either because of a bruise or spasm.</end_of_turn>
And the way to cut that which is that you at first treat the phlegm of the vena saphenous and extract from the root following the manner of the virtue of the herbs, and then make that vanish between your hands and convert the ankle to the parts surrounding it, and make a small cut on the heel of the ankle in order to drain the pus from it.</end_of_turn And if the cut is like the figure of the moon, enter until it reaches the bone, and when the bone is grasped, remove that if you can with appropriate instruments; and cover the cut at that hour with speed, and care that it is healed when it is sound.</end_of_turn
And if the cause of the pain in the ankle is one of the humors which grow and infiltrate, then administer the cure and the extraction of them; even if you do not obey your lord immediately, the doctor will take hold of your hand gently in this manner.</end_of_turn And administer to that the evacuation of that humor which is caused in the ankle.</end_of_turn
And do not be afraid when you think that that has already been moistened by the vapor of the ankle, and keep it in soft masses, and extract from that with nails or with a subtle hand, or by incision as we have said, for the evacuation of it alleviates the extraction.</end_of_turn
But in the water in which the ankle is immersed let the patient use a sternutation at the beginning, and fill the ankle with some old rags, and hold over that ankle the water in which the patient is immersed, and if by that it is thoroughly extracted, it is good; otherwise, the doctor will take hold of your hand gently and will give you orders according to the length of the finger, and he will strike those in the fire a little, and the patient will put one of those into the hole of his ankle and jump over one leg of that part and strike with another leg against the bone which is opposite to the ankle.</end_of_turn Therefore do not stop until all the water is thoroughly extracted.</end_of_turn
Therefore do not stop until all the water is thoroughly extracted.</end_of_turn And when the water is thoroughly extracted like this, take paper or sponge, etc.,</end_of_turn put one extremity into the ankle and extend the other extremity over the fire until the moisture of it is consumed.</end_of_turn
And put the other sponge and make water so many times until all the water is thoroughly extracted, and then remove that with a needle as is said of the extracting bone.</end_of_turn
But in the extraction of the beast which enters into that ankle, if it is small, leave it in and hold it still, care for it as we have said in the division; however, if it is of great size which causes appearance at the same time, then administer the extraction of it with nails and fingers, and the cause of it is less burdensome than all the other causes which cause pain in the ankle.</end_of_turn
But in the extraction of the worm engendered in the ankle, when you have cared for that which we have said in the division and in the treatise of distillations and do not neglect your cure, then the doctor covers that the ankle is exposed to the sun.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if any cause of the worms appears, then extract that with nails or subtle fingers, even if no other cause appears, then take a needle from behind and grasp it widely of which this is the form: The patient's limb is plunged into the heel according to the quantity that he suffers; and immediately succeed in that by applying pressure, making the veins visible, until all the worms are forced out.
Even if I do not obey your order, know that I have closed the circuit of the cannula as we have said; now administer the distillations which have already been prepared in the treatment of the worms, and you will find them in the treatise of distillations.</end_of_turn>
And concerning the effusions which occur with the application of medicines in the heel by means of this instrument, this is their form.</end_of_turn> And if it is silver or gold, leave it straight, in which there is a small hole, and apply pressure downwards.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you want to make an incision in the concavity of the heel of the continent here is where it is necessary.</end_of_turn And if you wish, take the ray and wrap it around the foot downward correctly, and pour oil into the cavity of the heel, or juice of any herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines in the cannula – which is in the heel – and then insert the ray into the foot downward and press with your hand what is above until the oil is expelled from the cavity of the heel and the patient sits the oil behind.
And whatever is infiltrated in the heel is already scorched with fire a little.</end_of_turn> And keep in mind that the cause for which you distill in the heel should not be too strong, because the heel medicines do not suffer from that.</end_of_turn>
Chapter VII.</end_of_turn>
Of the treatment of the blistering of the heel.</end_of_turn>
Some veins of young children and even adults do not perforate, and when this happens in adults, blistering of the heel occurs by pressure or by a wound in that area; and this blistering is sometimes useful in the preparation of the wound of the heel which does not always happen, and sometimes in the parts outside.</end_of_turn
And that which happens in the preparation of the wound, which does not always happen, is in the greatest degree of difficult healing.</end_of_turn
And in that in which you are successful, keep the heel of the patient to the sun and rest in that.</end_of_turn Therefore, if sometimes the apparent blistering occurs, open that with a pointed cautery of the kind which has just been mentioned.</end_of_turn
If the limb is small in the part where it is, of which one part is acute and the other is not; and the wound is of two lion’s heads so that it does not make a wound in the heel.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the blistering is for a wound that has arisen in the heel or in the meat of the foot, know that you must make incisions with fine needles and cut that with great ease until all the flesh is removed.</end_of_turn
And if the blistering is in the preparation of the heel, then take a ray of lion’s head and burn that a little, and then put that on the meat of the heel.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if you smell blistering with that which the patient finds with ease, for the weight of the limb, strengthen the pressure of the limb with ease; and keep in mind that you do not damage the nerves of the heel.</end_of_turn
And thus keep the heel wrapped around with linen as much as the breadth of the wound allows; and do this until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or that you take something and put it in vinegar and powder over it and rub it in, and use it; and if sometimes the heel has already hardened, then know that you must remove the something which you have wrapped around it and replace it with another which you have wrapped in grease so that it is useful with olive oil, until the abscess is discharged; and take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if there is a flow of pus, know that you must immerse sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the heel, and use another remedy which restricts the flow of pus, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillations.</end_of_turn

Of the care of the swelling which they owe to the eyelids.</end_of_turn
The swelling which they owe to the eyelids of the heels is some veins which are moist, while some veins are dry.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover those with tenacles or nails and remove those with splints from the root of their hair, and then pause over the area that is affected.
Maybe if pain comes from the flux of blood, then you cauterize those with lancets at the root of the hair
And the best cautery is to make incisions and lead away the unsightly veins that return when the cause of these hair is removed; and when they are cauterized with fire, those hairs are burned up and do not return

Great pain that comes to the eyelashes of the eyes
The veins become swollen under the eyelashes of the eyes due to any cause that makes them similar to great swelling in their strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called great swelling.
And it is an accumulation of large moisture in the eyelid outwards and downwards.
Therefore the operation for them is to consider if the swelling comes from outside the eyelid and is widespread; and the cause is light
Therefore take an incision along the width, and then drain all the excess outwards as easily as possible, and then suspend the nails and cut away that.
And if the figure is great, then adjust it with stitches; and care for that until it is healed
And if it is little, do not worry too much about that because the edge of the wound will restore itself and heal.
And if the swelling is receding from the edges of the eyelid, you must stretch the surface outwards, for even if you remove the nail, if the eyelid is stretched by the incision, the pain will not be relieved
And finally, after the incision, wash the area with salt water; and care for the area until it is healed.
End of document
About the care of the eye from outside the eye.
The grey that is generated in the tunics of the eyelid outwards, especially in children, aggravates the eyes of those who suffer from it because it makes them cloudy and prevents the sun from penetrating them
And so sometimes those who are nearsighted look at their face all the time, and over their face while they sleep; and over the eyelashes of their eyes they have wet eyebrows, which have already covered the swelling, and the imminent appearance of wrinkles is in the eye; and when you press on the area around the eyes, the wrinkles disappear within them
And any way of operating is in that in which the patient lies down on his belly, and you put your hand over his head and chin, and make a circle according to the amount that contains all the matter of the entire eye; and press that over that and press on the area around the eyes so that it becomes gathered in the middle of the circle, and finally make an incision along the width, and the incision should not be greater than the incision that is made in a flabby eye
However in the process cover that the entire coat of the eye must be covered until you reach the humors, because in the meantime there is a process of humoral diuresis through the incision according to the shape of the white of the eye.
Therefore extract that which you have wrapped around which you have covered between the eyelids of the parts in front and back, and rotate between the hand of the right and left until it is dispersed
And take care that you do not touch in the incision so that the humors do not reach the eye and remove that.
However if it does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, then adjust in the incision a little to facilitate the process of humoral diuresis; and then extract that which we have said; and then wash away the drapes with vinegar and water and put over the area and dry those which are like dust
And so when they have bled salt and stopped that in the concavity of the incision so that that which remains of that humidity.
And care for that until it is healed
However if an accident happens in the place after the cautery, then care for that with adhesive plasters until it is healed
Capitol xi.
The eleventh chapter
When humors are thickened by cold and cause the natural discharge to become thick, it is known as a discharge of humors which causes tears and soft discharge of the eyelids and membrane of the eyelids, which is the cause of destruction of the humors, which is called taktinir of the humors. And there are four methods for treating this: by cautery; or by acute medicine as it is said in the chapter of cautery; or by incision and suture; or by cautery.
Therefore, place the head of the patient in the gut; convert the lower eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is converted, it is well done; otherwise, insert the needle into the part where there is greater thickness below the margin of the eyelid, and penetrate the tissue with the needle, and when you have pierced it, withdraw the needle from the margin of the eyelid towards the pupil, and convert that part to the pupil
And now make an incision in the lower part of the eyelid along the margin of the greater lacrimal canal towards the lesser lacrimal canal; then withdraw the needle and place fine powder of lead or white lead on the eyelid; and put your hand over the eyelid like the figure of a leaf of myrtle.
However, you must take into consideration the degree of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies among men; for some require a great incision of the large eyelid according to the degree of swelling.
And make an incision along the two lines you have marked, starting from the greater lacrimal canal towards the lesser lacrimal canal And if you make the incision through the natural orifices like the greatness of a king.
And put on the sponge in one of the two angles of the wound, and then scrape away all that is around it; and tighten up the two lips with sutures of silk or fine thread, and remove the intestines, and stick together whatever excess of thread remains on two eyebrows with some other means, if you wish to do so, or leave it alone
And finally, remove the sutures from the eyes in three or four days, and take care of them.
Or if you wish, leave the dressing on the sutures, and take care of the pain that is caused by the swelling and tension of the eyelid, because the swelling is relieved by the seal of the dressing and the adhesion of the parts; indeed, it is better to leave it like that than to suture.
However, do not be afraid of the patient, for this is a good operation, and do not be afraid of him.
And another method for treating this is to mark a figure on the eyelid like the figure of a leaf of myrtle, and to lift the eyelid with three nails secured together in this way:
If this is not possible, have nails of equal size, and when the nails are not equal in size, take a needle which has a loop at one end and put that into the middle of the figure, and insert the other needle through the greater lacrimal canal, and the needle according to the lesser lacrimal canal, and tighten between the nails mentioned above with equal measure, and then put your hand over the area mentioned above with elevation equal to the elevation of the eye.
And tighten up the two lips of the dressing with sutures, and take care of that which is inside when it is healed
If there is bleeding from the incision or the wound, put a compress over it and keep it still, and do not move it.
Many herbs must be applied to the eye that causes the swelling to disappear as they are converted; therefore, in this case you must use what we have said about incision; indeed, suture in whatever way is more artificial
Taxing by cautery is like this: And you convert the eyelid and split the figure that is inside as I have said; and with two needles or two fine lancets of which the length is according to the length of the eyelid and the width is less than the width of the sponge. And you have already opened at the extremities of each part where you have the thread.
Therefore, add some little bit of substance over the excess of humors which comes out of the eye, and tighten the needles of each part with strong tension, and leave that for a few days, for the swelling will disappear by itself when the tension is removed and will not come back again.
May it be timely, for the hour breaks the flame of torpor, and quickly heals the plague before it becomes healthy.
Therefore when the patient is quiet, the pupil is dilated and the pulse is weak.</end_of_turn>
This is the way to do two needles according to this method: ...and the amount of length and width should be neither too much nor too little.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XII.</end_of_turn>
About the elevation of the pulse when the limb is stiff.</end_of_turn
When the pulse is unnatural, hard and rough, and the limb is swollen, the doctor should take a fine needle and pass it through the sensitive area of the heel and the groin, and then adjust the extremities so that they are neither too tight nor too loose.</end_of_turn And the length of the needle should be equal to the amount of a palm.</end_of_turn
And quickly take another fine needle and leave it in for a short time, and then withdraw the extremities of that limb if you wish.</end_of_turn
Then place the patient's hand on the belly and keep it close to the sun so that your work is declared, for this is a subtle and small operation.</end_of_turn>
Then insert the needle into the base of the limb, adjusting the area that requires support, and make that penetrate into the pupil rapidly until you remove the excessive swelling of the limb.</end_of_turn
Then draw out the limb from under and insert it into the alixate, and let the pulse rest for one or two or three and no more.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw your hand from that limb until the limb is naturally outside the alixate in the pupil.</end_of_turn
If the limb is not naturally expelled by the alixate and is still swollen, remove the alixate from the parts beyond the needle which you have passed through in that place, until the limb is naturally expelled from the wound.</end_of_turn
And in this way with the vision of the limb, because the doctor has grasped the alixate and the needle, and groaned somewhat and closed the pupil, and left them closed for two or three days, until the limb adheres to the belly and appears over that good limb.</end_of_turn
And if the limb is somewhat short, the doctor should adjust a long limb of the natural kind, and elevate it to that height, or that he should lower it until it is equal to some space, and when it is equal he should elevate it.</end_of_turn
Chapter XIII.</end_of_turn
About the care of the swelling that appears in the pupil under the needle.</end>
When there is swelling in the pupil, and the pupil is contracted when it is contracted in its entirety, or to the right or left side, due to poor consolidation of the plague or cutting or cautery, and there is leporine ointment, and this swelling is either natural or accidental, and is useful for the consolidation of the plague or cuts or cautery, or for keeping them from becoming worse.</end_of_turn
The way of performing this operation is that you make that consolidation and separate the layers of the limb, and place in it an amount of lard equal to two fingers, and bind them until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And do not neglect to use an emollient to soften the causes of the swelling, constriction; for if you do not do this, it will be worse at any time than before.</end_of_turn
Use in these cases that soften it as much as possible, such as fennel, and soak it in the water in which they are cooked with salt and seed of licorice, or in vinegar, which is liquefied with some oil, and immerse the wound in it, and care for it.</end_of_turn
And the treasure of your care is that you puncture with all your skill so that it is not consolidated according to the way we began.</end_of_turn
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing but the rectification of swelling that does not restore the shape of the limb as it was before.</end_of_turn
Chapter XIV.</end_of_turn
About the care of swelling that is useful in the pupil beyond.</end_of_turn
The swelling that is useful in the pupil beyond is truly called true swelling; and it is either natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
The cause of the accidental wound is either from a wound or a burn or from cautery or from something similar.
The way to perform the operation is that you take a needle and make a double fold in it, and keep that in the flesh, and pass the thread from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
And then extend the flesh to the parts around the needle and hold that with the needle, and make an incision at a wide space.</start_of_turn> And thus if you return the figure of the eyelid according to the cover, it is not good; and if not, take hold of the edge and stop that in the fissured figure, and on that convert the eyelid, and close the two incisions on the side of the eyelid leaving.</start_of_turn
And the extremities of the two incisions are at two angles of the incision, which you have made until they converge, and when they converge make a wound at their convergence.</start_of_turn
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.</start_of_turn
And then hold the flesh that is left of the amount of the edge of the eye that is left out of it, so that the eyelid is closed.</start_of_turn
And then adjust the separated parts and sew those with the thread of silk; and then care for those as we have said of the soothing medicines and the bandages that must be used so that it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the wound should happen by fracture or suture or cautery, the hour covers that you make an incision on the edge of the eyelid according to what is preceded.</start_of_turn And then separate the hair between two lips as we have said.</start_of_turn
In the sum of the speech of the care of the patient when he is diseased or left, that runs in his operation, according as it is prepared in the form of alxacrati, and that is in the form of diverse spots.</start_of_turn
And the skilled surgeons always prepare something in some way that makes it possible for him to return the figure to its natural shape, or rather in that way, and that bad disease according as it may be convenient for the operation and the instruments in the greatest convenience.</start_of_turn
End of treatise.</start_of_turn
Adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.</start_of_turn
When this adhesion occurs with several people in the neighborhood, it must be solidified by separating the eyelid from the edge of the orbit, and be prohibited from the facility of movement and of its natural works, therefore you must remove the limb beyond the edge of the eyelid, and elevate it above, or extend it with the nail.</start_of_turn
And then you make an incision for the adhesion with a blunt instrument, which is not at the acute of the incisions, having made obtuse a little so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and remain that the tissue is not stripped of its sensitivity.</start_of_turn
And the incision should be such as to excise that adhesion with facility until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and that the adhesion is healed whole.</start_of_turn
And then put on the eye a saline solution in which you wash; or distill in it the powdered sulfur dissolved in water.</start_of_turn
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a strip of gauze, and put over the eye a bandage of soaked linen, and use three times a day adhesive substances until it is healed.</start_of_turn
End of treatise.</start_of_turn
Of incision of the nail and elevation of the flesh of the lacrimals.</start_of_turn
The wisdom says that the nail is according to two manners, that is either nervous or similar to a hard soft sponge; or non-nervous, similar to white humidity that is solidified, which when you touch it, or force it to take hold with the nail, is separated and the nail is not held in it.</start_of_turn
And both of these species do not begin until after the greater lacrimal has gone little by little that covers the sight and hinders the light and the movement of the eye.</start_of_turn
The manner of working in the incision of these is that the patient should keep his head bowed over his belly, and that you touch his eyes with your hand, and elevate the eyelid with your hand, and collect the nail with the nail of little duplication and extend it to the surrounding parts.</start_of_turn E aprop pren una agula e entromet en aquela un pel de cavalh o de buou o de vaqua, o de semblantz, o de fiel fort, o duplica la extremitat de la agulha petit a petit e fica aquela en le mieg de la ungla, e penetra aquela am la agulha, e lia am fiel la ungla; e exten aquela a las partidas desus, e excorja am le pel le latz de la ungla lo qual siec la pupilla. And thus you will keep that which is within the nail outwards.
And then you will leave the incision in the root of the lacrimal gland at the edge of the tear duct, with small forceps or with fine scissors, and remove the natural plug of the lacrimal gland so that, by incision, no drops of tears continue to flow
And if some veins the nail with the thread on which it is wound, as we have said, and then stretch it out with the lion's tail of which this is the form:
Take care that in the tail does not touch the corneal tunic and that you avoid breaking it, and that the pupil is perforated.</start_of_turn>
Then take the incision and sprinkle a little coarse salt or do with vinegar to make it bleed, and leave that in for a while; and then care for that which is inside so that it becomes healthy again.
And if the nail is not nerve-sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor keep it in that place, when these nails of this kind are cured they are cured with medicines, and are healed in this way as well as recommended in the division.</start_of_turn>
And if you want to make an incision, then you open the patient's mouth and take a piece of gauze of suitable breadth following this manner: with smoothness.</start_of_turn> And if sometimes that is rare and is confined and enters into that place, then distill from your time at the mouth of the patient by making vinegar or salt or coarse salt, and pour the vinegar into the wound the next day.</start_of_turn
And then repeat the operation until everything that is of it is removed, except that the after-burn remains in the mouth, for you must read that, and care for the after-burn from the beginning until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And repeat your operation on that for a reason until it is healed.</start_of_turn
The swelling of the lacrimal gland, if you notice it in the mouth for a great time, suspend it with the nail; and make the incision in that area, and do not finish the incision so that no tears flow from it.</start_of_turn
And then distill vinegar in the lacrimal gland and make vinegar or salt until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Of the incision of the joints and of what is born from an adjusted limb in the mouth.</start_of_turn
Some veins in the heel of the limb are born from a rough cartilage, and are over-extended until they cover the pupil, or approach or expand over the eyelashes and strongly press the eyelashes against the margins and are gathered like a bundle of straw.</start_of_turn
More than all the patient should keep his head still in the belly if he wants to live; and then grasp the limb of that and collect all that cartilage with nails convenient to that, and with a forceps or a basket; and make the incision of the cartilage at the beginning until everything is finished with the needle, and take care that you do not break that which you must leave.</start_of_turn
And the incision should be made as we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with fine scissors as this will be the form of it in this chapter.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the incision is completed and all that cartilage is removed, then fill the mouth with coarse salt, or distill into powder the rough and similar to the corrosive medicines, and leave it over the wound with an albumin bandage until it is certain that the after-burn is gone.</start_of_turn
And if there remains any cause of stiffness and it is necessary to make an after-burn, and you fear after-burn, then read the mouth and care for that after-burn with liquids that will cause that after-burn to cease, and repeat the operation on that until it is healed, and in the cartilage which is affected in this kind of case.</start_of_turn
May you take heed that you should refrain from all care of the foul humor both naturally and accidentally, or by any other means, and do not place your hand upon any of these operations until you have observed that the member is suffering from that operation.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The foul humor is collected from the bowels.
The veins of the bowels are swollen, which are tested by pressing upon the belly and must be forbidden from any action, and must be given rest for a long time
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the foul humor in which the belly is affected is strong or not, and that no other disease is associated with the foul humor, for in such a case you collect that foul humor.
And you command the patient to lie down on the belly if he is able, and suspend those veins with an ounce or two according to your prudence; and let that ounce be doubled in this way:
or so two ounces gradually in a body according to this manner
And then gradually collect those veins with subtle forceps, with skill, and remove the feces an hour at a time until all those veins are relaxed from the belly and have returned to their normal position
Beware that you do not lead the belly too much towards the extremities of the buttock; and if your operation is in the morning at sunrise, and if you are firm in your operation that you do not insert anything except those veins.
And when you have completed, then you distil in the belly cold vinegar or vinegar for that it may remove what is remaining from the belly.
May you if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, and when you have plastered all that remains with that which will leave the pain, leave it for a while until the pain has subsided and the swelling has disappeared.
And repeat over it as much as the maid can manage until it is healed.
And this is the manner of the forceps:
The text continues with instructions on the specific technique for using the forceps to collect the foul humor from the patient's belly.
From the reduction of the hernia to the nose.
When you cure hernias with cautery or acute medicine, if it does not succeed as the narration has been told, do not be ashamed of making an incision in the belly to open the abscess; and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is discovered
And when the bone is discovered and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, then you will grasp it with a clamp of this kind:
And it is called a coarse cap, and make it firm without delay, and the head round again as before (as it is done in this form).
And place it over the rotten part of the bone, and gradually rotate that between the thighs, and press your small hand little by little until you know that that corruption is gone
And if there is any remaining blood, and when you have restored the limb with drying and astringent things
So if the limb is consolidated and is newly born good flesh and the wound is closed and the body of the patient is rested for forty days, and it is not renewed and not apostematized and no accident occurs in it, then you will know that it is healed
And if not, then you must repeat the incision to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: if you discover the bone with iron or acute medicine, and when you have discovered the bone, then you take away three layers in this manner:
The edge of the iron is triangular, and the body of the iron is thrust forward into the limb as many times as necessary
And place it over the bone, and that of the lacrimal; and move your hand a little from the belly, and gradually rotate your hand over the wound until you have pierced all the bone, and that you feel the patient groan that he feels the pain as if he were being struck by a blow.
And so restore the limb with astringent and drying medicines just as you would with an abscess.
Therefore when the flesh and bone are tough, the matter which flows out to the parts returns to its place, thus increasing the suspicion of the illness.
When the joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn
When the intestine or hernia has been extruded completely and does not spontaneously return to its place, then it is necessary to grasp the illness, and immediately provide support, and prevent further violent movements in the chest; and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out again.
The way to handle the powders is that you take lion's mane cloth four times, and put every four together like that; and use those four together.</start_of_turn
And place those over each other according to the quantity of the intestine or hernia that is necessary.</start_of_turn And hold firmly over those with strong grip and stricture; and repeat the movements with the hands while pressing down; and prevent the movements and let the intestine rest straight day and night.</start_of_turn
Even if the ligament is softened, it must still be kept straight.</start_of_turn
And prevent the ligament from coming loose both day and night as we have said.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes the intestine or hernia has already returned, good; but if not, then repeat the packing with the powders and the grip and the movements until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the incision of the swelling of the outer covering.</start_of_turn
When there is a disruption in the outer covering of the tunica, and it is imminent and the eyelashes are forced out like a barley grain, and the shape of a man is formed by that, and it is desired to make an incision, then the operation in this case is as follows: enter the needle at the root of the eyelash that is to the side in the direction of the eyebrow; and then insert the needle where the double fold is located, and make that penetrate and withdraw the first needle according to its position; and then make an incision in the middle of the double fold and carry the part of the eyebrow with the needle in the circle of the needle, and hold that firmly.</start_of_turn
And then withdraw the needle and place over the swollen area infused with egg white in an albumin of blood and withdraw until the thread comes out at the root of the hair.</start_of_turn
And take care of the swollen area so that it is comfortable once the wound is healed.</start_of_turn
And many veins gather from all around the area in a circle around the swollen part, and when the sharp object is pierced with the thumb of the preceptor which comes from the circumference of the swelling, the humoral moisture runs out, and the swelling goes down immediately.</start_of_turn
And hold until it is healed.</start_of_turn

On the care of alconates.</start_of_turn
This ailment which is called alconates is nothing other than a bruise which is caused by the accumulation of blood in the flesh resembling stagnant water and not that which is customary.</start_of_turn
The way to handle this ailment is to make the swelling subside over the swelling that appears, and to hold the head firmly with two hands over the two parts and to see if the bruise disappears from the parts that are left; and if you see that the bruise has disappeared in the parts that were left, then it is considered healed.</start_of_turn
If it does not descend further, it is considered water.</start_of_turn
If the bruise is not prepared to descend with water as we have said, then make the patient sit up and apply a sponge soaked in oil over the area around the pupil where the conjunctiva meets the cornea in the periphery (at the root of the pupil), until the bruise is expelled.</start_of_turn
Once it has been expelled, then you should distill in the swollen area lukewarm water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey.</start_of_turn
And take care of the other causes until it is healed.</start_of_turn

From the care of the water descends the smell.
We have already spoken of the qualities of water in the division, and what is to be performed by word has been declared; now, according to the statute.
Therefore you must make the patient cough between the attacks and make him inhale deeply, so that you can smell the illness from him.
And then put your left hand over the patient's left eye, if the water is in the left; or your right hand, if the water is in the right.
And then take the thumb of your right hand, if the water is on the left; or the thumb of your left hand, if the water is on the right.
And then bring the thumb down to the edge of the eye socket for the thickness of the iris in the white of the eye, and touch the thumb with your hand in that place
And then penetrate the eye and sit down so that the thumb has already reached its limit because of the wound.
Therefore measure the length of the thumb from the nail to the pupil, which is the black part of the eye; that is the cornea. And that you may see the pupil clearly through the cornea.
And then withdraw the thumb from the eye and place your hand over it again. And thus if the water descends too much, the pain that was over the eye will decrease, and the water will reach the pupil again
And then rest a little while; so that if the water has descended, stop that other hand from moving until the thumb is dry again.
And thus when it is dry and does not descend, take out the thumb easily, and move your hand slowly; and dissolve in the water a little of clear salt of gem, and wash the eye with that; and then remove the eye patch or bandage or soaked gauze from the eye with olive oil and vinegar, and put some water on the eye.
But these are things of our time and do not concern us now.
And if you do not obey your thumb within the eye due to its hardness — for some men whose eyes are hard as nails — then it is necessary to take the sponge which is named alberid in this way:
And then puncture that conjunctiva, and do not touch your hand in the process, and do not do anything else until the thumb comes out naturally.
And then extract the thumb as we have said.
And you must praise me for the work, since I am prepared to do the patient a service by descending the cold humor that causes pain when it rests on the two soles in a dark room, and I am prohibited from all movement.
And remain in the nature of the water so that its nature is calmed, and do not move the feet either to the right or to the left at all
And do the same according to its custom within the third day.
And then remove that from that dark chamber and restore the sight, and do some things for it, and return the sponge within seven days.
Do not put water in the hour of the cures or at any other time. There is no need to keep the water there for a long time, for the water will grow thirsty and become aggressive and harmful to the eye
But if this should happen after the cautery, then it is necessary to remove the eye immediately on the seventh day, and repair that which was lost in the water
You have restored the sight of the eye and remain over the patient's face for the purpose of regulating their food for a few days, as they exist in the dark chamber.
And thus gradually remove them from that chamber and speak to them about their causes
Remember that in the art of vision there are no excuses for the pupil to rest for some days, and that you must diligently supervise the operation until the end.
And so we have reached some of those things that are found in the Artach, and some say that it is necessary to perform surgery on the eye which is penetrated by the water.
But indeed we have not seen in our land anything like this water, nor have we learned of anything like it among the free men of the ancient times; and it is possible that this is new.
These are the forms of the species of magicians who are about those whom they do not recognize.
Whether they are fat or lean, or of their own kind, and whether their limbs are like this or that, the limb is like that which is triangular in shape.</end_of_turn>

Of the care of animals there is nothing new under the sun.</end_of_turn
When there are various animals born in the nose, some of which are the cause of this, such as scorpions of hair or polypody of the foot; and this disease is called polypody, which is like that foot.</end_of_turn And of these there is a cancerous cancer, lapping, of saffron color; and of these is the lion not of saffron color.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in those lions which are not fraudulent or cancerous, cover that if any disease should arise between your thighs, place it in the sun, and open the veins of them, and prick their belly once in those lions.</end_of_turn And immediately extract that from the parts below, and immediately cut off what you have understood from those parts until you believe that all the animal is consumed; for if there remains any cause of the abscess, then indeed your rat comes with one of the subtle instruments with which it is facilitated that there should be no cause left.</end_of_turn More often than not, if the sovereign lord is present or has been notified postprandial, then indeed you pause it until he covers; or if it is of malignant apostemas, then you cover it and cauterize that until it is dissected and all the cavities are evacuated.</end_of_turn
And immediately apply to the nose again the caustic vinegar or vinegar or wine.</end_of_turn More often than not, when the nose is opened and humidity proceeds to the palate, you know that it is already healed.</end_of_turn>
More often than not, if the humidity does not penetrate as much as to cover, you know that indeed there is no animal in the pores of the veins of the limbs to which it has not penetrated.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover that you enter faithfully to him to whom any greatness belongs, and smell in his hair, and pause between each use the quantity of the thumb or less, and take away the pain and put a limb of the faithful into the veins at the root or for another cause for which it is possible.</end_of_turn
And when that is done, that you take away the scent until it has reached the channels of the veins, and that you wipe it off the greasy surface, for troops guided by such an action make the girls laugh like children in school, and it is a light cause of that which you wish to do.</end_of_turn
And immediately pause the two limbs of the faithful, one that goes out on the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and immediately administer warm blood to the nails that are in the faithful, and do that until you know that the blood is already in the nails of the faithful.</end_of_turn
And immediately extract the faithful, and pause in the nose immediately after the application of the sovereign a soft cushion, and do that for three days or more until the ulcer is completely consumed of all that remains of the animal.</end_of_turn
And at the end of the case, pause in the nose for a plum cannula for a few days until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
More often than not, if you take care of the cure, use this.</end_of_turn
This is the form of the instrument to capture the perfumed one that makes in the veins the distillate of oils and medicines.</end_of_turn
It is made of silver or lead, which is similar to a little lamp with a hole, like a pot with a handle, and the meat is similar.</end_of_turn
Or make a closed cannula like a tube, and put the cannula of the capturing instrument inside and uncover it; to which you will attach that which you will grasp in the olive oil or whatever you want from the juices and substances.</end_of_turn
Capitol XXV.
The disease originates in the extremities of the nose.
Black bile is a natural disease that originates in the extremities of the nose, and is manifested and recognized within a few days, until it is no longer visible to the eye
And in order that you may cover that which has already appeared of it, and eradicate all of it from the very beginning And put your hand over the area or cautery or medicine that is in the place of it.
Maybe if it is delayed its manifestation will be more intense, however, if it is late consider whether it is watery, dark, of a muddy color and without sensation, for in this case do not touch that which is above the cranium; for black bile proceeding from this apostema proceeds with great malice towards that which has been the cause of it
If the apostema is of a tawny color and not dark, and sometimes when its manifestation is possible in all of them, then evacuate the disease and apply that remedy which you consider most appropriate until it is healed.
Capitol XXVI.
Of the suture of the nose and the lips and the ear when the continuity is dissolved by plague or by an ulcer.
The doctors say that when the continuity is dissolved in one of these cartilages, little confidence is found in that operation except in the case of a madman.
Therefore, when you must perform an operation for any cause of these, consider whether it is fresh plague or old ulcers, and adjust the stitches of the plague to the suture, and apply that which will make it healthy again
If the continuity of the suture has already been separated, and there is some healthy part, then cover that part of the cord which appears to you until it is healed And adjust the stitches to the suture and strengthen them, and over them sprinkle holy oil and sprinkle salt, and place over the salt a piece of fine plaster, or another of the solidifying plasters, and leave it in place for two days or three, and then remove that which has been bound and change it, and leave it in place until the wounds are completely healed.
The manner of the suture is that you add the continuity of the suture or with needles just as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the continuity of the suture with thread just as you please and make known
Capitol XXVII
Of the extraction of that which causes swelling in the lips in the parts of the tongue
Black bile must proceed from a madman in the parts of the tongue of their lips to these same apostemas which resemble grass seeds, and some of them are smaller and some are larger
Therefore you must convert the lips and the wounds of any of those hard substances throughout, and apply the extraction of the abscess filled with holy oil until the wound is closed, and wash it with vinegar and cure the wound with an astringent until it is healed
Capitol XXVIII
Of the insertion of the horn adjusted in the gums
Great pain is not said concerning the horn of the carnas adjusted which they formerly called albulus, where we must suspend that with one hand or hold that with the forceps and insert that must be its cause, and leave the blood run or stop the bleeding.
And put over the wound holy oil or another powder astringent or excidant
And if the horn returns, then immediately insert that again, and burn that, for if you burn that again it will not return
Capitol XXIX
Concerning the reason of teeth with iron
When in the surface of the teeth of the parts of the tongue and of the ditch and between the gums there are adjusted hard scales, legs, and some of them are black and are hurtful citrine or vinegar to the gums, because the gum is corrupted by that.
Therefore cover that which is between your teeth and put the head of the bandage in the belly, and scrape the teeth in which those scales appear until no trace of them remains, and that which is of the blackness and the citrine and the others until they are softened.
Therefore, if this is the last time that this has occurred at the beginning of the illness, it is not so; otherwise, repeat the treatment over those very days until it comes to an end.
And know that the teeth have sometimes needed to be moved by various methods and diverse figures, as it is prepared for your operation.</end_of_turn> And so that the razor with which the tooth is shaved is different from the razor with which the teeth are shaved according to other forms, and these various forms of shaving must be prepared by you:

Extraction of teeth.
That when you have cured the tooth of its pain in every way, and you have completed the extraction of it, there is no cause for fear that there will be any remaining sensation of its absence, because it is a sublimed substance that is released during the extraction of it.</end_of_turn
If the illness forces us to extract that tooth, you must firmly declare that it is the painful tooth, because many veined sensations of pain deceive the patient and heal them in a sound tooth, and you should refute that and declare that the pain does not cease until the painful and diseased tooth is extracted, because we have seen this in the operation of children.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you must declare that the painful tooth is that one, and you know well, you must mark the area surrounding the tooth with a sponge that can absorb any moisture, until the tooth is completely removed from its socket, and you should do this either with your hands or with fine forceps from the beginning gradually until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And immediately hold large forces that can hold the tongue firmly for good speaking or great stupor, and stop the patient's head between the painful teeth that you must hold so that it does not move, and gently extract the tooth in the manner that does not cause further pain to the patient.</end_of_turn
And so, if it is not forgotten, take one of those instruments and put it aside in every part with ease and facilitate the extraction of it as it is done from the beginning.</end_of_turn>
If the tooth is fractured or cracked, you must support that fracture and strengthen that with the tip of the knife at the edge so that it is not fractured during the process of your constriction on that area.</end_of_turn
And be careful to work cautiously with sacrifice in the area of the entire gum, and keep your strength that you do not break that one and leave it fractured, and return to the patient after you have made the greatest malice of the first pain of it.</end_of_turn
Remember that the ignorant barbers make great blunders in their eagerness to eradicate teeth, since they do not administer what we have recommended; for many veined sensations cause great suffering to patients that are more difficult to extract than those that remain. Therefore, some of these or all of these, or that you extract that tooth along with some of the bone of the mandible as we have often seen in the case of these veined sensations.</end_of_turn
And finally, after the extraction, rinse the mouth with wine vinegar or wine with salt.</end_of_turn>
And if blood flows from the wound to help, as is often the case, then remove any amount of blood and sprinkle it over the wound, and if you do not confirm that blood, cauterize.</end_of_turn
The shape of the forceps and fine pliers with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning is long handle, short handle and wide, so that they do not bend when you are working.</end_of_turn
And so, sometimes with a wide handle and sometimes with a short handle, when you first begin with these, do not bend, but are short-handled.</end_of_turn
And they are made of Indian iron descending, and are made of bristles descending, and in the bristles of these there are teeth that are introduced one into the other and emerge by strong constriction, and some of these bristles have the shape of a heron's beak, which is so wide, and are of strong constriction.</end>

Extraction of teeth and extraction of the fractured bones of the mandibles.</end_of_turn>
When you must extract a tooth that is fractured, there remains some cause, then you must pause on the area around the joint for a day or two until the pain is softened; and immediately apply algesics or hold the pliers with which they are composed in the shape of a heron's beak called ciconia or guanta, which is so wide.</end_of_turn
The extremities of them are affected by pain as if by lime or porridge.
If you do not obey my advice in this matter, with these forceps or pincers, cover your hand over the reason and scratch all the flesh and enter the instrument that has no name, for it is a slight lever of this kind:
And do it briefly at the large extremity, and do not be afraid so that it is not broken
Therefore, if for this the reason is split, it is not good; and if not, help me with other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is that of a triangular extremity in which there is any thickness
The form of the second instrument is that of a triangle and of more subtle extremity
And already with this instrument you have had two slopes of which this is the form nearby: And with other instruments which I will enumerate in order of teeth; for in this way it is useful for this instrument which is composed like an onion, and this is the form:
Of the triangular extremity, round or short, which is any thickness, and do not be afraid so that it is not broken.
And so remain the other instruments of the teeth like the others.
May the skillful artists know and be skilled in the art, so that they find for themselves the means according to what it signifies to them, for the operation and the various diseases; for these are the diseases for which the ancients did not say or even name their proper instruments, for the forms of various species.
May the jawbone or other bones of the mouth be fractured or loosened if necessary, for in that case be the weight supported over that which is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help me with that which is the form:
And be of every great or small size, be it tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or escape until the bone is completely fractured; and then restore the area with convenient medicines at your disposal.</start_of_turn>
May the small bone be slightly ground down if necessary, and grind away its blackness, and take care of that until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXXII.</start_of_turn>
On the care of the teeth especially concerning the others.</start_of_turn
When the teeth are prominent beyond their natural course for those of the form of a claw, and especially when it comes to women, and especially to the venerable toes; therefore you must consider: if the tooth is nothing like another tooth, and it is not possible to file or line it, then leave it alone; but if it is not annexed to another tooth, then you must intervene with this instrument which is like a tooth root, and which is made of Indian steel of extremity not too sharp.</start_of_turn
And make your incision with which you intervene with this one in pieces of days for the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not blunt like the others of the teeth.</start_of_turn
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to filing, then file that with a file of Indian steel of the same form.</start_of_turn
And let it be of Indian steel, the mark being seen immediately; and be of such a size that when used with needles, which are useful for this, the tooth is gradually ground down a little every day with ease, so that it is not like another tooth that would fall out.</start_of_turn And do the same with the gums, and grind away that which is between the teeth.</start_of_turn
And if there is a tooth from which a part is fractured and the tongue sticks to it, then you must cover that until the swelling of that part is overcome and the fracture is healed, and be filled so that the tongue does not stick or the word does not corrupt.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXXIII.</start_of_turn
On the restoration of decayed teeth with gold or silver foil.</start_of_turn
When accidents happen to the teeth before percussion and removal by percussion or extraction, and the patient does not suffer from it, and you have cured that with medicinal astringents, and it has not been of any use, then for so that they do not fall out, put gold on those that are strong with gold and not with silver, for silver turns green and soon becomes poor in a few days, even though gold never changes.</start_of_turn
E sia le fiel en tal subtilitat e grocesa secondo la quantità che pervenga entrar tra le dentz; e la forma della rizione è che prenguas le sue denze e prendilo doppio di quelle tra due denti sani, e aprop che cresca am due tortuosità del fiel tra due maugude, o se una o più, entro che pervenga la tela alla denza sana dell'altra parte. E thus keep the thread taut within the area from which you commence, and strengthen your hand and know how to finish without causing damage.
And thus hold your needle so that the thread does not slip from the teeth that you have not passed through
And thus cut away the excess thread with forceps or scissors, and gather those in every place where there is a knot, and convert those and hide them between the healthy tooth and the painful tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue And thus leave that which is stretched like Rome.
More if it is slipped or swollen, strengthen that or those to the other thread in such a manner at all times
And this is the fashion of teeth and the figure of the rectification of two healthy teeth and two painful teeth, thus as sometimes these are linked:
When you have returned a tooth or two, almost in any place, and they are recumbent as we have recommended, and that they remain firm
And do not do anything but a good craftsman and a wise man.
And many remedies are suitable for the causes of the cow's bones, and it is useful for them as a remedy for teeth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is wanting, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains firm and serves for a long time.

Of the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.</start_of_turn>
This ligament which is found behind the tongue has some veins or is natural in which man does not know, or accidentally and accidentally by plague which has already settled.</start_of_turn
And the operation in it is that we burn the mouth of the patient, and take away whatever exists in the belly; and elevate the tongue, and then we cut that ligament nerve according to the breadth until the tongue is freed from its retraction.</start_of_turn
More if in that there is any hardness or denuding, and that it has been established by plague, then you must keep a single hand and split that for the breadth until you have cut through the ligament and the swelling has disappeared.</start_of_turn
And take care that there is no unnecessary fracture in the bone of the heel and that you cut here with care and do not cause blood to flow.</start_of_turn
And thus wash away the remnants of the incision with sponges or with vinegar or with wet cloth; and then leave the tongue free; so that it does not suffer from the pain which the patient has left the tongue in any night so that it is not solidified by another vein.</start_of_turn
More if blood flows, pause over the wet area that has been torn; more if the blood boils, then burn the area with a cautery that agrees with water.</start_of_turn And thus care for the other causes until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the extraction of wisdom from the tongue.</start_of_turn
Some veins happen to leave the tongue after the wisdom tooth has erupted resembling a small knot that hinders the natural operation of the tongue; and often it is greatly inflamed until it fills the mouth.</start_of_turn
And the operation in it is that we burn the mouth of the patient sitting in front of the sun and consider the wisdom tooth.</start_of_turn
And if at times you see yellow or black, hard, to which the patient does not feel pain, then do not touch that which is crooked.</start_of_turn
And if it is inclined to paleness, in which there is humidity, then put on gloves and cut that with a pointed instrument, and cut from the root; and if blood boils at the time of your operation, then pause for a moment, so that the blood is withdrawn, whether it is dry or wet, until it is solidified.</start_of_turn
And thus return to your work until you have completed it with care, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and care for that which is the other care for water until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Capitol .xxxvi.
From the extraction of the appendix of two testicles and of that which is nothing in the bladder and of the other appendages.
When the belly swells up with pain, then the glands that are around the testicles become swollen and are not emptied out by two testicles, which when you touch them in water as we have said in the division, and it is not well, then you must consider if the appendix is hard, of a dark color, with little sensation, for in that case do not touch it with iron.
And if it is of a dark color and the reason is great, then do not touch that with iron for the sake of the remedy; remove that which is within either by surgery or by bringing it out through an opening, or if it breaks by itself.
And if it is of a white color, rather pale, and the reason is slight, then that is that it is not dangerous.
And the operation for it is that you consider, before you make the operation, if the appendix has already rested quietly with a complete rest or if it has diminished somewhat; and when you have made the incision, do not open the belly too wide, but keep the head of the appendix in the belly, and close the mouth of it, and the servant takes between their hands according to the tongue of the patient, leaving aside any noble instrument of which this is the form:
Either of silver or of gold, and be subtle as a coat.</start_turn>
Therefore, when you promise this to the patient and he shows you the appendix, and you touch that on the belly, then take hold of it firmly and leave it in its place, and pull that out to the outside as much as you can.</start_turn And another thing that you must pull out is any cause of the tunics, and then apply that instrument of which this is the form:</start_turn
And another thing that you must pull out is any cause of the tunics, and then apply that instrument of which this is the form:</start_turn And it is assembled like forceps, however the extremities of it are curved, so that the orifice of any of them is in the belly of the other, not pointed, which is of iron without a handle.</start_turn
Or if this instrument is not available, then apply that instrument which is like a sponge: and be sharp from one side, not from the other side.</start_turn<end_turn>
And when you have made an incision, make the other according to this manner of handling, and then keep the incision closed with the hand of the patient, and let the patient drink cold water to ease the pain.</start_turn><end_turn>
Or if there is a flux of remedy, keep cold water of decoction of poppy seed or of marigold leaf, and keep to that of the strict causes until the flux of the remedy is restrained, and care for that which is within until it is well.</start_turn><end_turn
And every vein that goes out of the belly into the other parts of the body, other than those two testicles, and that are not two testicles, are to be incised according to what we have said about the incision of two wounds that are equal.</start_turn><end_turn
And I have already treated a woman who was naturally in the belly of her, whose appendix tended to a dark color, with little sensation, which already closed the belly of her, and the woman breathed with difficulty, and I had prohibited her from eating and drinking anything, and she was already on the verge of death if it had not been for the fact that I intervened for two days.</start_turn><end_turn
And the appendix had already swollen so much that there were two fist-sized lumps within two incisions.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore I sutured it fistulously and remained with one hand on it, and I pulled out the other, and when I had pulled out a great part of it, I applied the other incision to the other wound, and I closed the mouth of it, and I pressed its tongue, and I remained with the hand on the appendix.</start_turn><end_turn
And I pulled out a great part of it, and it did not bleed except for a little bit of blood.</start_turn><end_turn Therefore the belly of that woman is absolutely healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and to eat, so that I did not cease to operate on that appendix for a long time, and there followed other appendicitis in place of that one, which I operated on until it was prolonged for that reason.</start_turn><end_turn
Therefore I went away and cauterized the belly of her, so as to prevent infection; and I remained standing and did not know until later that it was the Lord who had saved me from that.
The end.
From the incision of the hour when it is apoplectic.
When the catarrh descends to the heel, and is acute and long, it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part and round, it is called buba.
When it is cured with that which we have said in the division, and do not grieve over your care, and immediately you perceive that the burn is already almost over and is subtle, then you must know that the swelling is added round; and if it is at that length, and is bloody, of a reddish or blackish color, and is not at a distance, then you must know that you must fear the infection of the wound, for there is fear of the illness.
And when you see it thus according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, that the wound is bad and swells the tongue of the instrument with which you process its form, and then it remains attached to the new one, and you throw away the old one and insert the new one with two instruments which are mentioned in the infection of two wounds.
And you must know that you must not insert it except when it is adjusted according to the natural terms of its addition, for if you insert it too much, you will make it swell even more.
And concerning the infection, use the thing which we have recommended in the infection of two wounds, and care for that until it is healed.
When the wound is wide due to the infection, know that you must use an instrument in the cautery of the wound, for fear that the wound will become wider and deeper.  And do not grasp the wound tightly, but rather gently hold the tongue of the instrument which we have mentioned. And take some water from the head of the cautery and comfort the patient with that. And do not make it swell or become subtle, but rather fill the cavity of the instrument which is the cause of the wound.
Both the extension of the cavity in which the medicine is placed as well as the cavity of the heel of a ray are to be held in the same way.  And place the instrument with the medicine over the nail, and the wound will swell over the teeth so that saliva or mucus from the mouth of the patient runs over the wound for the purpose of lubrication of the medicine, so that it does not fall from that due to any cause from the root of the tooth and that it heals that.
And finally put your hand on the medicine and press it on the uvula for about a quarter of an hour until it is softened and calmed by the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take thread and wrap it around the limb of the ray, and immerse the thread in the medicine, and insert the ray into the thread in a canula so that the thread adheres to that canula, and do that for as many times as necessary until you achieve what you desire from the cautery of the nail, and then remove that so that it dries and falls off naturally in about three or four days.
And if you are instructed to repeat the medicine, repeat that, and after the cautery has been completed, remove the burn from the nail bed to the border, and mix that which is in the circuit of the medicine, and let that which is in the circuit of the medicine be washed with clean water, and keep it cured with ointment, and keep the patient under guard until it is healed
And this kind of care is more safe than an infection and is longer in time.
Certain remedies are cured by the uvuola with something more subtle than cautery and infection, which is cured by subfumigation in this manner: take camomile, rue, origan, rosemary, pounded Arabic gum, chamomile, broth and similar herbs, and mix all these causes together, or some of them, in a ball, and immerse them in vinegar. Let the vinegar be lukewarm and let there be a little space in the middle of the ball where an instrument can be placed according to this manner; let it be made of silver or gold.
And let the limb be placed in the mouth of the wound while the vapor makes the uvuola rise over the canula, until the uvuula is not opaque.
And do that again over the swelling until it is dry, and take care that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the swelling, for it would be too tight on the swelling, and do not think you must perform it, but rather declare the swelling of the wound.
Or if you do not have this instrument, then take a tube and put on the limb of the ray a seal of oil, so that the mouth of the wound is covered, for the seal of oil prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
This treatment is good for health.

Of the extraction of thorns and of that which adheres to the root and of the other causes.
Cold humors adhere to the groin or heel or any other cause.
Once you have extracted what appears to be the cause, look at it carefully, for you must swear by your tongue with the instruments at hand that what you see is the cause of the pain
And what is not seen and is hidden in the groin, make the patient vomit the disease before the food is digested in the stomach, for the cause of the disease that is in the groin will be expelled with the vomit; or that he swallow the disease with a gulp of wine or some barley or a spoonful of bread; or that he expels it with a sponge of marine sponge that is firmly bound with thread, and that you confirm this with your hand, for as soon as the spine is pricked in the place where it is extracted, the pain is expelled. Or take an eel and bind it firmly, and when you have pricked the table and have grasped the hand that is to be extracted; or take a nail and grasp the heel and grasp the foot firmly.
Or if you do not expel those causes which we have mentioned, then use a plum instrument in this way:
And make it thicker than a little, and in the evacuation of the limb there is a cavity which you must enter into the belly with ease
And the patient should keep his head elevated on his thighs, and take care that you do not touch the genitals or the heel, or that any other attendant put their hand on them, or that the physician put their hand on them.</start_turn>
However, if the disease is more severe, for its knowledge of the place of the annexed cause and its extraction in it, pull your hand away from the instrument in his hand, as much as is required until it is expelled.</start_turn

Of the extraction of gangrene annexed to the groin.
When gangrene is treated with medications as we have said in the division of the cure with medicines and it does not suffice, consider the cause of the disease in the groin of the patient from sunrise to sunset, for you have compressed the patient's tongue with the instrument which you have recommended.</start_turn><end_turn>
Therefore if you sometimes see gangrene, extract that which is once small or which is between the toes adequately.</start_turn><end_turn>
And if you are unable to extract that, take a curved needle and enter that into the groin of the patient, and when you have placed it in the hollow of the needle put a burning iron there, and do so until the gangrene is dead and comes out of the groin.
And give him a sponge full of fresh water, and put his mouth in that, and wash his mouth with that; and do not swallow anything from that cause and make the water flow for an hour or two with your hand, so that the gangrene will depart as soon as the water comes out.</start_turn><end_turn
Or if it is not expelled with what we have recommended, then suffocate the patient with the thumb or with the instrument which we have recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.</start_turn><end_turn
Do thus, so that he will die.
And another manner of operation in the fumigation of this is that you take a bowl in which are lit coals and cover the bowl with a cover in the middle of which is a tube, and put the extremity of the instrument in that tube; and when you have kindled the coals, remove the cover; and place the patient’s mouth over the extremity of the needle, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you see that the fumigation has reached the gangrene, for the gangrene will depart as soon as the fumigation is over.</start_turn><end_turn
And if it does not depart, then repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and feed him with salt and broth, and do not let him drink water, and if necessary keep him away from this regimen for a long time.</start_turn><end_turn
And this is the form of the instrument with which gangrene of the groin is treated; it is similar to forceps in this way as well as in others, except that it has some curvature: which is placed on the groin, and the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which the thumb is grasped, so that when any cause is pressed, that does not slip away.</start_turn><end_turn

In which the sum of the word is in the perception of apoplexy and in section of them.
The apoplexy is a mobile species, of mobile habits, according to the remembrance of them, from some of this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and section of them by two habits, of which one is for the species of apoplexy in itself; and for what they compress of humors.
And the second habit is that of the places in which the accidents of the body occur, because the apoplexy that occurs in the head is different from the one that occurs in the buttocks; and the one that occurs in the fleshy part is different from the one that occurs in the joints; and each one of them is its judgment for the operation
And there are some apoplexy that must not be perforated except at the proper maturity of the patient in those or alongside them
So other apoplexy that must be cauterized when they are crossed, and are not mature according to their complement, as well as those that are proximate to the joints, for an apoplexy that is near a joint, the more it is prolonged until it is poor within the circle of its limit, and the more it corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because it is a cause of contraction of that limb; or it is an apoplexy that is close to a principal limb, and if you delay the perforation of it until it is mature, it does not benefit the principal limb; or it is close to the buttocks, so perforate it only when it is not mature; and do not perforate it cruelly, except for non-compliance of digestion, but only that which is close to the buttocks, so that you do not weaken the cushion of the buttocks and that it is elongated towards the lower parts of the buttocks, and that there is a fistula, or that it is finished in the end that it is not healthy.</end_of_turn> It is better that you know the time of the perforation of the apoplexy, and that is when it is mature.</end_of_turn>
And you know that it is mature when there is the cessation of pain and the cessation of fever, and alongside the decrease of swelling and pulse, and the increase in the sharpness of the head of the apoplexy, and the other signs.</end_of_turn>
And it is better that you know the perforation to take place in the least painful place of the apoplexy and where the cure comes from the prominence.</end_of_turn>
And the perforation must be made throughout the limb or the body, if the apoplexy is in the parts of the face or the feet, and in the place of lacerations, of nerves, of arteries; and finally, in all the places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use perforation according to that limb.</end_of_turn
When the apoplexy is in the fleshy part, it is better that you wait for the digestion of it to be confirmed according to the complement before you perforate it, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, it is prolonged the suffering of the patient and great pain, and the lips of the limb become hardened and deep.</end_of_turn
Some apoplexy must be perforated according to the latitude of the limb or the body due to the necessity, or according to what the limb digests.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary to administer a small perforation, and in large apoplexy a wide or multiple incision according to the diversity of the size of the apoplexy.</end_of_turn
And others are the apoplexy in which it is necessary that the cord be concave and inflamed, when it is convenient as well as when it is finished that it already stays, as well as that which occurs in the groin and the swelling of the testicles.</end_of_turn
And of those that are incised with section having three angles; and of those that are incised like a laurel leaf, like the apoplexy of the spleen.</end_of_turn
And of those that are administered circular section and lunar section, and they resemble the others.</end_of_turn
And concerning that to which it is not capable as lions, with superficial apostemas, it is necessary that you perforate the one that is not superficial, or plane only.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary that when the apoplexy is great and has collected a lot of pus, that you perforate it and do not hesitate to extract all the pus in that moment; having extracted from it a part, and almost immediately put the apoplexy back into the other day, and extract another part greater, and make it so that little by little it is evacuated according to degrees until it is completely gone.</end_of_turn
And more if the patient is of cold temperament, or woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old man in decrepitude, for the animal spirit is resolved with the evacuation of the pus, and it is better for the patient, and you must perform the operation.</end_of_turn
Keep this chapter with great caution, and when you pierce this abscess, cover that you remove the pus and consider whether the abscess of the abscess is little or is a flat section, for in the former case you administer the lesser of the two; and if the abscess is great and the rents of the perforation are abundant, cover that you stop making marks until they come together.
And if in the abscess there is a part of the kidney or you have softened that in the circumference, cover that you strengthen it with old cloth or with thread made of silk, just as when you carry burdens or slices of bread or cheese, because of the humidity; and stretch it within the third day; and when you have finished, treat it as before until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Even if blood flows out during your operation, cover that you administer cold water and vinegar in which to soak a cloth of silk, and place that over the area of the flow of blood that is bleeding profusely.</end_of_turn>
Even if the bleeding persists, cover that you administer regulations and care and powders that I have recommended in many places of this our book and division.</end_of_turn>
Even if it is winter, and the place of the abscess is a place of many nerves, cover that you sprinkle vinegar in wine and oil, and place those on the places.</end_of_turn
And if it is summer, and the places are fleshy, cover that you sprinkle powders in meat with water and oil or in wine and oil, and keep that moist until the third day, as we have said, and cover that you remove the abscess and evacuate that and administer in the care of it whatever is necessary until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of the care of abscesses universally, more especially according to the way of distinguishing that I have already said of all abscesses in whatever way they are to be treated according to the chapters singly.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 61.</end_turn>
Of the incision of abscesses that occur in the kidney of the head.</end_turn
In the kidney of the head there are small abscesses, and so of species of nodes which contain tunics that are made like that; and the species of them are abundant.</end_turn
And from them there are drops, and from those that contain humidity similar to lime.</end_of_turn And from those that contain humidity similar to urine, and resembling to lentils; and from those that are soft and slippery.</end_of_turn
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as you must know the extension of those does not do harm to the artery.</end_of_turn
And the operation in the incision of those is that you remove them with an instrument of the form that you see that I have mentioned, which is called tweezers, until you see that it contains.</end_of_turn
For if that which contains is humidity, cover that you cut that by incision following the length by superficial incision in this way:</end_turn
And begin in the incision of the line of B to the line of G. When the humidity is evacuated, cover that you will remove that for which that humidity contains, and do not leave from that any cause of that, for if it remains from that any cause.
And immediately immerse the limb in Egyptian unguents, if present, or in water and salt; and fill that with that the abscess and leave that until the next day, for that which is in that will be eaten away by that water.</end_of_turn
And immediately repeat over that limb with Egyptian unguents according to the second and third time if you perceive that it is useful, until you are confident that there is no longer any cause of that abscess; cover that you care for the abscess with that unguent until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, cover that you will incision that in this way:</end_turn with a cut without form of cross, and take nails between two lips of the incision and run that from all parts, and exert your skill in the extraction of the tunic that contains that.</end_turn
Even if your artery does you harm, cover that you will say that you will report that to me first.</end_turn
And in the same way do in the abscess of incision and care as we have said; and the incision of the abscess that is liquid is lighter, because it is of little blood and little humidity.</end_turn
Every vein sometimes carries humors which are dry and cold in the head of men, who are of a dry and cold temperament; and this causes that we are unable to perceive a pulse on the head of an old woman. We therefore cover the pulse with lead, just as we do with stone, lead, white, rough, and dull, which cannot be drunk up, and if any of these should be struck at that point, it swells that area.
More often in other parts of the head there is another kind of pulse which is not like this one; just as there are pulses at the heads of children and the reason is the softness of the bones, more the section of these is superficial.
And stop the perforation of those below so that the body of the patient is relieved in those below.
And take care of those things which are necessary for that of caregiving
Chapter 52.</start_of_turn>
Of the section of scrofulas which happen in the groin.
These veins carry these humors to the groin, the buttocks, and the armpits; and sometimes to other parts of the body.
And so those which happen in the groin, and those which are engendered between them, and all scrofula of these is without its own tunic, just as in the nodes and pulse of the head, as we have recounted
And the species of these scrofulas are veins, which are some of them soft, and some which contain humors, and some which are malignant which do not yield to caregiving
Therefore in that place where you sometimes have a good disposition in the touch, of which the colour of the liquid which appears is appropriate to the colour of codliver oil, and is bad for all, and is not connected with the nerves of the groin, nor with the veins, nor with the arteries, and is not a swelling, because you perceive it only on the superficial part of the part under that of the body below the line of G. within the line of B., and scrape that from all over, and spread two lips of the codliver oil on both sides, or on many if you need them, as we have said concerning the pulse of the head, and extract that little by little.</start_of_turn>
And be more careful not to damage the vein or nerve.</start_of_turn
And let the spatum not be too sharp, that you do not damage your hand with your incision, or that you irritate the patient, and that you do not inflict anything which is not necessary to inflict; for if you inflict the vein or artery you will prevent your operation, for when you pull out the wet swab there remain other clots which impede the flow of blood, and open the wound, and leave that in until the pain of the swelling has passed and the wound has become softened and the swelling has gone down.</start_of_turn When the blood is evacuated.</start_of_turn
Therefore return to your operation until you have completed it.</start_of_turn
And inquire concerning the belly whether there is any cause of the other small scrofulas, so incisions those and drain them.</start_of_turn
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover that so that you do not injure that scrofula in its root.</start_of_turn Be careful that you hold that firmly doubled strong and that you leave that until it falls by itself spontaneously.</start_of_turn
And fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian unguents, and take care of that.</start_of_turn
And if you have incised that scrofula entirely, cover that so that you can adjust the two lips of the wound and keep them so that there is no redundancy.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes there is redundancy due to the greatness of the scrofula, cover that so that you can understand how to incision the root of that, and remove that and administer suture and what is said.</start_of_turn
And those which contain humors, pierce that with a superficial perforation here where you perceive the seat of the pulse of the patient, and stop perforating of that which would cause the pus to flow from the lower part of the body, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And give perforation, keep wet in the ointment and resembling those, so that it runs away what is remaining of the corruption.</start_of_turn And when the wound has already become softened, then care for that which is generated in the ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Say so the ancients, that this incision in the heel has never been seen in our land to have succeeded.
This is the inscription of the sermon of those people.
May it be in the homes that there has been no quenching, cover that the extraction of the heel be avoided, because it does not help in this case that all the veins and the greater part of the disease is here
May it be in those who have apophyses caused in the mouth or heel or two spurs, when the disease is not in the vein, cover to use the incision of the heel to escape the loss which is useful for perforation.
Therefore, when you wish to do it, let them cut the heel leaving three circles of the circles of the heel, or four at a small distance from each other for the width in that which there are two circles in quantity, that the incision be in cartilage, not in the bone, and that this place is suitable for incision, for it is free from flesh and the vessels of the sanctity are left whole
And if the doctor is timid, cover that he extend the tendon of the heel from the heel bone all the way to the canal, but avoid the vessels of sanctity if you see any of them, for any cause.
And do as we have recommended; and it is significant about the incision of the canal for the spasm which is from that swelling which is in that place that is broken and for the bruising of the voice
And leave the wound open for a while.
Therefore, when the hour is ripe in which perforation is feared, add two layers of fat to the edge of the wound, and when that alone remains, only the cartilage.
And give medicines that make the flesh disappear until it is healed.
And say Albucasis that the sum of the sermon that we have recommended, exposure is nothing but to see that some of these apophyses have already paralyzed the heel of the disease, and the disease is overcome within death, and the flesh is separated from it, and some go to incision the epiglottis so that the disease breathes over the location of the wound for any breath, and is saved from death.
And thus I command to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease is consumed; and the malice is of it for three days; and therefore I command you to close the wound when the disease is healed.
And what I have seen for my own purpose, is that a servant brought a bowl and poured into it half of the heel of the foot and cut with that a part of the bone of the ankle, and I was called to the care of it, and I covered the blood with the same as it is emitted from a corpse, and I uncovered the wound and covered the blood with the same as it is emitted from the wound a little.
Therefore I confess that I did not cut any veins or nerves, and that the blood came from the wound, and I cured that until it healed.
And I did not touch the servant if she did not recover in her voice, and thus it is said that she returned well of her ailments
And thus I say that in the incision of the heel there is no fear

From incision over the apophysis that happens in the heel outwards, and is called hernia of the heel.
This great apophysis which is called hernia of the heel is great according to the color of the limb, and is not in the women.
And there are two methods, which is either natural or accidental
And in the natural one it is not the work of healing
And the accidental one is by two methods of which one is like grass knots, and the other method is like an apophysis which is caused by the clotting of an artery, and in that one there is fear And do not presume to do it with iron except in that which is small And you will prove that and investigate that which I have said, and if you find it like grass knots, and it is not suspended by any veins, then you will cut that just as if it were a knot, and extract that with that which is under the skin and the fat; and if not, the hour is prescribed that all the limb is inspected, and that you take care of the area with that which covers the care until it is healed

From the nodes so many species and I have already said all the species of them in the division.
And that I recommend to know the difference between node and exitura so that there is no doubt
Therefore I say that the exitura is a quality of heat, fever, and sharp pains until the ebullition of the humors is calmed; and it is completed by putrefaction when the fever, the pain, and the heat cease to exist
But the node is neither heat nor fever nor pain, but rather that which is in the head or sac itself
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a cheese and is like this when it goes away, whether greater or less, and is according to two species, which are either fatty or contain moisture, and the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the care of the node, that you expel the one and ask about the beginning that is called internal, according to its form that comes in this capital which is nearby
And it is a way of inquiring about apostemas and all nodes, that you take hold of this pain and bring that one to the most humid place that you find in the apostema, and you will withdraw the strings said with that little by little until you know that the pain has already penetrated the cordena.
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the greatness of the apostema, and extract the internal parts and consider what is left of them
And if the current humors are expelled, whatever their color, then you should cut them superficially according to what I have said in the other apostemas.
And if there is no moisture left from the internal parts, then you know that it is fat
And dry it over it in the shape of a cross according to this form: as I have taught you, and suspend that which is on nails, and remove the cord from all around easily, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract that pus from the node
However, if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and many other things are seen inside that, and you will extract it piece by piece until no cause remains of it
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node returns according to the most.
And if sometimes there remains any small part, then complete the wound with several corrosive powders that are sharp and strengthen the wound, and keep it over that which is the apostema of cautery, and care for the other wound until it is healed
And if the node is great, then you must split its lips and care for that which encloses it
However, if there is a pulsatile swelling at the opposite, or non-pulsatile, then you must cover it and keep the place of the wound of the split hair that is old and rough, and apply that plaster for two days or three until the wound is healed and the swelling of the abscess has gone down; and then return to incision what is left of the node.

Of the forms of the pains necessary in the incision and perforation
Of those are the forms of the internal parts, and there are three species, of which the greatest is of them, and the middle is of them, and the least is of them
The form of the great internal is like this:
The form of the least internal is like this
They are useful for iron, for aloes, for fallen extremities conveniently, so that they fix the instruments in the apostemas
And these are the forms of the experienced, and they are called albered, and one of them is called berid.
And there are three species, of which one is great, one is middle, and one is small
The form of the great experience is like this
The form of the middle experience is like this
The way of experiencing little, the way of them:
I understand that these are post-traumatic changes, exits of boils, fistulas and abscesses, so that between these there are bones and other causes.
And so it is found that redounds, bruises, leeches, wasps, as well as great needles with which the threads are sewn, are caused by yellow bile, or by blood, or by iron, or by silver, and a thousand other things are caused by yellow bile
And they are caused by the experience of black plum, which are remembered that for these the fistulas are opened in the cavity of which they are reflected, that is reflected from their elevation to those reflections
And so of three kinds, some of which are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the stricture of it.
The way of experiencing a great deal of plum:
The way of experiencing a medium amount of plum
The way of experiencing a little amount of plum
The forms of nails are of several kinds, which are some simple nails, which have only one curvature, and three kinds: great, few and medium.
And of these there are blunt nails, and three kinds.
And of these there are nails that have two curvatures, and three kinds
And of these there are nails that have three curvatures, and three kinds.
And all of these are necessary in their place

The shape of a great nail having two curvatures The shape of a medium nail having two curvatures The shape of a little nail having two curvatures
The shape of a great nail having three curvatures
The shape of a medium nail having three curvatures
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scorched, and there are three kinds, which are great, medium and little.
The shape of a great scalpel
The shape of a medium scalpel
The shape of a little scalpel
The extremities of those on which the incision is made are acute and the others are not acute, and they are not to be grasped in such a way, but rather to be aided in the excision of the nodes, in order to avoid injuring a vein or nerve, and for those that it may be healthy and quiet for a little while after the excision of the abscess
These are the forms of dressings, and there are three kinds: great, medium and little, like herbs.
They are caused by blood and resemble a ray on which alcohol is made.
And it is in the limb punctured with sponge soaked in oil, and in which runs to the parts surrounding the head and the shoulder, when you want, like seeing it
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers of the hand that makes the perforation of the abscesses and do not perceive the pains, and there are three kinds: great, medium and little These are the forms of those things:
The various airs that cause the flow of blood to be obstructed, and which are of three species; great, medium, and small; the forms of them:
They are of citrus type, round in any length, and are subtle.
And it is necessary that these three species of winds should be great, medium, and small, because by these they cause the blood to flow too quickly, which is not medicine at first hand.</start_of_turn>
But do not use them to obstruct blood throughout the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places, such as the veins of the limbs and the buttocks, and the veins of the chest, the abdomen, and the groin, and resembling the fleshy veins that are humidy.</start_of_turn
And many other herbs are useful for these instruments, such as small things resembling fish scales according to this form; for which the blood is obstructed when it is caused by phlegm, or by incision of a vein or artery.</start_of_turn

Some herbs cause the breasts of men to swell due to the lack of sleep as soon as they begin to become pale, and so they swell the breasts, and they are assembled the breasts of women, and remain moist.
And to anyone who suffers from this, it is necessary to make an incision with a lunar section according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and remove the whole tumor, and replace the wound with a medicinal poultice, and secure the edges of the wound with sutures, and care for that which is within so that it may be healed.</start_of_turn
And if the breast hangs downwards towards the thighs and is softened by its size as it does in women, when it is necessary to cut it in two lateral parts even if it is large, according to two lunar sections, of which each contains the other at the end of each, until the major line contains the smaller according to this form of the line of B and the line of G. And so remove the cord that is between the two edges of the wound, and keep the swelling down, and administer what has been said of the sutures and the dressings that are necessary for healing within that which is necessary.</start_of_turn
And if you do not comply with the incision of what you must cut to calm the patient and the flow of blood, it is necessary that you immerse the wound in corrosive ointment and leave it until the fat that is left is consumed, and care for that which is within so that it is healed.</start_of_turn

And so keep the wound closed both before and after with convenient ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn

More on that which is from them for inflammation of the orifice of the arteries, split in the median section in the loin; and immediately cover the split with a clamp and hold the artery, and drain the tunics until it is discovered.</end_of_turn>
And immediately put on that needle and make that penetrate through to the other side, and tighten the artery with a firm double knot in two places, — which causes your eye to be extinguished in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
And immediately put a point in the place which is between two ligaments at a stretch until it escapes all that is in them, and dissolve the abscess.</end_of_turn
And immediately administer treatment in which poor blood is engendered until the ligaments are let down; and immediately treat that which is convenient at any time until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it is an abscess due to a vein cut, then cover that you must have your hand there where the abscess is at the median; and immediately insert the needle without leaving the place where you had your hand, and make that penetrate; and in that fold double until you extract that from the other side, and immediately ligate the abscess with good liament as I have said above in the case of two parts of two extremities of the fold.</end_of_turn>
More if you fear that you will extract the fold, then immediately insert the wire with that needle without leaving the whole abscess from the incision of the first needle, and strengthen the threads in four places.</end_of_turn
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until when it is sitting there that the incision has escaped what is in it, then immediately insert the clamp into the median of the artery and leave what is bound.
And immediately rest on the powder which you have moistened in wine and oil, and immediately administer the treatment which is useful with calmness and with grease until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter of the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.</end_of_turn>
Thus when an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, and similarly when it occurs in nerves when they are struck or when there is excessive work, and for a similar reason.</end_of_turn
And it is useful more in the places of the assistants or the thigh, or in any place where there are many joints.</end_of_turn
And the abscess is hard, and is like that of the other body, and is in the greatest of them when it is full of blood and when it is stretched violently, sitting in it the disease resembling stupor.</end_of_turn
And it is not an abscess which is added in the front of the body, but for so it is left the median, and the blood is ejected from all parts and does not go to the preceding or following parts.</end_of_turn
Therefore in those who are in the joints it is not necessary to encase them with iron, which would cause them to contract strongly.</end_of_turn
More in the head or in the front of the neck at a stretch.</end_of_turn More if it is a little abscess, then immediately tell them of the forcepts and cut that one out for the reason.</end_of_turn
And if it is great, then immediately suspend it with a hook, and drain that one, and immediately hold that one; and suture the wound with a suture, and treat that until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the incision of an abscess which occurs from the heel that occurs to the belly.</end_of_turn
Thus in the buttocks of those who are sitting and in the other parts of the body of those who are exposed to fungi because of their resemblance to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and already the lips of those are converted, and it is of those that is small, and it is of those that is not magnificent.</end_of_turn
And I have already seen one in the belly of which there were two patients who were greater than fungi resembling them, and there was no difference between those whites, of meager root.</end_of_turn
The lips of those people were swollen and puffed out, and moisture ran from them all the time.
So I intervened with them and put on a poultice in one of their feet which was very painful indeed.</end_of_turn> and the other which was very painful indeed.</end_of_turn>
And the operation for the incision of them is that you consider if the disease is humid, and if the color of the boils is white, humid, of subtle origin; then you will make points with a spatula and cauterize in the fire, for when the boils are evacuated the wound will be expelled whole; if you leave it open, cauterize it again.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes the disease is mild and fearful, guard yourself from incision with iron; more the hours you stay firm of recent burn, and strengthen that boil, the manner of which is that which we have mentioned; and read that for two days.</end_of_turn
Then adjust on the stricture of the thread of burn; therefore, do not cease strengthening the burn greatly until it is separated and falls by itself from its work.</end_of_turn
More if it is of great origin, the hours in the incision of them is some cause of fear and pain, especially in that which is in the belly.</end_of_turn
More perhaps you will cut off the majority of them, and then cauterize that so that it does not return.</end_of_turn
And then care for that until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn>
And keep in mind that you do not presume to incides those which are of yellow color, of little sensation, of regular legs, for those are abscesses.</end_of_turn
And I remember with great concern this matter.</end_of_turn

Of the care of the navel.</end_of_turn>
The navel is swollen for various causes; or for tears of the sac which is over the belly, and these are to be closed with thread or buld as in other ruptures; or for the healing of which blood or pus flows out according as it is said before, or for cramped wind in it.</end_of_turn
More if it is for a tear of the sac and for swelling of the thread, the color of the pus is similar to the color of the body; and it is like a lion in its pain, and it appears in various situations.</end_of_turn And if it is for the evacuation of the intestine, the hours its situation is like that which we have recounted, more diverse in many ways, and as you promised that which we told you is hidden, and return; and it is very strong in it, and is magnified more by the introduction of bath and violent work.</end_of_turn
More if it is for humidity, the hours is like a lion and is not hidden when you put your hand on it, neither is it constricted, neither is it wrinkled.</end_of_turn
And if it is for healing, the hours appears like dark streaks declining.</end_of_turn
More if it is for nothing, the hours is thick, fat and hard, and remains according to a quantity.</end_of_turn
More if it is for wind, the hours touch it like a lion.</end_of_turn
And the operation for it is that you consider if the swelling of the navel is for the healing of an artery or a vein, or for wind; that you must abstain from the care of it, for in that there is fear and pain just as we have taught in the chapter in which we said that the pus is for an artery and a vein.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling of the navel is for the intestine or for the thread, the hours command the patient that has the pain to lie still and be extended; and command to him to sit between your hands over the two thighs, and to surround with a spatula the part of the navel where you have mentioned the attempt; and to extend the mass of the pus towards the lower parts with a thumb; and to tie in the circuit with a strong or weak thread and the decent manner of the liar.</end_of_turn
And then bring out the palm of the hand with the extended pus over the ligament and insert your finger into that place and ask for the intestine; and if you have found it neither held by the ligament, the hours extract it and expel the intestine from the parts of the belly.</end_of_turn
And if you have found the thread, the hours take that which is whole; and incisions the supernumeraries.</end_of_turn
May it be contrary to your surgery or vein, when the roundness of that matter has been completed, and having returned to your operation, take two needles and pierce through those two holes firmly, and insert two needles into the circumference which you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which shall penetrate; and then strengthen the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, leave the needles in place and let the extended tissue rest until it falls off by itself; or incision it when it is subtle and it falls away, and then care for that which is around it until it is healed
And if the swelling of the navel is due to nothing in it or moisture, it is necessary that you cover the abscess just as we have said and extract the dirt or moisture which you find in it, and then care for that which is around it and that consolidates the area

Care of wounds.
We have already said, in the division, about the different types of wounds and how to care for them with medicines, and it is harmful to them to care for them with iron so that they are not ulcerated; and we have said that wounds are produced in the summer and caution in the care of them
And the ancients say that many wounds are in places where it is impossible to eradicate them, just as for wounds which are in the breasts or in the buttocks and remain on the limbs allocated to remove everything, and especially when they are small at the beginning
When it is old and hard, do not attempt to remove it yourself, for I have never seen it heal from that wound nor have I seen another, nor that it should be overcome by water.
And the operation for it is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede by laying the patient down and purging of black bile several herbs, and then apply ointment, if it is found to be present.
And prepare the patient in the preparation in which it is located for the operation, and then prohibit in the wound a few nails which cover that; and then drain from all parts around the wound until no trace remains of the cause of the wound Let the wound run its course, and do not cut it open unnecessarily, and express the places, and dry the wound thoroughly with your hand or with an instrument
When it is contrary to the course of the wound to make a large incision of a vein or an artery, then cauterize that from which the flow of the wound has ceased, and then care for that which remains of the other care until it is healed

Care of hydropics.
We have already mentioned in the division about the different types of hydropics of water, and their signs, and the care of them with medicines
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of althites alone, and it is not approached with iron to the species of tympanists or to the species of yposarcha, because that is deadly
When you have medicated this species of tympanic hydropic with medicines and do not relieve the pain, consider that if the patient has already achieved debility, or is affected by another disease, just as if it were in the head or in the chest and resembling those, do not medicate with iron, for fear of that
When sometimes the patient has excessive vomiting, and there is no other disease but simple hydropic, neither young nor old, the manner of the operation for it is that you elevate the patient between your knees, and express for him the contents of his stomach with your hand, filling the water to the part beyond the fifth, and take a sponge sponge in this way:
both in two sharp parts long, as with a sponge; however, do this gradually in small parts, so that in the operation there is no passage into the belly, and that you leave that behind
And consider if the generation of hydropic is from the bowels, for in that case you must remove the navel with three fingers from the parts beyond the fifth, in the space of that over the fifth
When the generation of hydropic is for a disease of the spleen, then your incision should be to the left of the navel for three fingers.
When the generation is from the liver, then your incision should be in the flank
And do not let the section be over the cost on which you will make the patient cough, so that the superfluous matter does not run to that frail place.
And now pierce with the instrument throughout the wound, and enter into that section, and raise your hand over the sputum between the wound and the stomach, and you will remove that; and if there is the quantity of a nail or something like that.</end_of_turn>
And now pierce the bladder until the sputum reaches the place where the water is.</end_of_turn> And now extract that and insert an instrument of this shape: and it is like a silver cannula; it is made of silver or ivory or lead, and in the lower part of it there is a small hole, and on the sides there are three holes: two from one side and one from the other side; and the end of it is blunt as a pen, as it is sometimes:
And at the end of it is an arm, so that when the instrument reaches the water, then as much liquid as possible is evacuated from the wound immediately, for if you evacuate less than that in an hour, then for a long time the patient will suffer from the resolution of the spirit animal, or from injuries to the five senses that is very close to death.</end_of_turn>
More should be evacuated according to the quantity of the virtue of the patient and according to what you understand from the patient's virtue and the strength of the patient.</end_of_turn>
And now extract the instrument, and retain the water which is the cause of this, for it is retained by the wound which retains the hole that is on the bladder from which it came.  And you are commanded to perforate it in that manner.</end_of_turn
And do the same again the next day several times if the patient tolerates it, and evacuate a small quantity of water, and do this for several days for fear, and take care that there remains no more water except a little.</end_of_turn
But if you fear about the patient, and you see that there is a great quantity of water, then cure that which is buried in the cold sand, and moisten it with bath, and in the sun wait for a long time; and cure that which is with drying medicines until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And cauterize over the stomach, and the meatus and the intestines near the evacuation of the water, as I have recounted concerning this matter.</end_of_turn

Concerning the care of children who are born with unperfected bladders.</end_turn
Some of the children are like this because they are born from their mother's womb and the head of their bladder is not perforated (or it is slightly torn or is not in its place).</start>
Therefore it is necessary to cover as much as is born with water as gently as possible according to this manner.</start
And near the hole insert a lead nail and bind it, and keep it for three days or for three quarters.</start
And when they want to urinate, let them urinate; and then return that.</start
And if you do not keep the lead nail in, it is possible that the urine that goes over the place will not be able to pass through this hole.</start
But if the hole is small, it should be treated with a lead nail, as we have said, for three days before it becomes enlarged.</start
But those in which the hole is not in its place, that is to say, those in whom the cause is that the bladder is born with the head of the bladder closed, so that it cannot urinate downwards, until you elevate the bladder with your hand to the upper parts; and this is not due to the semen, for it does not reach the womb according to the rule, and is a bad disease that does not leave its mark.</start
The method of the operation in them is that the patient should be placed on his side, and with your left hand extend the head of the bladder outwards with violent extraction, and pierce the head of the bladder of the place of the navel with a sharp instrument, as if it were written with a pen, or whatever part you like, so that the meatus becomes similar to the head of the bladder and the hole falls into the right place as you cover.</start
Take care that in your operation for the flow of urine, that no accidents occur during the process; and keep it away from the patient until the wound has closed, and cure the wound until it has healed.</start
Capitol .lvi.
From the swelling which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis and from corruption and blackness and adhesion of the prepuce at the head of the penis.
These swellings appear in the testicles and are an indication of chronic inflammation of the testicles.
And of these two, one is malignant and the other is not.
Not malignant, because you suspend it with a single thread and cut off the one that comes out whole; and then you stop over that groove submerging it in unguents of Egyptian origin; and then you will cure him of that which lasts for a day.
And if the swelling is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer cautery at the root of the testicles and in the ratio of the testicles.
Maybe if the swelling is in the prepuce at the head of the penis not circumcised, and a part of the swelling is inward and the other part is outward, then you must stay with the swelling which is inward until it is solidified; and when you have cured that which is outward, because when you have cured that the prepuce will not be torn.
And already in the genitals and in the prepuce there is blackness and corruption, where you must conquer all that has already become degenerate and that has already become corrupted or that has already become corrupt; and then apply pressure over that until you have made it soft, which is composed of millet flour and poppy seeds and millet dust and hair.
And thus you will cure the other cure when it is healed.
Maybe if there is an overflow of urine, then you must administer lunar cautery in this way:
because the cautery which is useful is two-fold, both for the overflow of urine and for the plague when it is corrupted
And if the head of the penis is corroded and is destroyed at once, then you must insert into the meat of the prepuce a a plum catheter so that the patient can urinate through that.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion does not occur except in that of which the prepuce is soft, and over which circumcision is not required; and when it occurs adhesion by plague or by swelling) you must scrape with an obtuse spatula until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed throughout.)
And if it is difficult to remove them [adhesion of prepuce to the head of the penis] you must scrape with a spatula over the head of the penis and the prepuce, and so it is that when the prepuce is soft it is easily perforated for its softness.
And then you must separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a strip of fine silk, which is already wet in the cold water so that it does not adhere to any other swelling
And you must keep it treated with vinegar until it is solidified.
The swelling has become acute and gangrenous, so you must cut off the prepuce with cautery at the root and in the ratio of the testicles.
Concerning the circumcision of children and the care of those who have undergone circumcision
Circumcision is not a solution to continuous suffering like other diseases: indeed, even if it is our operation and our will, and since it is to be done in children, it is necessary that we assign in that moment a better operation and a gentler way of suffering loss of health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not decree circumcision in any of their laws, because they did not use it, and it is only because we have learned through experience that the majority of doctors and barbers use circumcision and mutilation with new and curious instruments; and they use thread and incision with the nail.
And I myself have tried all these methods and I do not approve of any mutilation with forceps, thread and nail which, since the veins flee from the wound, which the wound of the prepuce is doubled, and the tone is left behind, and is forced by another incision and severe pain. And the digital mutilation which is useful for almsgiving is sufficient, of which use the barbers, is not followed by the incision of the extremity of the viril member, for that is strong enough to enter the cavity of it
Therefore in the operation with the nail, which is strong enough to see, corrupts your operation And the cord of the child is short by nature, and many swellings do not happen in this way that they require mutilation, and I have seen that.</end_of_turn>
The body is made up of various humors, which can cause pain when they are cold and penetrate every part of the body. In such cases, when pain occurs in the feet, doctors usually call it gout.
The manner of performing the first operation is that you must make the child feel more relaxed if he is of those who understand little, do not make him suffer unnecessarily, but merely tie the ligature in his vein only, and that you will observe whether he is better or worse the next day.
And thus you will make him rejoice in every way that is possible for you, with regard to what he receives of intelligence. And thus you will make him remain calm and prepared, and do not be ignorant; and hide the forfexes in your hand or on the patient's foot, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.
And thus put your hand on the vein and blow in the cord, and pull out that which is in the root of the vein, and thus modify that which is added to it from behind.
The way of making the forfexes for modification is as follows:
One should make the handle of the forfex blunt and the blade sharp, so that the thumb does not slip from the claw, and that the length of the two acute angles is equal to the length of two fingers together
The greatest error in modification is that the intrinsic cord of the whole should not be broken, or part of it should not be cut from the incision
Therefore you must extend that from your hand towards your nail before making the incision and that you make the incision according to equality
And if you cannot hold it on your nail, then extract that with a clamp and make the incision there.
And if three days have passed, and the swelling of the vein has subsided, then you will read that it has receded from the incision; and extract that which is prepared with ease, and make the incision as you are prepared.
And take care of the head of the vein, so that it does not go away from it
Therefore take care of that which has been recommended in the treatise of the powders concerning the consolidation of the powders
And if the cord is incised beyond measure, and you obey the parts that are left over, then you will not notice it to them.
And thus take care of that which has been said until now that it is healed
Chapter 58.
On the care of retained urine in the bladder.
Retained urine in the bladder is caused by excessive fullness due to stones or by sand, or for poverty or for meat, and it is similar to those we have mentioned in the division concerning the methods of care
If it is not dissolved in the water that we have mentioned, it is a strong cause of the disease, for which it is necessary to administer an extraction from it using an instrument called a siringua.  This is shaped as follows: either of silver or of bronze like a nail, with a hole like a nail at one end.
And the method for extracting the urine for this purpose is that you take the bladder doubled and bind it at the neck of the bladder or scrotum for good support; and insert the instrument into the opening of the bladder beyond the scrotum, and pierce with the forceps if any cause of the swelling persists, more deeply insert the needle with force.  And then increase the size of the bladder with a border and an albumin of oil.</end_of_turn>
And do the same to the patient on the side, and bandage the wound of the foot and the ankle with oil of olives and oil of almonds.</end_of_turn>
Then insert the instrument easily until it reaches the root of the bone; and bend the bone downwards at the part of the embolism; and hold the instrument firmly in place; and hold the embolism firmly in place until it reaches the bladder, and that the disease is overcome, for this is not useful according to this order, but in the meat in which there is pain.</end_of_turn
And gradually draw out the bladder with the swelling, so that the urine drains from the swelling.</end_of_turn>
Gradually extract it and do urine treatment, and use the instrument, do not cease until the bladder is evacuated and the disease is relieved.</end_of_turn
The end.
Of what quality of clamping of the bladder and the like instruments shall be agreed according to the water.</end_of_turn>
When there is an ulcer or swelling in the bladder, or it is congested with gravel, or is coarsened by pollution, and you wish to drain water and medicines, then it is necessary to use a clamp, which is as follows:
But if in the extraction of the bladder it is deaf, so it is closed.</end_of_turn And there are three incisions: two from one side, thus twice.</end_of_turn
At the beginning is the heel, in which is the water that is covered, and as much as it covers that, so much is added, until when any cause is taken away from that which is in the bladder, it is driven out, and when it is expelled, with water it is driven out, and when it is expelled long, according to how much the clamp holds that which is placed on the navel in the sea battles.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you wish to expel humidity from the bladder, insert the extremity of the clamp into the humidity, and pull out that water which is covered on the sides, for the humidity is expelled from the concavity of the clamp.</end_of_turn
And then insert the extremity of the clamp into the ankle according to what we have recommended in the instrument; and hold the humidity with water, for that humidity goes to the bladder at once, and the disease is overcome by that.</end_of_turn
Shape of the subtle crystallization of the bladder, which is as follows:</start_turn
And it is useful of silver or of bronze, of which the head of the needle resembles a small pen, and leave it with a loop of ligament.</start_turn
And then take the bladder in motion, and stop in that place the humidity that you wish to crystallize in the bladder, and then bind that between two with strong ligature of doubled thread, and scald that humidity over the fire.</start_turn
And then insert the extremity of the crystallization into the ankle.</start_turn
And then stretch your hand over the bladder with the humidity with a descending structure until the disease sees that that humidity has already reached the bladder.</start_turn
And if it does not appear to you that there is a bladder, then take a piece of barley and make a circle of that; and pierce that throughout its roundness; and then insert a strong thread firmly into those holes, even though they are revolting; and then increase the circle as much as it is increased by the saffron, because you stop in that water which you take away from the humidity, and oil and water.</start_turn
And then bind that in the instrument and do as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.</start_turn

De extraccio de peyra.
We have already mentioned in the division the varieties of stones and their care with medicines, and the difference between stones engendered in the kidneys and those engendered in the bladder, and their signs.
And we have mentioned the stone in which cathes operation is with my hand, and incision
And the stone engendered in the bladder itself is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And thus I have mentioned the exposure and summary of the matter
Therefore I say that the stone most commonly seen in children; and its signs are that the urine expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its transparency, and appears in that sand; and it causes frequent pain, soft stools, and vomiting; and is often treated with purgatives
And it is strange that the healing of children of that age does not usually take place until they have reached thirteen years; and it is difficult to cure them in old age Perhaps in the young it is easier because it is between those things.
And of that from which the stone is larger and the care is lighter; and if it is little, it is contrary to that
Therefore when we arrive at the treatment of that, cover at the beginning the one who cries out, since he extracts from them all the wound which is in their buttocks; for that wound several soft stools prevents the infection of the stone from the inquiry of it.
And thus be present the pain in the buttocks and account for it and hold your hand over their legs so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it comes out by itself with some soft stools.
And thus do that which is between your hands prepared, and the greater part of them shall be left with the cushions of their thighs, so that the whole bladder may be made to fall down to the lower parts
And thus request that and all that is required be done.
Therefore if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately you should make an incision over it
And if you do not immediately take hold of it, then cover that you touch with oil the area that is said of the left hand, if the pain is in a child, or say half if it is in an adult male, and enter that into the buttock hole And request the stone to be taken out when it is left there And convert that little by little into the mouth of the bladder
And thus press upon that which is said of the hand, and expel that to the outside of the body where you made the incision
Command the minister to hold the bladder with his hand; and command another minister to extend with his right hand the thighs to the outside, and with his left hand support the buttock which is left by the thighs, in part of the place where the incision was made
And thus we have come to the end of the matter of which this is the form. And the incision is made between the buttock and the thighs, not in the middle part, along the side of the left cushion; and the incision is made over that stone and the hand is said to be either on the buttock or above it, and a transverse incision is made so that the incision on the outside is wide enough and the exit of the stone is as possible, and not greater, than that which would compress the hand that is in the buttock at the time when the stone is being taken out, and is pushed out with feces.
And you must know that of the stone there is any that has angles and margins, for that its extraction is difficult because of that.
And of that one which is like a lion is similar to marrow, and is round, and is easy to extract from it because of its lightness
Therefore if it is that one which has angles and margins, adjust in the fissure
And if it is not thus pushed out, then cover that you place over that, or that you press upon that with your hand conveniently, the limb that is like a lime which you press upon the stone, and do not avoid it; or that you enter immediately with your instrument to curve the limb.
Or if you cannot overcome that, then amplify the wound a little, and if you see a flow of urine, cut through that with that strong vitriol which is crushed
If the stone is bigger than one, at the beginning of the treatment you place your hand at the opening of the bladder, and then you puncture it; and then you insert a little bit of something; and in the same way if there are two stones.
And if the stone is big, it is known that you should not puncture that big section, because that can cause two evils: either that it remains there or that it causes continuous discharge of urine, for which the area is not completely solidified.</end_of_turn>
Better give it an outward expulsion than leave it fractured, or make an incision with the forceps until you extract that which is in pieces.</end_of_turn>
Therefore when you have finished your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood, and strengthen that.</end_of_turn And rest upon that wound covered in oil and vinegar, or in oiled wool and warm water, so that the burn becomes softened.</end_of_turn
Then keep the patient lying down on the bed, and do not take away the dressing until the third day.</end_of_turn>
When he takes it away, soak the area with water and a little oil, and then care for it with diaphoretics and diuretics until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If in the wound there remains a burn, adhere and soften it, and from that it appears as if the bladder is frozen, and for that the urine is prohibited (and that is known as the evacuation of the bladder with urine), therefore evacuate the stone from the wound and extract that stone, for if it remains it can cause the bladder to burst and decay.</end_of_turn
And finally wash the wound with wine, water and salt, and against all spices, with that which agrees with the cure until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And in all the hours of treatment lie both thighs together and adjust the medicines that were placed on the area.</end_of_turn
And if the stone is small and is in the meat of the bladder, and it is fixed there, and there is a retention of urine, it is known that treatment should be recommended that it should be extracted, because that which is recommended for this treatment is considered to be an extraction; and already I have said that it is necessary to extract it, for if you do not extract it, it is known that you will cause a perforation of the bladder.</end_of_turn
of triangular shape, pointed, fixed in flesh.</end_of_turn>
And take hold firmly, and hold that bladder so that the stone does not return to the bladder.</end_of_turn
And finally evacuate the iron from the bladder, perforating easily until the perforator reaches that stone.</end_of_turn And turn the perforator in your hand over that small stone, and you will perforate the bladder until you have made a hole through which the urine can flow freely.</end>
And finally put your hand over what remains of the stone from the part where the perforation was made, because that is bruised and is bled by the urine, and the patient is healed.</end
And if this treatment does not seem appropriate for any cause that you know of, then lie a thread to leave the stone, and another thread to pull the stone out.</end And do it over the stone in that bladder between two threads.</end> And finally extract that.</end And then remove the thread and bind the wound with congealed blood, which is useful for the wound.</end
And it is not necessary to leave the thread to keep the stone from returning to the bladder, but to pull the other thread, for when it is removed the thread that was left near the evacuation of the stone returns to its place and closes the wound.</end
And for this reason when you remove the thread, raise the area above the wound, or that it returns to its place, and close the wound as we have said.</end>
The end.

And if you see a stone in any of them, it is known that the treatment is difficult, and is prohibited by violent methods.</end
The one of them is that the strong woman is a virgin.
And the second is that you will not find a woman who is truly wise who will desist from scolding the doctor when she is chaste, or who is one of the women who has a husband.
The third is that you will not find a woman who is truly learned in this art, mostly the operation with the hand
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on the foot in women is far from the location of the stone, because it causes an excessive incision, and in that there is fear.
May be if it is necessary you cause her to drink, but the hour covers that you take a wise woman, and few are found who are learned.
May be if you are deprived of this, the hour approaches a a wise woman who is discreet, or presents a matron who is esteemed among women, or a woman who in this art has often been successful
Therefore make her present and command her to do whatever you order, from the inquiry about the stone to the beginning; for the cause is that she regards whether the woman is a virgin, the hour covers that she puts all this into practice in her belly and wants the stone
Therefore if you find her, keep her still and command her to lie down.
May be if she is not a virgin, the hour commands the matron to insert what is said into the belly of the patient and to grasp the stone, since she puts her left hand over the bladder, and compresses that well.
Therefore if you find her, the hour covers that gradually move her from the orifice of the bladder to the parts below until she reaches that which is at the root of the disease.
And immediately insert about that application of the thumb on the belly of the patient the root of the disease which is in any part of it, and keep the stone in that place, and do not touch the stone with your hand together with her.
And the incision is to be made cautiously at the beginning; and immediately insert the hook over that incision, and if you feel the stone, the hour adjusts the incision according to the quantity which you know the stone will be evacuated from that
And you know that the species of stones are many: that some are small and great, and yellow and rough, and long and round, and have no ramp.
Therefore you must know what species they are of these for what you signify about what you want.</start_of_turn>
And if you see a flow of urine, adjust at the old wound three fingers and hold her for an hour until the urine is gone, and then return to your operation until the stone is evacuated.
And make ready all your instruments which are said in the extraction of stones in women, so that you are helped in your operation by them
And if you see a flow of urine, and you know that the expulsion of the urine is from the bladder that is unclosed, the hour you stop powder over the place and open that which is powdered and stricture descending, and do not do anything; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for that will cause the patient to die And take care of the wound.
Therefore when the urgency of the urine has passed a few days, and the wound has healed, the hour you return to your operation until the stone is evacuated

Of incision for hernia of the belly
Hernia which is watery is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which is left the codpiece containing the bowels, and is called a sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper channel which nature has prepared in the belly which has already prepared another liquid; and it is the codpiece of the genetius between the white sac which we have said, and it is not water but urine
And the generation of this hernia is for excessive pressure which happens to the genetius, because at these there is poured out this matter, and sometimes it happens by a violent blow which is made upon the genetius
And this moisture has various colors, because the color of it is declining to yellow or bloody, or orange, or black feculent, or white liquid, and that is more
And the signs by which one knows that this accumulation of liquid is in the white sac which we have said, is that when it is removed it is redone declining a little in length thus as if it were a figure of water, and appears the genetius, for that the moisture contains all that is in it from all sides
If the humidity is in the proper panicle, then it is believed that the cause is another humus.
If the humidity is between the crease of the thighs and the white stripe, then it is a gout
And when you wish to recognize the color of the humidity, then you will see the color of the humidity in the apostema as it descends from the form that precedes it; and according as that which is seen in the remnants of the form, judge of that which is contained in it.</start_of_turn>
Therefore when we come to the care of them [patients], we command the patient to be flexible if it is possible, and sometimes we must force them.</start_of_turn
And thus rest upon the seat two upon any cause a little higher, and stop their movements with a drape.</start_of_turn>
And thus sit you on the left side of them, and command the minister to follow the right side of them, who will extend his arm from two palms to the crease of the thighs and to the part under the belly.</start_of_turn
And thus take hold of the heel and split the crease of the thighs from the middle of the foot to the length within the palm of the hand.</start_of_turn
And the section should be made according to the rule at an equal distance from the line that should divide the skin of the thighs, until it reaches the white stripe encompassing.</start_of_turn
And scrape away that one, and observe, and keep yourself so that you do not burn that one; and your scraping with which you scrape that one apart should be suspended in the middle of the liquid and clearly written on the scraping according to the quantity that you can.
And thus pierce the white belly with a wide perforation, and extract all the liquid.</start_of_turn
And thus separate between two the edges of the section with nails, and stretch the belly to the parts below; and do not touch the crease of the thighs encompassing, and prick the belly in that manner that is to you possible.</start_of_turn And prick that one in its entirety or in pieces, and more particularly the inner ankle, because if you do not carefully observe the prick of them, it is not safe that the liquid does not return.</start_of_turn
More if the liquid proceeds from that area of the thigh in the hour of your operation, when you have completed the incision of the belly, return that one back in its place, and then adjust the two edges of the crease of the thighs with sutures, and care for that one as for the others.
And if you find the liquid corrupted by another disease, then command that you ligate the vessels which are sore the suppliers, and extract the liquid, and care for that one as we have said.</start_of_turn
More if the liquid is added in two equal parts, then know that two are hernias; therefore prick that part as you did the other equally; and if you think that it is an operation, then do it.</start_of_turn
And thus take away the holy oil, and enter into the incisions soaked in oil or in scented oil; and stop there another cloth which you have soaked in wine and oil, and expand that over two thighs and the belly; and stop over that cloth doubled and fine powder, and tie those over with a bandage in the manner mentioned above:
And thus take two cloths and fill them with coarse linen according to that shape; and fasten the extremities with which it is customary to fold coto or linen, and join them with a bandage at the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities to the two toes inside the two, and the second to the part of the buttock, and two extremities over two ankles and two others over two knees, and all the bandages should be adjusted in the groin of the thighs.</start_of_turn>
And many times this hernia is medicated artificially with a cautery in place of an incision with a knife; and it is that you take a pointed cautery subtle and that you prick that on the crease of the thighs, and it is ignited as we have recommended until the white belly containing the liquid is discovered, and when you have taken the cautery in that manner.</start_of_turn and it is closed in Greek characters.</start_of_turn
And thus pierce that belly, and it is ignited until all the liquid is out.</start_of_turn
And thus stretch the belly with nails, and scrape with nails, and scrape with pointed cautery ignited; and prick that one as you can until you have drained all of it; and keep yourself away from the heat that the fire does not touch.</start_of_turn
You are right, the sentence means:
Maybe if you do the opposite of cautery at the time of amputation or at the time of cutting, or of flux of blood, the hour covers that you take care of what makes you sick in this way, with the care that you are accustomed to giving them according to what is said.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if the patient is poor and does not expect the second operation because of its horror, the hour recommends perforation according to what I recommend; and it is when you are confirmed that you must do so, for which reason we have said of the significances, that that hernia is harmless.</end_of_turn>
The hour covers that you must leave the patient lying over any raised cell, and then perforate the apostema in the lower part of it as much as possible, and pause the perforation according to the length of the body.</end_of_turn
And let the opening be wide enough to drain out all the water.</end_of_turn>
And then place your hand over the area under the knee and hold the other hand and leave the other hand free, so that the water remains inside.</end_of_turn And then care for the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Maybe if there is resistance to the outflow of water at that hour you perforate that: and that is not useful except for when the white puss in the wound makes resistance and hinders the outflow of the water, the hour covers that you must put an ointment on the wound or an instrument with which the water is extracted from the vesicles, the form of which precedes; or adjust in the oppression of the wound a small piece of sponge.</end_of_turn
You know that the water returns, and is renewed every six months or in February; and when it is renewed, the hour recommends that it be perforated according to that method, because the patient will spend the next few days like this.</end_of_turn
Chapter 163.</end_of_turn>
Of amputation concerning carnosa hernia and its treatment.</end_of_turn>
You know that in the amputation of this hernia there is a fear of losing sensation in the major limbs; for I have seen the dismissal of them and their being saved for that better.</end_of_turn
And I remember the operation in which and the species of the apostemas.</end_of_turn
Therefore, I say that the apostemas are born in the bones of which the genetia is composed and that it is useful for various causes: or for sudden excessive fat, which is spread on the genetia, or for percussion.</end_of_turn
And it is the color of the apostema according to the color of the bone, and it is not found in pain, and it is hard apostema.</end_of_turn
And strong is the apostema scraped, of which the color is dark, and it is not soft to the touch.</end_of_turn
And various causes are useful for the nodulation of the arteries, and for the inflammation of those as well as for the perception of them, or for the inflammation of veins.</end_of_turn
Maybe that which is for the inflammation of the arteries is known for the spreading of the apostema when you press that around those said thighs; and it does not touch that.</end_of_turn
Maybe that which is useful for the inflammation of veins is not dispersed by any cause due to the compression around those.</end_of_turn
And it is already possible that concerning this species it is useful to perform an amputation and concerning the others meats; and that you mark the genetia code, and then stretch the flesh to the lower parts, and extract that from the white pith, and release the blood vessels, and ligate them, and insert the blood supply more than you release from all the parts of the flesh.</end_of_turn
Therefore if the blood is already in those hardened meats, the hour covers that you extract the blood and insert that.</end_of_turn
And if there is adherence between any cause of the pith, or between those that are between the veins, the hour covers that you remove all that adherence and insert that by incision round.</end_of_turn
Maybe if there is born from meat at the place of the adherence which is behind, the hour covers that you insert all that is of it, and extract the blood as we have said.</end_of_turn
Therefore when your operation is completed, the hour fills the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and wine; and then take care of that as with the other care.</end_of_turn

Vital is a swelling covered by any covering similar to a sprout with a softening of the testicles, and it is painful to exercise and walk on the patient.
And in the care of this disease is fear of what precedes memory.
However we must say that the operation must be done as soon as possible.
And I say that you must make the patient lie on a raised cushion; and support the testicles to the lower parts; and take hold of the groin with the thumbs against the ribs; and have the others serve who you wish and extend those with violent extension.
And then make an incision with a sharp knife at the great toe for a transversal incision until the veins are discovered.
And then extract all parts as we have said in the extraction of intestines which are in the temples.
And then leave in that place a double needle, and tie one at the front of the place where the vital occurred, and tie the other at the back of them. And then make an incision in the middle of the limb for a transverse incision according to the length of the limb, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors
And then care for the wound with the care of the other wounds in which you wish to make it so that the veins which would otherwise be jeopardized by two testicles do not suffer damage.
Even if the veins were to be damaged by the vital, it is necessary that the testicles be extracted or that they be broken up with the veins, because they are devoid of all nourishment for the vessel, and that they be established, or that they be crushed so that they are not harmful to those.

Of the care of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is for incision that extends over the abdomen from the flanks to the navel, because when the intestines are ruptured from that break, they are thrown among the intestines.
And this rupture is either from the spleen or from excessive pressure, and it occurs from various causes: either percussion, or cough, or strain, or elevation of some serious cause, or from any other similar thing.
The sign of this, when it is for extension of the spleen, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and is a swelling within the abdomen which makes the spleen compress the intestine
And the sign of this is when it is for incision of the spleen, that it causes sudden severe pain at the beginning; and it is a swelling different from that of the preceding, which is due to the displacement of the intestine from the position it occupies in the abdomen.
And many physicians neglect the gut membrane in the belly, and call this an intestinal hernia.
And some physicians are harmful with the wind, and some physicians run in the belly wound, and here it is retained, and it is in this way that it brings great discomfort to the patient, and some physicians cause great pain when they press
And in the care of these complications of this disease there is fear, for that we must avoid the remedy in that case.
The way of performing the operation of that is that we command the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the lower parts of his concavity if he obeys our order, and we put a bandage over his belly between his legs, and elevate the legs.
And then we grasp the cord that we see joining the testicles to the lower parts, and we make an incision throughout the length; and we leave two ligatures at the ends of the incision as we indicate to open the incision with those.
And if the incision is as much as you are able to do, that from that there is no more cause for regret.
And then we extract that thick blood that is left from the cord of the testicles, until the white tough membrane of some part is discovered
Then you shall see the gut said to be between the white, which is left from the cord of the testicles, and the white of the belly, which is left from the cord of the blood, and the intestines adhere to that which is behind the belly
And now I grasp the testicles with my right hand, and with my left hand I spread out the white cloth upon it, and I elevate the blood towards the section; and I command the minister to extend the blood vessels and you will dissolve the adhesion that is behind the solution completed.
And indeed, concerning the thighs, I say that there is no cause for the swelling covered by the white cloth there Perhaps if you discover the cause of it, then you can remove it from the belly itself
And pierce in the part behind the testicles for the section which runs from here to there as we have recommended previously
And administer immersed lanolin in oil, and place in the wound; and administer the ligature which we have recommended (for several ligatures the white cloth is cauterized, which we have said above in relation to the fear of the flow of blood, because several ligatures happen to occur there).
If the case is delayed, let cold water be poured, and place over that until it falls as we have said above.
And take care of the wound with the other care of wounds until it is healed

Of venous hernia.
In this hernia nothing has been observed that is different from its care in general
And first say that it is useful just as we have recommended in the hernia that is in the leg; which is that you bind the blood vessels near the section above which facilitates them; and dry in the middle area around the swelling to prevent it from coming out until the blood vessels have fallen down
And take care of the wound as we have said until it is healed
Chapter 67.</start_of_turn
Of the disruption which is useful in the armpits
Some veins must be broken in the armpits as we have said above, and examine the area
And do not let the genealogist have any cause for swelling at the genealogist; and if there is any, it is little; and return immediately in all hours
And if it is prolonged, a suture is adjusted in the white cloth so that the swelling subsides in the white cloth; and this happens because of the extension of the white cloth which is in the armpits as we have said above, which causes the white cloth to be stretched, and therefore it is softened and the area is relaxed and examined
And the care of it is like that which precedes it
And many times it is cured with iron according to this method: that the patient grasps two fingers of the hands between his thighs, and then dries the area of the rupture of the abscesses examined at the section for the width according to the quantity of three fingers.
And tighten the white cloth which is under the testicles until it is discovered
And take the sponge and place it over the prominent part of the white cloth, and press that against the belly.
And bind the two prominent areas on the edge of the sponge of the white cloth, and tie one of them to the other with the suture
And draw out the edge of the sponge, and do not puncture the white cloth at all, neither extend the blood, nor any other cause as I will tell you in the care of intestinal hernia
And thus care for that which is causing the plague, and when inflammation subsides, restore that which has been inflamed until it is consolidated; for otherwise it is contracted and the swelling is not adjusted to the fracture.
It is better in this place, for it is more likely to be saved.
Chapter 68.
On the treatment of the swelling of the testicles.
The testicles that have been swollen with swelling in the scrotum become softened by doing so that the parts that are between them are also softened, and it is sufficient for them to be regarded as healed
When necessary is that which is requested in the care of them that makes the patient lie down for two days, and cut off all the swelling that has been softened over the natural swelling; and thus adjust two lips with the suture
And if you will, in the beginning soften the swelling of the testicles with three incisions or four and with a firm suture
Then insert between the sutures; and thus care for the healing of the other wounds until it is healed and the inflammation subsides
Chapter 69
On castration
Wisdom dictates that castration is prohibited by our law, however, I recall it from this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two cases. The first is that the physician should know how to cure it when questioned about it. The second is that we must often castrate other animals for our young people for those, thus as dogs, and sows, and pigs, and like other animals.
And therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: either by traction or by incision to the root
However, in that way in which it is useful by traction, the way of the work is that we must cut off the animal in cold water until the testicles are softened and limp and pend And thus take hold of them with your hand until they are resolved and no longer appear to be touching
However, in castration useful for incision and section, that you must hold the animal and grasp the testicles of the animal with your left hand
And thus tie the ligature, and insert about every hour with a section until two hours have passed
And thus insert those which remain that appear to have been scorched And do not worry about those of the contracted kind, but about those which are on the veins.
And this way of castration is better than that of traction, because traction causes any cause of the testicles so that the beast desires to bite
And thus care for the wound until it is healed

On the treatment of hermaphroditism
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two ways: the one is when there is space between the testicles in the groin where there appears a female organ in which there are testicles.
And some say that it is due to the urine which is in the groin of the testicles
And in women it is a kind: and it is that which has the female organ on the fifth pair of ribs as well as two testicles of a man somewhat small and close together as well as the penis of a man and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three kinds: two of the men and one of the women And it is that you must remove those parts adjusted until it removes the mark of that, and thus care for those with the care of the other wounds
And in the second kind of men in which urine is in the groin of the testicles, there is neither treatment nor operation for them

On the swelling and the elevation of the body for the causes of women
A strong swelling is adjusted for natural causes until it is relaxed and is useful to her with regard; and some say that it is swollen in many women as much as in men and even during coitus

And take care of the wound until it has healed.</end_of_turn>
More pain is born of fear than from the great danger itself, and it is often called “malady caused by fear” when it first appears; therefore know that we must inscribe with sufficient length of thread as with the wound itself, and take care of the wound until it has healed.</end_of_turn>
(The text continues with a numerical reference to the end of the treatise.)
On the care of wounds.
A wound is considered to be an opening of the female organs that has not perforated the skin, or an opening of little size.</end_of_turn It may be either natural or accidental.</end_of_turn
Accidental is that caused by an illness that preceded it, or that is caused by a wound or by something not adjusted correctly, or by an unusual or excessive secretion.</end_of_turn
It is caused in the groin, on the edge of the wound, on the sides of the body, on the buttocks or on the genitals, and it prevents sweating, movement and coition, and it often prevents menstruation.</end_of_turn
And the knowledge of that is useful for the preservation of the womb, if the infection is apparent, it is dangerous; however, if it is not apparent, then you must be certain that it is in the bowels or in the flesh itself.</end_of_turn
However, if the infection is due to an excessive secretion, and is confined to the two lips, then you must cut it off and remove it.</end_of_turn
And put your hand over the two lips and indicate with your voice that there is pus inside.</end_of_turn
And the woman should be over the two hips, the thighs should be wide apart, and then extend the two lips with force until that excessive secretion is broken and the infection is opened.</end_of_turn
Then take a cloth and soak it in oil and place it over the area, and hold it there for a while so that the wound does not harden.</end_of_turn>
However, if the secretion is thick and viscous, then know that you must inscribe with some sponge or lint or with a piece of myrtle.</end_of_turn
If the infection is for cartilage, then suspend that with your thumb, and then inscribe it.</end_of_turn
And let the medicines be given that stop the flow of blood, such as vinegar, alum and saffron, adjusted with oil of alum.</end_of_turn
And give a wide needle of lead so that the wound is not permanently hardened.</end_of_turn
And keep it for a while and apply cold salve.</end_of_turn>
And take care of it with the other care of consolidation until it has healed.</end_of_turn
And many times an accident in the groin does not result in the formation of other wounds, and therefore know that you must inscribe according to this manner.</end> However, if there is soft swelling in the groin, which is not caused by a wound in any way.</end_of_turn
(The treatise continues with a numerical reference to the end.)
On the care of haemorrhoids, fistula and red swelling that occur in the groin.)</end_of_turn
Haemorrhoids are considered to be prolapse of veins through the orifices of the veins rather than from those that carry continuous blood flow; and when they are ancient, they become fistula.</end_of_turn
And I have already said in the division of these species of haemorrhoids and their signs, and I say that those that receive treatment and those that do not receive treatment.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that haemorrhoids and fistula that are in the groin and do not appear to the feeling, it is not necessary to treat them with iron.</end_of_turn
However, those that are in the orifice of the groin about which there is sensation, are to be treated.</end_of_turn
The woman should be placed in a warm bath, and then stretch out her toes towards her toes, or towards rough stones, and prick those towards the roots.
And then powder should be sprinkled over those parts from which the humors flow of one of the incisions, thus as to cause a scab and be similar to those.
And then soak the feet for an hour, and then rest in cold water.
And if the flow of the humor persists, then make decoction of poppy seeds and of scabrous scales of millet and of gum and of something similar.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar and make plaster with it over two of them.
And if the humor is evacuated, well; otherwise, adhere to two winds, and to the breasts make an incision
And then take oil and immerse that in juice of rue or in juice of elderberry or in juice of ivy with vinegar and make adhere to the place; and take care of the place until it is healed.
And take care of that until it is healed.

Of puncture of the eye in the major.
Many species of boils arise accidentally in the major, thus as cancer and boil lapident and ulcerate and erode and form abscesses and fistulas hemorrhoidal and ulcerous and yellow and other boils. And I have already said these diseases and their species and their signs and their treatment in the division.
And I say in this treatise of boils that come to the light when they are of the boils that accompany health, and if you wish to know in what manner this operation is performed on them
Therefore, consider if the pain of the boil in the heel begins acutely with percussion and flexion and fever, and sometimes when it embraces and if you touch it, the hour does not suffice for its perforation, and take care of that which helps about the maturity until the acute of the accidents cease.
And the hour comes that you must cease the woman over a cushion which has two cushions; recline on the heel two and adjust the feet of the patient to the part beyond the belly, and the thighs are spread out, and rest the thighs above the navel, and tie whatever is convenient to it
And then the midwife follows behind the stretcher and administer the instrument with which the opening of the major is made, the form of which will come in those cases that make it necessary.
Therefore, when you are going to administer this instrument, stay close to the edge of the major of the woman, and what comes out of the instrument from the major must not be more than the edge of the major and cause her pain If the instrument is larger than the edge of the major, nevertheless, take care that you sprinkle powder over the texture of the edge of the major so that the entrance of any instrument into the edge of the major is prohibited
And take care that you stop the vertigo that runs in the stretcher after it is detached and that the minister has the instrument and turns the vertigo until the opening of the major is made
And when the discharge comes out, which is touched with the hand and is lean and soft, the hour comes that you must remove that which must be covered with the palm of the hand
And when the health is evacuated, the hour comes that you must place on the wound a compress submerged in olive oil or green oil in which there is any stiffness; and rest the heel in the section in the edge of the major
And rest the major and over the wound clean wool soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.
And take care of it for two days until it is healed.
And many other things are washed the major and the wound thus as it is crystallized with water and honey, and then with water in which are boiled pieces of licorice or of longwort, and then return to the dressing
And if the wound is hardened in the major by a scab, the hour comes that you must abstain from its care with the iron, having taken care of that which has been said in the division
Capitol .lxxv.
The matron should be taught how to manage patients with unusual figures.
It is necessary for the matron to know in the beginning the figure of the normal fetus by its signs, and that when the woman screams out at the genitals and wishes to smell air, and because of that the belly swells up because of it, the doctors know that this part is not naturally formed, and that is why it is called hanging or pendulous from the navel.
Therefore when you see these signs, you should press the belly so that the embryo is slightly pressed downwards when it wants to rest on the navel, and this will prevent these excesses which are harmful to the mother.
May it be known that any part which is not natural and not useful, for when the embryo is ejected from its feet and the body from the head of the embryo to the feet, and the hand or the foot of the embryo is grasped, or the heel of the embryo, or the head and hand of the embryo, or the belly of the embryo, or the heel of the embryo is converted over the navel, and it resembles the figures which are not useful.
It is necessary for the matron to be wise and discreet in all these matters, and to avoid error and deception.
And I have shown you all the figures of these things, and what is their meaning so that you know what it is and why it is like that.
When the fetus is ejected from the navel naturally, and that is vehement on the woman, and that part is difficult for her, and sometimes the virtue of the woman is already weakened, then it is necessary to do what the women have to do, and to drive away the stench with some fragrant unguents and fragrant oils.
And immediately put the matron between the thighs and make a small incision on the second one, or cut off that which is within with its nail until you have removed all the moisture from it And press the belly of the woman until it is ejected.<end_turn>
May it be known that if it does not come out, you should cover the woman with mucus of peas and mucus of fennel with cotton wool.
And command her to lie down, to press, that it be compressed and that she should be made to vomit; and keep her mouth and nose closed for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled in that way.
And if two parts of the fetus have already been expelled at the beginning, then you should gradually reduce them.<end_turn> May it be known that if she does not obey the treatment, then you should place the woman on a cushion and lift her legs up, and put your hand under her; and the woman should be kept still so that she does not fall from the bed.
And if the most of them are not expelled, and the fetus dies, then you should make an incision and extract the fetus or tie the corpse to your hand and extract that as well, for that which is expelled will be forgotten
When the fetus comes out on the thighs, then you should grasp those with your hands and make the fetus small, and then pull that which is within and grasp one leg and extend the others little by little
And when you see that the space has opened between the patient's thighs, then command her to vomit and make her vomit continuously, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled from what we have recommended, then you should gradually return the fetus until you see the normal figure, for that which is expelled will be forgotten in the pride of the doctor.
And if it is forbidden to do everything we have recommended, then take high musellage and dissolved gum, and pierce all over the belly for good percussion, and drive away the stench from the woman's belly, the pus from the belly of the fetus And do that until you achieve tranquility, until the convulsions cease.
And when the feet of the fetus are softened, then you should give it an ointment of myrrh and pause that. And when an hour has passed since the ointment was applied, then you should make her lie down on a cushion, and make her vomit, and take away that, and press the lower part of the belly with your hand, for the fetus will be expelled in that way
Immediately the lateral foot hangs suspended with one of its muscles stretched out.</end_turn> So proceed with the reduction of the hand, even if you are unable to do so, then elevate the thigh and let her go forward.</end_turn
If she cannot go forward, then make her lie on the lip, and with your hands press her thighs violently, and give her nourishment, which you should recommend with mucilage.</end_turn
If it is urgent for her to bear weight, then make her lie on her side, and study the reduction of the hand, and gently stretch the foot according to its natural figure, and make her relax the thigh and command her to breathe normally.</end_turn
Immediately the foot over the heel expands its muscles and the sole of the foot is at two o'clock with respect to its major.</end_turn When the matron has the foot's hand and gently rolls it little by little, and this will facilitate it.</end_turn
When it is so and as much as it is equal, and when it has been oiled and greased with mucilage, then pause over the head of the limb where we have recommended oil and ointment.</end_turn
And command her to move her hand little by little, and when she feels well enough, make her lie on her side and command her to be inclined towards the flank, and command her to be compressed; and make her relax thus.</end_turn The fetus is prepared for exit upon the lateral side.</end_turn
When they order her to deliver the child violently in this manner, consider it, and then you can insert your finger into the opening between the membranes until the fetus is evacuated of the moisture.</end_turn
And if the foot is hanging suspended over the face and the heel, then insert your finger into the navel, so that it is not retained and remains.</end_turn
And gently pull up the foot to the joints until it is relaxed, and command the thigh to compress her somewhat, and the spirit will be out of her immediately, if God wills or no.</end_turn
The delivery of twins or many fetuses.</end_turn It is known that twin fetuses that are closely attached to each other are born together, and sometimes three or four are born, which is strange and often ends in death; however, such things are not for us to know, for they are caused by God.</end_turn
And so be it that even if they are multiplied, one by one, and are separated by the navel cord of each of them, distinguish those who are entire among the ligaments of the navel cord of each of them. And so many other things are born for us, just as a single fetus naturally turns with delight, and so many others are born for us, for we have recommended them.</end_turn
And if they are difficult for you to deliver, you must do so violently and as we have said of the unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have recommended.</end_turn
And if the midwife is skillful and makes what is necessary easier and more pleasant, and is opportune, and is skillful according to the whole figure as she has been prepared to do by the imminent danger to health.</end_turn
Remember that they are formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.</end_turn
Some veins are formed in the great majority one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and sometimes ten. And it has been verified that a woman has aborted six times, and another ten times altogether, which causes great pain for measurement among the learned doctors.
And all this I say that the midwife knows well that a strong woman has come to that part as if it were that, therefore do not oppose it as if covering it up.</start_of_turn>
Chapter LXV.</start_of_turn>
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.</start_of_turn
When you cure the dead fetus as we have said in the division of medicine and it does not go out by itself, then you must certainly use an operation with your hand. And in this case you must consider whether the woman is of sound virtue and is not at risk of miscarriage due to the accidents for which she is feared to be at risk of miscarriage.</start_of_turn
And you must cover the woman with a sheet over her thighs and her seat, and her head should be inclined towards her chest and her thighs should be elevated.</start_of_turn
And the minister must hold that part of her two parts or bind her in the sheet so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.</start_of_turn
And immediately moisten the mouth of the mother with oil of olive and mucus of aloe and of marigold and of poppyseed.
And immediately give the midwife your hand with those oils and mucilages, and immediately support her hand in the mother, and immediately place your hand on the part where the nails are in the fetus.</start_of_turn
And look conveniently where: when you consider that the fetus is ready to come out of the navel, and when you have left the nails in the heel, or in the heel bone, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or you leave the beard, or in the chest, or in the flanks, or in the proper places of the flanks, or you leave the navel cord.</start_of_turn
May it be that the delivery is on the feet of the woman, but in the fifth month, or in the middle of the flanks.</start_of_turn
And cover that you have the nail in your left hand, and stop the curvature of the limb in that place where it is between the thumb and the little finger, and support the hand so that the nail is in some of those places that we have mentioned until the cause of pain comes.</start_of_turn
And immediately stop and stay in the position of support of her another nail, or the third if necessary, so that it is an equal traction and not simply an extension according to its custom.</start_of_turn
And may it be that at all times it is enough for the delivery to be relieved as soon as possible, as it is done in the case of the extirpation of the fetus.</start_of_turn
And cover that between them that the extension should be softened; and if any part of her is retained, the midwife must immediately give the said oils to her and support those expectations and rotate those that are retained.</start_of_turn
Therefore if the part of the fetus is expelled, then immediately change the nails between the place where it is more convenient; and do this until all the fetus is expelled.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the hand is torn from the other, and it is not possible to reduce that due to the thickness of the limb, then cover that with a bandage around that; and extract that until all is expelled, and cut that or in the junction of the hand or in the wrist.</start_of_turn
And immediately cover both the other hand and the two feet.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the head of the fetus is large, or if it has been coarsened in the delivery, or if there is water adjusted in the head, then insert between the teeth some spines and open the head and extract the water, or that you break it with an instrument called “alundat”, the shape of which will be like the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that is related to this.</start_of_turn
And in the same way do if the fetus is of great head by nature: and the midwife must cut that with the clamp, or that she press that with the sponge just as we have said; and immediately extract the bones with forceps.</start_of_turn
And if the head is torn out and is clotted at the collarbone, the midwife must cut until the humidity that is in the feet is drained out.</start_of_turn
May it not be complicated, nor obey these things without reason, for in this case your incision will be as great as your wisdom allows.
If the belly is swollen or hydropsic, then you must perform the incision before the moisture escapes from it
When the foot is operated upon, the attraction of the limb is slight and the direction towards the major orifice is slight
If the coarseness has been prolonged, you must extract that which has been wrapped around your hand, and open the belly and the foot until the moisture has escaped from them.
When the other limbs are finished and the head is returned, the left hand should be introduced into the matrix; when the mouth of the matrix is open, introduce the hand into the vulva, and close the opening of the matrix, and draw the opening towards the mouth of the matrix, and at the same time introduce into it one or two nails, and draw them out towards those.
When the mouth of the matrix is closed by swelling, do not press too hard on it; it is necessary to administer an ointment of greasy humors. Administer plasters; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten
If the foot is operated upon on the side, if possible, do so with an awl: and let the water that we have mentioned in the foot be administered.
If this is not possible, the incision should be made in the heel, and the bone should be extracted
And you must not leave any cause of pain from the second time
When you have completed the entire operation, let the water that we have mentioned for the care of the swelling be administered
If there is a flow of urine, let it flow into sticky waters and administer the other treatment
And indeed I have seen a woman in the belly of whom there was death, and I put upon her another bandage pregnant, and the other death was the fetus. The swelling that is prolonged in the heel is of long duration; and when the fetus is opened up, the water begins to bubble up from the heel.
And I was called to care for her, and I treated her for a long time, but the plague was not overcome
Then I put on her some strong-attracting plasters, and I extracted one bone, and I left her for several days, and I extracted another bone; and I was amazed that there was no bone in the belly
And then I thought that these were the bones of the dead fetus
Therefore I removed the plague, and I extracted from her four bones, the woman exists in the thighs with a thousand milhosities, and I have seen in this way for a long time, without a mark from the plague
And I do not cease to be astonished, but rather that in this matter there is knowledge and an assistant with the hand for the care that is administered
About the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The way to make a vertical incision of the matrix:
This is the way of stretching in which the free parts are grasped, to which two incisions are made at the extremities of two thumbs The incision should be made so that it is less strict, and that it is made with a needle or an awl or of the thumb itself
And the width of each thumb is like two fingers, and the margin from each side is like a thumb, and the length is one palm and a half; and at the middle place of two thumbs there are two adjustments of that middle thumb which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width is like two fingers, or a little more
And these two adjustments are introduced into the mouth of the matrix so that it is opened by those two prescribed incisions
Another way similar to that, but more subtle and lighter:
Either a thumb or an awl or a needle according to the shape of forceps The patient's toes are two additional measures, and the length of these measures is equal to one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
When you wish to open the great toe, then do make a cut over the heel of the foot, open what is between the spaces of the toes.</end_of_turn> And open your hand with the instrument thus as when you wish to burn off the nails as much as the measure of the breadth of the opening of the toe will cause.</end_of_turn>
The way to do this which the ancients called...
A way of making that which is filled with fat...
A way of making that which contains the great head...
And it is assembled like tweezers to which teeth are put at the extremity, thus as sometimes, and some nails are made long thus as tweezers according to this form, thus as sometimes, to which teeth are put thus as teeth of a saw with which is incised and contains.</start_of_turn> A way of making that little.</start_of_turn
A way of uniting having a spine.</start_of_turn
A way of uniting having two spines.</start_of_turn
A way of making a spatula having two extremities to which the head is abounded.</start_of_turn
A way of making two spatulas wide.</start_of_turn
All these instruments are exercises, and when more they are multiplied the more skilled the artificer must be, the more curious about his operation and the more skillful the people must be for their quantity.</start_of_turn>
And do not work with these instruments either here or there, for their necessity is not excusable.</start_of_turn
Of the extraction of the second toe.</start_of_turn
When the second toe is retained you must embolden the patient that it is necessary to remove the nail, and then make her vomit with cordiality, and hold your hand over the mouth and the knees of the patient, and if by chance this should go out, do not be afraid.</start_of_turn
And if so, then take an ointment and pierce the cover with a needle and put it on that herb which will open the mouth of the toe, thus as camphor and wormwood and rue and chamomile and cassia lignea and rue marigold.</start_of_turn All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the ointment, and put that on the fire.</start_of_turn
And put a tube of gutta in the mouth of the toe, and hold that inside until the vapor comes out to the cavity of the toe.</start_of_turn
And do make her vomit thus as we have said, and the second toe will be extracted with speed.</start_of_turn
And if it remains close to this care and is not expelled, then command the matron to submerge your left hand in olive oil or in almond milk, and then interlace that in the hair and ask her to hold that over the second toe, and when she has found it, then take hold of it and extend it little by little since if it is attached to the heel of the foot, then interlace your hand as we have recommended, and when you have found the second toe, extract that little by little according to custom so that the foot does not suffer excessive traction.</start_of_turn And remember that it is necessary to change from right to left and from left to right with facility.</start_of_turn
And if the mouth of the toe is closed, as we have recommended the care with vomiting and with the ointment of the ointment with herbs.</start_of_turn
And if it is not expelled in all the ways that we have recommended, then keep in mind that when it comes out of the toe to the mouth of the toe it lies in the space of the heel, and then crystallize that with ointment and tetracycline; for that will make it disappear in a few days and will be expelled and gone.</start_of_turn
When the patient is poor, they emit a bad odor from the head and the stomach, which indicates the disease; and therefore it is necessary to administer antiphlegmatik remedies and appropriate treatments for it.
Indeed, the ancients often resorted to fumigation with naphtha and dry figs for such ailments
The way in which this instrument is used in which the woman is fumigated from behind is due to the retention of menses and the following discharge:
Either vinegar or wine should suffice
And let the sub-fumigation be applied over the thumbs and the wide limb over the fire, and the sub-fumigation be held over the sleeves of the fire.
And let that which enters be consumed by that sub-fumigation and repeat it again
Take care of the buttocks of the unperforated child
These children cry out and their buttocks are not perforated, which already suffer from the subtle and oppressive heat of the sun Therefore tell the matron to perforate at the said place; and if not, perforate at the spleen which is acute, and take care that it does not touch the liver.
Then place over that inflamed area in vinegar and oil; and take care of that which enters until it is settled
If you fear that it is oppressive, the hours pause in the groin for a few days, and leave it when the child will vomit
And indeed the oppression of the buttocks occurs for the consolidation of pus or of fistula; therefore let that consolidation be softened, and let it be cured with the things which we said concerning the treatment and the ointment
The treatment of fistulas that arise from behind
The fistulas that arise in the lower part of the buttocks are nodular and large, which arise from the buttocks or in the space between them
It is a fistula or swelling
When that nodule is old and putrefies with white or soft moisture, and there are several of these fistulas, some penetrate several times
And those that penetrate are recognized by the discharge of pus through the opening and the windpipe; and some physicians use the disease of discharge, and many others vomit it up from the belly
And there are some of these fistulas that penetrate into the bladder, and into the marrow of the heel; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the bone of the thigh
And it is known that a penetrating fistula that enters the buttocks and not penetrating, that you must tell them that it is at the buttocks and that you must attempt to evacuate pus or feces from the fistula when it is soft.
If there is still swelling, enter there with an attempt to apply ointment or poultice until you sit on the attempt or put it in the place it was said
If you do not sit on it nor does any cause of vomiting or diarrhea arise from the groin, as we have said, the hours remain that it is not penetrating, and the hours leave you to the treatment.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the marrow of the heel, the hours mean that it is urine from that fistula and prohibition of its use until the area is consolidated by the physician
When it penetrates the hip joint or the bone and causes pain in the limb, the hours signify that the attempt has entered here if not by swelling in the bone, and pain in the limb of the party; and that it has become soft; and that in this case it is not useful for the medicine, neither is it consolidated with the ointment
In all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure for all, and the cure for these is the work and the care of the physicians concerning which they are ordered to refrain
But in that which is not penetrating and not antiquated, salvation with iron is expected as I shall tell you when I give you the advice, and what I have already done and tried
And that the disease persists between your thighs and you elevate the legs into your chest, the thighs are inclined towards the belly of your body, and you enter with an attempt of ointment, or of feces if it is in the fistula swelling, until you see that the attempt has entered there
If the disease surrounds the buttocks, the hour tells you that you must tell them that it is at the buttocks
If you sit on the testicles, then the one you already sit on will naturally uncover and penetrate; and the one that you sit between will certainly penetrate; therefore do not work on that, for it is not in that place, just as we have said.
But I say indeed that in some people it is safe in some people
And as for the medicine by which it is hoped to help in this matter, it is that you burn the cautery superficially according to the size of the fistula, as it is said above, and introduce that flame into the fistula until it reaches around the circumference; and then repeat that two or three times until you are certain that all those tissues that seemed like feathers in the fistula have been burned off.</end_of_turn>
And so care for those clothes that are wrapped around the border until they are all burned; and care for those medicines that generate and consolidate the flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; otherwise, it is not healed at any time by another treatment.</end_of_turn>
If the testicles enter, and do not penetrate into the testicles which are in the buttocks, and between that and the testicles which is visibly made of flesh or cartilage, and sometimes the fistula comes out onto the surface of the coccyx, then dry the coccyx from the start of the fistula, and you will see that it is dry both inside and outside.
And so restore those tissues that were fistulaed, which are like feathers of geese, and do not remain from any cause.</end_of_turn>
But if there is an influx of pus sometimes between you and your operation when you burn those tissues, then it is better that you burn with fire or acute medicine, because the cautery with fire adjusts well those two bites of habitance: so is the closing of those tissues that were fistulaed, and the excision of the pus excess of humidity.</end_of_turn
And so care for those clothes that are wrapped around the border or in causes of distress until the limb gets well, and take care that the wound does not become inflamed with a hard flesh that generates and consolidates.
And so medicines that are astringent and excision; when it is restored it is already healed and you do not fear repetition.</end_of_turn>
But if the fistula has already entered into the pelvis of the buttocks and is elongated from its surface of the body, then enter the testicles into the buttocks and inquire about that.</end_of_turn>
And therefore if you seize the testicles and between you and it is visibly made of cartilage or flesh, and it is probable that it will penetrate, then it is not an operation in them but according to the way of trust and hope.</end_of_turn
Which cause is to administer in them in three ways: either that you burn that as we have said; or that you drain that until you achieve the concavity of them so that you can easily enter the some and the treatment will be more effective; and do not proceed without first draining the wound so that you do not insert the moisture containing the parts into the wound, and that you take care of the patient immediately for the benefit of the existence; or that you lengthen that very much and say that pus which you drained from that within the buttocks, as we have said, or with another acute instrument of extremity, and that you restore those tissues that were fistulaed in the incision as much as is possible; and that you make an effort to restore the whole wound from the incision, and if the inflammation of the pus does not consolidate, and the fistula remains open in the buttocks, and if there is still pus in the wound, then there is still pus in the wound. And sometimes the fistula is finished according to this manner: when you enter the testicles into the fistula, and it is in the buttocks around the surface of the body with the coccyx and on the margin of the buttocks, the testicles attempt to perforate the extremity, that is to say as if they were needles preparing the layers according to this form:
and you enter into that bundle of fat or around those; and then enter the testicles with the needle into the fistula until you achieve the concavity of them.</end_of_turn
But if it is penetrating in the margin of the buttocks do not worry, for you will extract the thread from that wound as soon as you enter the testicles into the buttocks; and you will extract the extremity of the thread and adjust the two extremities even, and bandage each, and leave it like that for a day or two, and when it has subsided a little bit reinsert the thread into the flesh; and when those tissues have subsided between the two extremities of the thread and that they are contained.
And so care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed.</end_of_turn>
But if the inflammation of the fistula is not penetrating, then you must make it penetrate in whatever way you are prepared, but not in the pelvis, for it is not your business to do that which might damage the moisture; and take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
The form of the spur is thorny in that in which the fistula is found: the curvature of which is neither acute nor obtuse, so that nothing is instilled that is not necessary, even as sometimes.
Sutures of wounds in which blood runs freely at the incision site.
There are two kinds of wounds: those that are closed by cartilage, or those that are like grass seeds And these are small and large, and that blood runs from all of them at once, and it is one, and not many, and is outside the buttock, and in the extremities of the limb.
But indeed those that are outside the buttock are according to the months of little humidity, of which there runs citrine urine or a little of blood with continuous color, and according to the color of the wound
And the treatment for that which is inside the buttock is that the patient should sit down and express himself until the wound is healed and the wounds appear again. Then you sit down and suspend yourself with hooks or that you have with your nails, and then apply those to the roots of the wound
But if your nails do not hold in those for the humidity of them and their softening, when you take them out they are rough or cut or softened by fat, extract them from the gut and apply them to the wound, and sprinkle over them some fine ashes or powder near the incision, so that they adhere to them instead of cutting; or cauterize them as it is foreseen in the chapter on cautery. And do the same treatment with the other wound until it is healed
And if the buttock does not obey evacuation, then order the patient to bite their tongue gently in the place where there is little biting, and to wash it with that liquid which is in the wound and which obeys evacuation willingly when the patient expels it.
But if the wounds are outside the buttock, the cause of them is slight, and it is that you grasp those with your nails, or that you grasp them with tweezers, and insert them, and do the same treatment with them as with those that are inside until they are healed
And whoever has the wound, cover that you administer sutures to him according to this manner: take a piece of thread and put it on a needle and then extract the wounds from the parts above, and make that penetrate through the root of the other part, and encircle the two extremities of the thread in the part beyond the needle, and so stretch the wound strongly, and then tie the thread and extract the needle.
And do all this, and leave them one and do not close them, so that the excess of blood runs from that
And put a cloth soaked in olive oil or in cerate over the buttock; and put that over the wound and command the patient to rest. And leave that until the box is ready; and when it is ready, care for them with embrocation or with another treatment until they are healed
And as these are ancient and are not useful in this medicine, when these happen you must grasp those with the point of the spur or with your nail until they are wet and be host to the pus which comes out, which hinders their consolidation; and do the same treatment until they are consolidated
Then you must hold those with greater force than at first until the wound is healed and is scabbed over; and do the same treatment until it is healed
Wise men say that to lament is key, and it is not without notice that according to the color of the wound it resembles a claw of a claw, and it is useful in all parts and especially in the lower parts of the leg and the buttocks, and because of these pains you must take it.
And when it has been admitted that there is a wound in the circuit of the claw, and that it is grasped with forceps or tweezers, and that it is eradicated from its root; do the same treatment with it
Or cauterize it as it is foreseen in the preceding chapter
But if a boil is seen to be a small rough fistula round about the surface of the body, and many of these are seen in the feet of children
The cure for them is to extend and insert that, or to open that same with a knife or to pierce the cavity. If you wish, cauterize that as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.
The greater form of this is a small swelling or fistula that arises on the surface of the body while moving forward, and when it is touched there it simulates the bite of a worm, and it is caused by the presence of cold humors.
And the cure for it is to grasp a needle of barley or of steel, and be strong, and place that on the worm within which it contains the circle of the needle of the parts of the body; and then turn your hand over the needle until you have inserted that which is in the circuit of the worm, and place that in the groin of the body, and evacuate the worm from its root.
If you wish, make that with a needle of horn or iron in this way:
The root of the needle will draw to the surface, deaf (so it is not perforated), covered so that the learning of the hand is abolished and the revolution of that
And if you wish, cauterize the worm as it has been said in the chapter of cautery of the burn
Like the instruments that are administered to give cries.
Some ointments are useful for cries of silver or lead or horn melted or malleated; and other ointments are useful for those small instruments large or small according to those which are administered, for whoever is administered in the cure of the little children is small; and of those whose buttocks are rough or painful, theirs are small cries
The way of making great and few cries
The head of the needle in which the bag is bound is wide according to this manner; and is to be distinguished by the place where the bag is bound thus as sometimes.
And the extremity of the limb which is inside the buttock, which is entered into the buttock, is deaf (so it is not opened) like a lion, backwards towards the substance; and on one of the sides of the limb are two incisions, and on the other side one incision, and the width of the incision is according to the size of the rays and the greater is a small one
And the bag in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheepskin are placed, and the root of the bag is a palm.
And it is perforated by means of four incisions thus as it is rotated; and if the space which is between the incisions is the thickness of the finger
And then enter through those incisions firmly with a needle which is of twelve needles, or more; and adjust that to that which is in the bag; and when it is placed in it the bag is stretched in the head of the cry between two distinguished persons with great constraint, and you cry over each incision: The better the quality of crying over each one is that you fill the bag with medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance; and take care that it is not too hot or too cold
And then the patient is placed reclining on the hips of two, and the legs are raised up and you place under them a cushion on which already lie or a cushion; and you anoint the limb with oil or with white of egg or with mucus of fenugreek or of saffron; and then insert that into the buttock with ease, and the minister grasps the bag and expresses that over two times and that with violence until it is evacuated from the belly until everything that is in the cry is evacuated; and then remove the cry and the patient takes their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces that to vomiting, hold it as much as you can; and if it sleeps like that for the whole night, it is better in the morning for the treatment
Better if you cry over the abdominal pains of the solution of the belly and the vomiting of it, the hour that you repeat the cautery until it is healed
And if in the buttock there are hemorrhoids or bloody abscesses, the hour is the cry not to be soft and like a lion, like the cries with which the children are accustomed.
Of care for the plagues
And I have already said in the division of the cure of the plagues that which was convenient for the free, and I say thus the cure of those with me and with medicines according to the complement
Therefore I say that the plagues are diverse according to the humors which are the cause of the plagues and according to the place where the plagues occur.
And the causes of these plagues are diverse, sometimes caused by gravel, or incision of space or rib, or percussion with the palm of the hand, or with the fist, or with a needle, or similar to these other causes.</end_of_turn>
The plagues that are in the parts of the body are also like the plague that falls on the head, or the shoulder, or the foot, or the belly, or the elbow, or the like of these that are on the limbs.</end_of_turn>
And I recommend the treatment of some plagues so that you can stop that reasoning and rule about the others.</end_of_turn
And I will begin with the simple head plagues, because the memory of the complex ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I say that when the simple head plague occurs and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is caused by gravel or something similar, and if it has already drunk the codena only once and is a great plague, and you are afraid that there will be apostema because of this illness, then you should immediately cauterize the forehead, and hold the head and the face as much as possible, and do not delay; and extract it according to the quantity of virtue in them, if there is no other cause that forbids cautery, especially if the sickness that is causing the plague is slight.</end_of_turn
And let the cautery be the opposite of the affected part; and guard the patient from repletion and fat and coarse food.</end_of_turn
And if from the beginning any cause prevents it, then reduce the food and do not approach meat or drink.</end_of_turn
And stop the plague, if there is apostema from the cautery, cover it with fat in olive oil or in wine in which it is stipticated.</end_of_turn
And if you are certain that there is apostema from the cautery, then stop the plague, if it is recent and the air has not changed that dust which I recommend to remove immediately.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already changed that, stop the treatment until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the plague is great or for incision of space or something similar, and their lips are not adjusted for pupils, then adjust those with sutures as I recommend for the sutures of them.</end_of_turn
And if the plague has already burst from the bone and skin, and it is not retention but a slight swelling, then puncture it and treat the plague with medicines and restore the limb almost in place of the codena, and command the patient to abstain from eating coarse food: heads and brains and things like these, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if you find putrefaction in the codena and it does not adhere to the bone, then you puncture everything that can be punctured and drain it out, and treat it like that.</end_of_turn
And if in these plagues there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and which is not severed by medicines, then inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is not severed, then puncture it with a spatula or ligature; and if necessary you will be forced to do what we have said, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.</end_of_turn
And if these plagues are simple and small, the cause of them is slight; thus you will sprinkle over them this dust, because when it is solidified it will be seen that the air has changed those.</end_of_turn
And the manner of the dust is this: take olive oil one part, of blood-root two parts, of astringent that is not extinct three parts; mix them all together and grind them, and let the plague be filled with it, and bind it with good constriction until it adheres, and coagulate with the blood.</end_of_turn
And strengthen that with dust and read it, and do not remove it until it is healed, because it is not eradicated by medicine until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And every time it does this alone, when it is not in your presence, it does great harm.</end_of_turn
And it does this work in great plagues when you command that it be stopped over those and that they be straitened, and so for recent plagues with their blood, which have not altered them.</end>
And if they have altered it, especially when it is in summer, then I do not understand the position of this dust, however, treat them with what we have said, namely that you stop over those abscesses already formed or that you stop over the grains of wheat of barley with water and honey until they have dried up; and treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.</end>
May it be that if an accident happens on the fracture in the bones, even if it is slight, then you shall extract what is causing it from the limb.
And I say that the care of fractures of the head is in that which it is venomous.
Of the plagues of the gut.</start_of_turn>
May it be that if the plague happens in the gut, then it is no different in treatment than when it is simple in the head.</start_of_turn>
May it be that if the nerves of the gut are cut or an artery, then if it is a nerve, it is not in its art but that it should be avoided treatment by means of what makes violent stricture, as when zinc or lead is applied, which is old and resembles that which is in the veins and that opposes that.</start_of_turn And do not stop with any cause of great cold, for the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is in the brain, which is the most important of all the members.</start_of_turn
And if it must be cured by medicines that are light, as when it is caused by a wet washing with lukewarm water, any vegetable juice infused in olive oil or not, and applied when washed with lukewarm water and the others that are mentioned in this manner, and oil.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the plague is great, then administer sutures, or bind the edges of the wound, and apply treatment with powders until it is healed.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the plague is deep or has happened to the lower part of the limb, then perforate that in the place most depressed.</start_of_turn
May it be that if in the plague an artery has already been cut and there is obtained flow of healing, then separate or dry that, or tie that, or cauterize that if necessary to prevent further bleeding.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the vertebrae of the groin or all of them have already been cut, and the veins of the gut have been preserved, then you adjust the edges of the wound with sutures over the hip bone and do not touch that; balance that and reduce that to its natural figure, and strengthen that by stretching it downwards, and keep it bandaged for several days; and treat that which causes constriction and excitement until it is healed.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the plague has already caused fracture in the bone, then pierce that, and if there are fragments of bone, extract all those that you can; and what remains, keep it bandaged until the plague has subsided, and separate it and relieve the swelling.</start_of_turn
And if the plague is recent, then sprinkle on that powder which has been recommended to you.</start_of_turn May it be that if in the plague there is a fistula, then treat that with the water from which the memory will come soon in the head.</start_of_turn
If it is percussion of the flank or the hip, and sometimes of the thigh, and sometimes of the depth of the wound, then consider more if it is from the plague or from excessive vomiting that the patient has; for the plague is mortal.</start_of_turn
And if it is not of great depth and the plague is recent at the beginning of the healing, then you pause in it for the first hour and sprinkle, do not stretch that because it may not be retained in the depth of the wound and return to the head and worsen the illness; more so do not touch that for a long time, but take two juices of vinegar and water every day.</start_of_turn
And if the vomit is not at your present, then you pause in the opening of the plague for a little while so that the water may succeed what is in the humors; and make the patient sleep over the plague so that the water which is in it may run out.</start_of_turn
May it be that if three days or more have passed since the plague and the patient does not have spasms or trembling of the body or pain in the belly or stricture of the bowels, and sometimes other good symptoms of the patient, then you may consider that the plague is saved; and then treat that with calm and the other treatment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
May it be that if the healing is excused, and it has already been open for a long time, then consider that the fistula is already finished; treat it therefore for the head.</start_of_turn
And if the plague is for incision of space or hip, and is simple on the surface of the foot or thigh, then treat that with water that precedes the suture, if it is great, or with powder, if it is slight.</start_of_turn
May be if there has already been an outflow of urine from the bones, and you suspect that there are pus-filled vesicles, then you should turn the plague and cover to extract those vesicles, if they are separated. May be if they are not separated, then you should loosen the plague that rests upon it, for the extraction of these is eased.</end_of_turn>
And with regard to the other plagues that happen in the other members, the help in their cure is the application of what we have already said.</end_of_turn>
Of the abdominal plagues.</end_of_turn
The discomfort that happens in the belly is either great, or little, or moderate.</end_of_turn
And a slight disruption is difficult for another way, and if you do not guard against the excessive handling, if you do not take care of the reimplantation of them at their proper place, they will open and become swollen because the intestines will be too soft.</end_of_turn
And therefore the best disruption is moderate, for in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, even though it is difficult in the two preceding species.</end_of_turn
And you know that the suture of the belly is done in four ways, but two sutures are common that are used in the sutures of the other plagues of the body.</end_of_turn
And two other sutures are proper for the other plagues, but they are only proper for the suture of the belly.</end_of_turn
And I recommend that you take into account each circumstance and declaration.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I say that when the plague is slight and there is any cause of the intestines for that, and it is difficult to reduce that, then it is in two ways: either by the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the intestines are swollen with cold air.</end_of_turn
And therefore when it is thus, you must cover that with your hand which you immerse a sponge soaked in lukewarm water alone, or that you grasp with lukewarm water squinant, and cypress, and pepper, and cloves along with the intestines until the swelling is resolved.</end_of_turn
And some veins cause this to happen in which there is sticking, and it is better that only water alone should be used to resolve the swelling.</end_of_turn
And when the swelling is thus resolved, then you must moisten the intestine with lukewarm water in which it is covered, because by this means the contents of the intestine are alleviated with little cause.</end_of_turn
But if the contents of the intestine are allowed to rest in this way, then you must cut the disruption with a small instrument with which there are inserted wounds.
The first treatment is better when it is proper that it should not be dry, and that it should not be an occupation to dry out what is not necessary and to starve.</start_of_turn>
Of the instrument, if you wish to know its form:
One part is sharp, and the other is not sharp, and the extremity is blunt, and it should not be as blunt as a sponge, somewhat obtuse.</start_of_turn
And when the plague is increased and comes out of the intestine, then you must cover that the reduction should be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible over water, because that is better.</start_of_turn
But when the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, then you must place the patient on his side, and suspend your limbs more above than the level of the head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you must suspend the head more and the legs more above than the other parts.</start_of_turn
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then you must suspend your attention and your consideration for a moment so that the part in which the plague is located is higher than the other.</start_of_turn
And in the large plagues and in the moderate plagues you must also administer water.</start_of_turn
And in the small plagues, suspend water that you have prepared, and make sure that it is administered between the most painful, which has the disruption throughout with its hand and adjusts the lips of it, and immediately uncover from that to that which if there is any cause should be another.
This is the translation of the first sentence:
And thus you tighten it firmly double in the circuit of the needle, and some veins of two parts together, and you add the two lips and the wound together by decent; and you lay aside the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that place, and you tie that one just as firmly as the first one; and do not cease until you have completed the whole contraction of the wound.
And if the needles go between fat and cartilage, for the fine needles do not scratch the flesh; and the large ones are difficult to handle in the codena, and therefore because of this it is necessary that they go in the middle of fat and cartilage
And do not let the needle be fixed at both extremities of the codena too much, for so the flesh is not scratched too much and the wound is opened before its consolidation.
And do not prolong the suture too much, for the wound is not prohibited from consolidation
And thus you puncture the extremities of the needles so that you do not cause the patient more pain; and you will stop sewing over expanded powder from all parts, which have the extremities of the needles; and you will leave them in until you believe that the wound is already consolidated.
These kinds of sutures with needles in cold weather are more convenient in small wounds, because they require only one or two needles or around those.
More common is the second suture: and that you administer the four extremities, of the codena and the two extremities of the cipa, in one vein, with a needle in which be firmly enclosed engulfs in the middle of fat and cartilage.
And thus when the needle has pierced these four extremities, reduce the needle of that middle part from which you began, so that the thread is drawn up without pulling out the pus that remains inside, for so the suture is like a proper suture with which the threads are strongly stretched.
And pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the middle finger
This suture is useful for men.
And thus this suture cured the wound which was inflicted on a man in his belly who was lying wounded by a wound in the major palm of his hand, and it was the disruption of the wound of more than two palms of the foot, and it was seen from the intestines around two palms of the intestines and was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and thus I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for forty-eight hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or around, and it healed; and thus I remained with him for not more than a year, and he was cured of his ailments.
And the other doctors had said that he would not be cured; but by a miracle, behold, I cured him without any medicine, because I only put on the bandage two times a day and bathed him with warm water until he was healed.
But I say two kinds of sutures are proper according to the narration of Paraula
And that you begin with the suture of the codena, and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus when the needle penetrates the codena and in that middle lacerate according to the rule and in the length of the whole body, and you leave the extremity of the cipa in which you have introduced the needle; and you make penetrate in the other extremity the needle from the inside to the outside in the other extremity of the limb.
And thus when you have finished that penetration, the hour you make that penetration once more in that middle extremity of the limb from the outside to the inside; and you leave the extremity of the cipa which is in that lace, and you make penetrate the needle in the other extremity from the inside to the outside of the limb.
And thus you make penetrate in that way the one that you made penetrate with which you make that penetrate in the cipa in the extremity of the limb which is in the part of the body which is in the wound until all that has penetrated
And thus you begin from this middle side and go towards that extremity which is of the cipa in the other side, and extract the needle from the codena which has penetrated, and then reduce that in that codena and sew the extremity of the cipa which is in the other side to this extremity of the limb; and extract that from the codena which is from the part of the body.
E fay aquo una veguada e autra, e fay aquo una veguada aprop autre veguada entro que tu cozes tot aquo que es deforo segon aquel eysemple.
And the sum of this method of stitching is that you sew through the skin with the thread, and when you have sewn through the skin, make a mark at the end of the limb, and read that other mark until it is completed
More especially, the second kind of stitching which we call Gualia, is recommended for this purpose, because it is similar to the way in which many doctors sew up, and they add to the surrounding area the necessary width, and they bring together the two ends of the limb with the other end, as it is proper to do according to your recommendation
Since you keep the needle at the ankle of the limb at your will, and you pass that through the surrounding area in that place, and read two marks; then reverse the needle and make that pass from outside to inside through two marks of the circumference.
And then reverse the steps, and make that pass through the surrounding area through the two ends of the limb which are outside; and so on through the rest of the limb.
This method of stitching is better than the common lighter suture, and is the suture of which experience reminds us.
This is the term for Gualia.
And more especially, when it is necessary to make several sutures, the belly suture is rectified with two needles, so that you enter with these through any part of the body, and you begin from the inside of the limb and make that pass through the other side according to the way in which those who sew up wounds usually do
You know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, the suture of that is more difficult than that of other parts of the belly
More especially, the treatment of the plague is judged by the other plagues.
The cause of which is that when you notice the recent plague in the chest, and the air alters that, and reduce the swelling and cozen that and put that away properly, when you pause over that dusty powder
And if the air has already altered the plague, when you pause over that spot until it makes the matter hard and tough, and tightens the limbs and head; and you care for that just as for the care of the other plagues until it is healed
And if you do not have the medicines, when you pause over that place, because it begins to swell up, wrinkle, and cause two marks to disappear, just as you have been taught, until it is healed, because you will not take any other medicine in vain when the plagues are simple
And if you fear that the plague will communicate infection to the principal parts, when you cover that with lion's mane soaked in olive oil of good quality, or in sweet oil, and you pause that in the area of the limbs between the armpits and the groin, and leave the dressings on them.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the belly, which is caused by many stitches that have been made, when you see that black sticky material there, and especially if it has spread in the belly and is useful to extract it by penetrating it within the cavity.
You know that the one that is in the great belly is more easily healed than the one that is in the small belly
And it is a difficult healing because the belly which is called “gegunu” does not receive healing from the plague like the rest; and that is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and for the greatness of it, and for the subtlety of the body of that, and for its proximity to nature.
And if what comes from the plague is the fabric, and if you have that recently, reduce that according to your custom when you reduce the swellings of the wounds
And if it has passed beyond that space and is already green or black, when you strengthen that with the thread over that area which is degenerated, in order that the flux of healing may come, because there are veins and arteries in the fabric
And so it is necessary to pierce that which is another thread, and suspend two ends of the thread pending the part from which the plague has gone out, in order that over you there may be relief from the attraction of that towards the cloth and the emission of the swellings of the plague
Remember the pangs when they occur in the intestines.
When the intestines are disrupted and it is slight, it is possible that it is due to remaining air from a previous abdominal wound, for it is known that when there is a wound in the lower part of the stomach, and it is old and closed, there is an evacuation of gases and distension of the belly
Then we must follow the treatment until it is confirmed that it is not necessary, for if the wound has healed and the area is consolidated
And we must say that when the area has consolidated, time has passed over the illness that was caused by the wound in the belly; and let no one tell you that there is any other illness that would make you abandon your meals and drink, and that you should stay in bed.
And indeed some experienced people say that when there is a wound in the intestines, and it is slight, it is necessary to ligate it in this way: that you take fragments of large heads; and that you adjust the two lips of the wound and place a fragment of those which are left over from the opening that you have made over the two lips of the wound; so that when you take hold of those and stretch your mouth, you will cut off the head, which adheres and is not dissolved
And do the same with another fragment as with the first, and do not cease until you have done as many fragments as there are in the whole wound.
Then return the fragments and close the wound; and keep those heads attached in the belly until the belly is healed; and do not let the patient suffer any discomfort at night.
And indeed it is possible that the belly is ligated with fine silk which is the custom of the beastly belly, which is more acute; and that you take hold of the extremity of these hairs of the belly, and without tearing, bind the extremity to the faithful thread, covering it, and bring that thread inside and close the wound, and reduce that in the disruption
This method of stitching with fragments is nothing but by faith and hope.
Moreover if the wound is great and wide, mostly if it is in one of the subtle bellies, which is not easily cured, and is not healed from the root.
Care of worms and fistula
You must know that every wound and swelling when it is old and decays, is a ulcer, and is not consolidated and persists always and is not cut off, is called fistula in every limb and is called that tumor.
And fistula in truth is a foul-smelling, hard, white tumor that causes no pain and which is depressed as if it were caused by an ulcer; and for this reason it is called that ulcer that has arisen.
And it is in moist humors that the fistula arises, which is evacuated; and when the moisture is dried up, it is dissolved in a few hours And some physicians say that this moisture is thick, little, great, and subtle
I have shown you all these causes, and the signs of them and the treatment of them with medicines in the division.
And I tell you that the cure for fistula is by means of surgery with the hand
You must know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; for some of them are fistulas that go through great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the liver, or the stomach, or the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to some of the vertebrae of the backbone, or to any of the compound joints as well as to the hand and foot; and of these that give proximity to the main limb and resemblance.
Therefore that fistula which is treated in this way is one of the most difficult to cure, and does not receive cure, and requires work and knowledge.
If the depth of any fistula surpasses these limits, and you expect and trust in the doctor's skill, and you wish to learn about it, then attempt to explore or palpate it, and if the fistula proceeds according to rule, ask about it directly from the doctor.
If the fistula is crooked, then attempt to explore it by pressing gently, for the pressure of the body's weight is alleviated and curved beyond the crookedness
And if the fistula does not have a horrifying movement, it is not your duty to explore it further
Then criticize the orifice for its orifices, for the moisture which causes you to criticize this one comes from the others and flows from them.
And inquire diligently, according to whatever way seems possible to you that you may learn if here are any nerves or vessels, and is the fistula long or short, or is it a fistula from which there comes several orifices and this one is above all the rest with regard to its size, with your knowledge, with what you remember of the patient, and with the cause of the pain which is under your compression with your hand over the area, and remembering the signs and the accidental causes at the discharge.
And when you have considered all these causes which we have mentioned, then go to the cure according to your confidence: and consider whether the fistula is apparent or distant from the bone, long or short of the joint, or of nerves, or of arteries, or veins, or from one of the parts which we have mentioned before and said
Then dry the fistula as it is said in the report, and stay away from all that is in that filtration and decayed flesh, and from whatever is born in the orifice of the flesh, or from pus and from remaining blood, and treat whatever has entered until it is healed.
If the fistula is of great depth and is according to the rule, then you must insert that into the preparation as much as your skill permits, and at the same time soften all your decayed flesh; and administer cataplastics covered in acute medicines, and introduce them into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with your hand.
And do all this while the acute medicine has corroded all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula from corruption
And finally restore those which we have evacuated when the flesh is healed.
If it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have recommended
If the cause of the fistula is bone and is due to your certificate, then inquire about it and dry it as we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or major limb as we have said
If bone is discovered in it in any corruption and blackness, then remove that which is rotten throughout; and treat that which is left until it is healed
And if it does not heal and discharge blood in this way as we have said, then you must know that you have not reached the root of the corruption; and then you must carefully inquire about it and consider the reason for it and the softening of it with your right hand, and restore that which has been restored
And thus if it is healed, well and good; but if not, you must know that that corruption is in the profound depth of the body, which has not been overcome, and then you must resign from that and leave that to fate
And if the corruption of the bone is small, or if you are able to extract it, then extract it with fine forceps which are suitable for this purpose
And if there is movement of bones, then carefully extract all of them, and do not leave any cause which may weaken you
If there is any contradiction from any of the humors, and at the beginning there is no fear or error, then insert those ligaments or flesh if they are here, and extract the bones.
If you are not prepared to extract the bones at this time, then stop over the wound until the wound has closed by itself, and leave that until what is around the bones of flesh and ligaments has become soft, and keep the wound from solidifying, and compress the area which you have incised in your operation
And if you fear it, stop over the limb immersed in boiling oil, or the limb immersed in Egyptian unguent, or in some of the ointments which are vertuous, for when they have softened those ligaments, and the bones are separated from each other, and from those which adhere to them, the traction is alleviated.
If it is a great bone, such as the bone of the limb or of the thigh or the like, and what is corrupted is only the surface of it, then extract that only after it has become callous and rotten, and restore the wound.
May be if what is corrupt is great, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, it is necessary to close that and everything surrounding it to prevent the spread of the corruption, and to cure that which has already arisen.
And I recommend that you appoint a companion to this man in his bed, who will watch over him and assist you in your operation.
For a young man about the age of xxx years, who has pain in his groin, and from whose parts the moisture has become mixed with blood in the body before it has reached the groin, this is a matter of great swelling, and not of an external cause
And so it is prolonged by the error of doctors until the swelling subsides, and I must say that this is a matter of great extent, and its cure is to be delayed until the wound has healed, and the parts affected must be supported, which are all in great pain, and the humors of the body grow languid.
And so many doctors have been consulted for two years, and I am not aware of any who have succeeded in this, except for me
I saw the wound of that man and the parts running from his wounds, for great pain; and already the color of that man’s body was pale and yellow
And so I introduced the needle into one of those wounds and reached the bone.
And I saw that they had all come loose from all parts of the wound
And so I withdrew and made an incision into one of those wounds through which I scraped out a piece of the bone, which was already black and rotten and putrid; and a part of the wound had already become corrupted since I had entered it
And so I gave him what was recommended to me and prepared from the exposed bone
I cured him that the corruption which was proceeding from the bone had already disappeared and I had already drained it
And so I left the restoration of the plague to conservative medicine for a long time, and it has not been consolidated
And so I repeated the process and discovered the same thing as before, and I found that there was still corruption in the bone
I saw that there was an appearance of that corruption again, and so I performed surgery to cure it and restore it, and it has not been restored
And so I found another vein and did not cease to puncture the bone little by little until I had reached the marrow, and I extracted that with the bone, and I restored that with medicine, and it was consolidated and healed completely.
There is no need to repeat the operation or section of the bone, except in the case of the discharge of pus and for the scarcity of the tolerance of the patient and for fear of death, which occurs in every hour from excessive evacuation without any bad result.
And therefore health is for whole healing, and nothing is better than the disposition of the soul in the body; and it is good to return to one’s senses and restore one’s strength; and it is confirmed in one’s actions and not by going against them in walking or sleeping or in any other way
But if it is prominent in the body already brought about, the hour covers that you must act in this way: take a piece of ligament and stretch it out at the end of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend that in its place; and tie that ligament of wool thicker than the first one; and put that over the bone which is left behind the prominent one, and stretch out the limb so that you can remove the bone from the parts that you wish to keep; and uncover the bone over the place where you want to close it so that the saw does not damage the bone.
And leave a little space below the bone adequately, because when you do this you do not prevent the saw from cutting the corrupt bone
And cover that the sawing should be done gradually over the corrupt area, because if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption does not appear to the sense, and forces the closure of the other vein.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, it is enough to remove a part continuously from the other, and the corruption is at medium or in part of it; then you uncover the bone throughout; and leave a little space below, and saw that part of the first part where the corruption is found until the closing of the other part is completed
And the sawing should be done according to the place of the corruption a little at a time as we have said.
If corruption is in the joint, incisions are made in that corrupted joint, and the bones that are continued from that part are serrated.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then the procedure is not in their ratio but is cunning.</end_of_turn>
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is not difficult; however inquire about the corruption in what manner it appears to you, and open that one, and tell me which method you wish to use, and I will rectify it for you, when it does not contradict veins or nerves.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must know what incisions are to be made and what instruments to use to cut these bones is not according to the position of the bones, and the preparation of these, and the size of these, and the thinness and greatness and smallness of these, and the hardness and rarity of these; for it is necessary that you prepare for all kinds of operations the appropriate instrument for that operation.</end_of_turn>
Therefore you must know that this operation means for you the kind of instrument from which you inquire; when indeed it is great study and long and with knowledge of the methods of this art, and testimony of the methods of healing, that the hour has already passed for you with regard to these things that are convenient for these ailments to all diseases.</end_of_turn

The instruments used in this procedure resemble those of India, and it is suggested that this treatise encompasses various methods of treatment for various ailments.</end_of_turn
From the incision of the extremities to the closure of the bones.</end_of_turn
The extremities are supported either due to an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic cause, or when you have treated that corruption for healing with medicines and the healing does not interfere, or sometimes the corruption goes away by itself without affecting the limb; in such a case, it is necessary to make an incision in that limb where the corruption is located so that the disease does not spread further to the death of the limb or any other serious defect.</end_of_turn
The signal of that to which this happens is that the limb is affected with black bile which has not been purged out, or that it becomes pale towards the black bile which has remained in that limb and which fills the whole body; and thus you must know that it is caused by that.
Similarly, if the cause is from the percussion of various venomous matters such as a scorpion of the sea or a viper or from urine or from any similar thing.
And if the corruption or percussion is in the extremity of the finger, then you must immediately mark it and do not give space to the corruption because it has entered the hand
Similarly, if you arrive at the hand, then mark that from the root of the nail, and do not give space to the corruption until it is expelled from the nail of the hand
And if you see that, then mark the arm within the fold at the joint.
And if another one comes, the corruption and the time that has passed around the fold, then in that is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause after that is useless, for the quantity of virtue is insufficient.
Similarly, if there is corruption in the foot when it is mentioned, then mark that within one of the nails
And if you grasp the foot, then mark the whole foot May be it has entered the nail, but you must mark the limb at the joint of the nail
And if the corruption has already spread over the nail, then there is no other remedy but dismissal, and leave the patient to his death.
And the manner of marking the limb or cutting it is that you grasp the limb slightly above the point where you wish to mark, and grasp another liament over the area; and extend the minister a liament to the points below, and extend the minister another liament on its; and you separate the flesh which is between two liaments without stretching too much of the skin until the whole flesh is uncovered; and then you mark or cut
And you must keep the hand still from all parts so that it does not touch the area; and bring the patient comfort adjusted and apply cautery afterward.
May be blood flows when working, but you must cauterize the area cautiously, or suspend them until any powders which tighten the blood have been removed; and then return to your medication until it is completed
And so tie the affected limb with a liament or as you deem convenient, and care for it until it is healed
And I advise you that whenever you see a person with black bile in the knee, this means an accident which I have seen and which I recommend, which is that it should be treated as if it were a combustion of fire.
That corruption first appears in the knee before it extends throughout the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself for it because he saw the care given to the limb with great diligence, and he inflicted the bite on the limb at the joint, and immediately healed him
Long time ago that bite of corruption in the finger of the hand was indicated
And then I came to know that this superabundance was causing great damage to the hand of the physicians, because of the multitude of medications; and it is not causing the superfluity but is causing the disease to progress from the hand to the other finger until it reaches the foot
I am imploring you to mark the hand, and I do not fear the repercussions of that superfluity, for I rather fear the death of the patient, since the virtue of the medicine is above all these things.
And when I awoke from my sleep, I learned that that man had prepared and marked his whole hand, and he was healed
I have not related this story except to show what happens in this disease, and to give an explanation of what is signified by it, and for what purpose it is useful
From care without heat and the quality of clustering with physicians.
When an abscess forms in a fleshy limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until the collection of pus has occurred, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the pus is discharged from it; and the area that was under the abscess appears as if it were a vessel, and the cord that is under it is loosened as if it were a subtle tremor, and it is not affected by the main infection, neither does it imprint on the bone or nerves or ligaments, for it is called a wound, and it is not named an abscess.
Mays empero si le spazi es prolonguat entro que la corrupcio enprema en alcun membre, la horas es appelada fistula e no zukem.
And the treatment for it is that you insert the sponge completely again as before, and more so when it is subtle and is done gently, and comfort her that it does not adhere to the area for its corruption.
Moreover if you hope that the sponge will adhere and that the corruption will not succeed by its consequence, and in the sponge there has appeared pus, then treat that like a blister
And consider the wound, and if it is great, and if the hand that you are using smells of fetor, then treat that like an Egyptian medicine which is of oil and vinegar and rue, receiving parts of vinegar, and be adjusted in a vessel, and be covered over the fire until the medicine becomes soft and reaches its full extent
Then take from them what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; and treat the wound with that, strengthen the edges of the wound, and leave the medicine in it for the space of two hours.
And extract that from the wound; and make water for so many days until the wound is healed and the pain is gone
And some herbs are treated with water of ashes, when it is not at your disposal this medicine; and that you take the ashes of vinegar, and put them over water; and when you have bound that, treat with that until you are confident that the wound is finally healed
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of the ashes, then treat with water and honey and vinegar which is mixed with honey, because the property of honey is to soften and wash away, and the vinegar makes the wound adhere, and especially when there is excess of styptic substances and dryness in the vinegar.
And when you have finished treating some herbs and you are confident that the wound is healed, then treat with water that makes the flesh swell in it.
And take from rue extract and dissolve that with scented oil and vinegar styptic; or that you treat with that any medicine that has the properties that I have already written in the treatise on remedies
And if the edge of the wound is straight in which the cannula of the syringe is not received, then you must enlarge that part little by little, and rest it in gauze enveloped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is enlarged.
Similarly if the edge is wide, then you must stitch the edges of it and leave them as much as the amount that is necessary to fill the cavity of the wound
And if the hand that is supporting the wound is elevated to the upper parts, then dry that in the hollow place that is in it so that the hand can run outside, for when the hand is contracted in the bend of the wound the flesh will be stretched out in it
And if it is not possible for you to dry the wound in the vicinity of the bone according to your wish, then you must order that the limb be prepared in the preparation for which the hand is eagerly prepared according to your custom and that no cause be retained the hand.
Moreover that which is over the wound, which you must keep for an hour in total so that it escapes from the pressure of the hand. And to know if the liquid that runs from the hand is thick or thin, or is digested or not digested.
And take into consideration the condition of the patient, if in it he feels pain or not, and if there is swelling in it
When the treatment has lasted in this way for a long time, and you see that the matter that has been applied to the edge of the wound has already adhered, or has appropriate adherence, then you must remove the dressing or change it every three days, and when you remove the dressing, change the bandage.
May it be that from the root to the tip of the limb there is a subtle virus, however, do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, for in some there is a delay in the generation of flesh during the summer months, and in others there is a benefit from its contrari.
And if from the root to the tip of the limb a few days have passed and the limb does not adhere, it is evident that the adherence of the limb is delayed; and if the adherence of the limb is delayed and this is the prolonged cause, then you must adjust in excision of the medicines, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry just as if they were vinegar, when adjusted in excess to the addition of alum.
And thus it is more proper that you take vinegar of today and dissolve it in olive oil, and let it go over the wound in its substance, and keep it warm, and use it up.
And thus it appears in that action, when not in vain, vinegar of today, honey when it is cold, and use it; or that you take myrrh and aloes and incense, crush them all and powder them over the honey when it is cold, and put lines of this over the wound and strengthen that over the limb; and lines of this over the honey which has been cured until it is engrossated, and powder over the wound and strengthen that
And many physicians administer with this the long and learned art of astrology and the reasons of the celestial bodies (and it is a celestial body) and barley of barley and centaury, and use of these simples or adjusted, crush them and burn them and powder them over the honey which I have recommended; and use of these things.</start_of_turn>
And if the limb is prolonged and it is not cured by this treatment, it is evident that the corruption is in the root of the limb, and already make an inquiry in the bones or in the other members distant or to the ligaments; then you must treat with fistular care, as it is said.</start_of_turn>
Treatment of swelling and pain of nails and additional incision of the finger and section.</start_of_turn>
Swelling is the swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger or toe, and often in the other fingers, and when it is prolonged and its treatment is less esteemed, or when it is a post-traumatic swelling or is corrupted, and pus comes out until it corrupts the root of the nail, and it is very corrupt in the whole, and it causes the limb to become limp, and the color of it is pale.
Therefore when you have that which we have said in the division and you do not confirm your treatment, it is evident that you must inscribe all the superfluousness that is removed from the nail and immediately cauterize the wound immediately with that which is useful. Because cutting is not of use in this.</start_of_turn
And if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nails are already freed from their roots, and it starts to swell and decay, it is evident that you must leave out the obtuse angle of the nail which bites the flesh at the root, and push that back and cut that away with ease, and place your hand over what remains of the flesh of the medicines which burn away the corrosive parts until it is all gone; and then treat that part which remains until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if the corruption already penetrates the bone, it is evident that you must extract the bone and extract it, for no time is it healthy that it should be corrupted in it.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes the corruption and the corruption go down to the finger, it is evident that you must cut it off at one of the joints as it is preordained, and then treat that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the nail has percussion or swelling, and if there is acute pain, it is evident that you must at the beginning apply a cold compress to the patient, and immediately dry the nail with a sharp knife by cutting across it, and keep it that the cutting does not reach the flesh which is left under the nail, because it will cause increased pain, and if there is an excessive discharge of blood from the wound; and treat that area where the pain persists.</start_of_turn
Thus it is said that which is natural in the greater number of men is very strong in the flesh, and is strong only in the bones, or is strong in the nails.</start_of_turn
And these are born in the root of the joint, or is the birth of them in the bones of the fingers.</start_of_turn And that which is born in the bones of the finger does not deteriorate, and that which is born in the joints is more corrupt.</start_of_turn
And of those which are born fleshy, the cutting is light, and it is that you must cut from the root with a blunt knife.</start_of_turn
May he of that one who is born of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore guard him from infection.
May he of that one who is born of this, protect him from the infection, because you will set out the marrow of the limb as round as the bone, and then close with one of those needles which are convenient, and then cure that which is sound.</end_of_turn>
May the consolidation which happened in these limbs which are born of the home which did not go out or by the birth of the fetus, or by the consolidation of pus or by the burning of fire, or by remaining still, then guard that consolidation until these limbs return to their natural form.</end_of_turn
And then pause between their clothes with olive oil so that they are not consolidated too tightly, and separate between these, or pause between these a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as much as is necessary.</end_of_turn
And in the same way if consolidation happened in these limbs with the palm, then dry that consolidation as much as is prepared and bring it to the figure of the limb.</end_of_turn
From the beginning of vice, so are varices.</end_of_turn>
Vices are varices, and these are veins enclosed with thick veins filled with melancholic fluid which flow in the limbs of the body, and their greatest advancement is in the legs of travelers and laborers and porters.</end_of_turn
Then guard that you administer purge from the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then draw blood from the basilica vein from the patient.</end_of_turn
May the cure of these be in two ways: one is that it is without pain and that you apply that black ointment, and the other way is that you elevate the vein and extract all of it.</end_of_turn
The section of these is in this way: bandage the limb at the beginning with cold water until the large black ointment is resolved, which is fruitful for the limb, and then strengthen the limb of the patient to the upper part of the thigh with a bandage, and then dry the vein in one place, or in two, or in three at a wide section, and then elevate the black ointment to the lower part of the thigh until the amount you want to extract has been taken out, and which will tolerate the virtue of the patient.</end_of_turn
And then leave it like that, and command him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.</end_of_turn
And repeat the cure with flebotomy when the veins are swollen and when the patient feels pain.</end_of_turn
May the elevation of these be in this way: raise the limb of the patient, if there is swelling in it, and put him in a bath and bandage the limb with cold water until it is stiff and the veins are relaxed; or that it be exercised by strong exercise, if there is no bath at your disposal, until the limb is bruised.</end_of_turn
And then dry the cord in the groin of the vein by cutting in the long or behind it you must give it a bruise, or in the bottom of it you must make it callous.</end_of_turn
And then open the cord with scissors and scour the vein throughout until it appears, and you must know that sometimes that request will decline to blacken.</end_of_turn
And therefore when you have evaded and cut the cord, sometimes that white which remains is cord.</end_of_turn>
And then you must put your hand on the back of the thigh until it is elevated and is freed from the cord, and suspend that with an ointment of orp or lion.</end_of_turn
And then make another incision near that incision for three fingers, and then scour the cord from the part below the vein until it appears.</end_of_turn
And then elevate that and make an incision in the lower section you must make it callous, and then extract that and elevate that until it is expelled by the second incision, and extract that from the section that is above that.</end_of_turn
Do that until you have extracted that from the most elevated section or from all the sections, until everything is expelled; and then make that incision.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey my order to extract and elevate, then insert a strong needle with a double bend and tie that and extract it, or insert your hand into the thigh and rotate your hand throughout until it is numb.</end_of_turn And guard that it is not injured; for if it is broken, it is difficult to elevate that limb and it is harmful to the patient for that night.</end_of_turn
And when all other things have been taken away, pause over the area of the wound that is submerged in wine and vinegar, and heal whatever is within that is sick.
If the wound is contracted having torment at the parts which are covered, and it is not according to rule as we have said, then pause that you make incisions over the whole extent of the torment of those parts and at the places of covering them, and then suspend that until the whole has healed.</end_of_turn>
And take heed that you do not cut the vein and that you do not wound that, because it will be difficult for you to raise that; and use your prudence in this matter.</end_of_turn>
This sentence is incomplete and does not provide any text for me to translate.
It is not acute like nails nor of great extremity so that it does not wound the vein; and it has great flexibility, because if it were subtle, it would wound the vein by its subtlety; there is great thickness in it as we have said.
Of extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein arises in the swamps in the lower regions like the Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the dry lands of India where there is little vegetation and little rain.</end_of_turn>
And it is also generated in other parts of the body in other swamps.</end_of_turn
And its generation is of putrefaction which leaves the rotten flesh like that of serpents and worms and beetles and worms that are generated between the rotten flesh and the marrow.</end_of_turn
And a sign of the coming of this is that the vein which is in the inflamed area burns violently; and immediately the place is swollen; and then the vein begins to rise from the place of that swelling as if it were cut by a plant.</end_of_turn
And thus when you see the limb, then cover it with a lead weight whose weight is that of two drachmas. Enter it to two drachmas, and note that and leave the weight suspended from the limb.
And as many times as the cause is at the parts outside, cover that with lead and do not touch that.</end_of_turn And if it is not prolonged, pause that you make an incision of a part of it and cover the remaining; and do not touch that until it is outside and discharged, because if you touch that it is contracted and enters the marrow and causes swelling and redness in the place and ulceration.</end_of_turn
So that it is treated gently and is extracted little by little, until it is discharged from behind it and does not remain in the body for any cause.</end_of_turn>
And from this vein is extracted in bulk which is in its length of five palms and a thumb and I have already known that it is completed to twenty palms.</end_of_turn
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, pause that you make a hole in the groin of the limb and perforate that along the limb with the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and give putrefying medicines to the place for several days with medicines; and then care for that for the healing of the apostemas.</end>
And this vein has many veins associated with it, and especially when it appears at the ankle or in the foot, and it is caused by some obscure orifice.
And therefore care for that as we have said in the division and as we have said before.</end_of_turn>
Of cutting over worms generated under the skin and is called bovine dropsy.</end_of_turn
This disease is called in every land bovine dropsy because it often happens in cows and is very little one that is not between the marrow and the bone, and goes through all the body pushing and devaluing, and is shown by the feeling of desire to raise the limb from limb until it breaks the bone and comes out.</end_of_turn
And its generation is from the putrefaction of some humors as well as from the bites of worms and serpents and lice and worms in the belly.</end_of_turn
It is feared for its malice, for when it comes into the body and is raised to the head, it is reached to the head, and it is completed by the strength of its heat which enters and destroys the head, and that which is left over causes many veins to burst.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, do not do so without previously relieving its pain and discomfort, and until you have confirmed that what is above it is loosened and what is below it is relaxed and constricted firmly. Then dry the area thoroughly and extract it.
If it is swollen and painful and does not yield, then pause the cautery above the area where it lies until you reach the root of the cause, which is corruption of the humors that causes the swelling of the limb as we have already said.
If sometimes the patient approaches the head of the limb, then strengthen your grasp over the limb with great firmness, and dry the area thoroughly, and extract it. Let the patient take an purgative medicine that evacuates bad humors, and keep them from eating foods that cause corruption.
From the navel to the knee there is no swelling.
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is a pain that is seen in all parts of the body, and it is usually transferred from limb to limb.
And indeed I have already seen such a case as the one you have recommended to me I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I found her hands swollen, and I saw a small swelling in the funis vein of the hand, and when I left an hour later, I saw that the swelling had disappeared just as if it had never been there, in the same way as if I had seen gold shining when it moves from place to place
Then I applied a cautery to the area of pain and remained there for an hour.
And I did the same in the other limb until I reached the other hand
And I recommend to you that you do the same throughout the body as I have seen; and I was amazed at the transformation of the limbs and their swiftness I have already seen such things in my travels according to this manner, but I have seen many others that suffer from pain that is transformed from limb to limb But I have not seen anything like that in the girls.
And I do not think that this is anything but that the woman was old, when her bones were dry and her veins were exposed, and in this appearance there appeared to her that swiftness of transformation.
And it is necessary that this does not appear in those who are delicate and have humors in their bones that are covered by veins
When you wish to cure her and she experiences that pain, do not be deceived by her outward appearance just as we have said. Strengthen your grasp over her and leave her with great wonder and dry her thoroughly until that swiftness has disappeared, and then cauterize the area
But if you do not see it in the thighs, at least cure the one that is excess of the limb and that expels swiftness, and praise those that are like laxatives and like pills of serapi, and so on
Of the extraction of arrows
Arrows are diverse according to their species and the parts of the body in which they are found, because their diversity is that some have large heads, some have small heads, some are concave, some are blunt, some are solid; some have three angles, and some have tongues; and some have stems.
And from the symptoms of the servant it is when the arrow has penetrated him, and has passed through his bones, and is sitting on the cyst above the head, which happens because of its violent discharge, vomiting, dizziness, convulsions, vomiting of the bowels, swelling and vomiting of the tongue, spasms and mixture of understanding and vomiting of bile, and great loss of speech and destruction of the voice, and it is sitting from the place of the disease a white moisture resembling drops, and is like the abundance of the limb.
And if you see these symptoms, then you must abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, if not outside.
The sharp pain of the arrow is like that of a wound in the heart, so that it is from the left breastbone, and it is not from a wound; and the movement of the arrow is like that of an intestine, like the black plague, and if there is any coldness of the limbs, and swelling, and lack of breath; therefore one must know that death has descended upon him at once.
And the swelling when the arrow has pierced the lung is like the spitting of blood of the plague, and the veins that are near the gut are swollen, and the color of the patient changes, and great breath is exhaled, and he demands an attraction of fresh air
And if the arrow enters the membrane which is in the feet, and the pain is in the small bones, then there is great pain and swelling, and he groans with great pain and breathing is difficult, and the muscles of all the limbs are affected
And if the arrow enters the stomach, then there is great vomiting like that of the walking plague
And if the arrow enters the belly, and it remains there, there is spitting of blood like that of the plague, or a wound or swelling of the intestine which is broken, and there is no hope for the cure of it except for the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow enters the bladder, and comes out with urine, and progresses from it to the outside, and there is great pain in the patient, then one must know that it is mortal
And the other members also are saved as the face, the head, the armpits, the shoulders and the flanks, the ribs, the sternum, the spleen, the kidney, the bladder, and the limb bones, according to the greatest abilities, when the arrow does not find any vein or artery and is not venomous
I would recommend that you take note of the behavior of these arrows, for it is an indication of the way to treat them
The cause of which is that in a man who was hunting an arrow pierced the tear duct of his eye in the root of his nose, and I extracted that from him from the other side, leaving the pupil of his eye intact, and he was healed, and did not suffer any damage to his eye that night
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who had been pierced by it in the gray of his eyebrow, leaving the eyebrow intact, and the arrow was already hidden and could not be found except for a small piece which adhered to the eyebrow, and it was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with gold in which there were no scales.
And thus was the Jew healed, and did not suffer any injury to his eyebrow except for the wound made by the arrow
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who had been pierced in the armpit, and it was an Arabian arrow, and there were scales on it; and when I was examining that between two ribs, and it was already submerged in the armpit of the patient; and when I was taking it out I was very careful with that, and finally I extracted it, and the Christian was healed
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been pierced in the lower belly, and I thought he would die from it; and therefore, when more than thirty days had passed and there was no improvement in his condition, I examined the arrow and extracted it, and he was healed, and did not suffer any injury from it
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had entered both of his thighs, and the plague was consolidated over them, and when I approached him seven years had passed, and I extracted the arrow from the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman who had been pierced by an arrow in the lower belly, and the plague was consolidated around her, and it did not improve in her condition even after repeated attempts, and the woman did not suffer any other natural illnesses during that time
And I saw another man who had been pierced by an arrow in his face, and the plague was consolidated and the arrow was broken, without any pain or discomfort being perceived by him
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who had been pierced in the middle of his nose in the eye, and it had already declined from the wound a little, and the arrow was completely hidden.
And I was called to take care of him within three days of the arrow entering
And when I arrived I found the plague of the arrow completely gone; and when I asked about the cause of her suffering she did not feel any pain; however, she still felt a slight tingling sensation from the wound left by the arrow
And I plastered the area around the wound with an astringent and digestive plaster, confident that the wound would disappear when I showed her the location of the arrow, as it is accustomed to happen in such cases
And it is not surprising that the arrow has reached that place; I will continue to press on it for several days without causing any further harm; and when the swelling has subsided, the patient will be cured of their pain within the space of several days, even though the arrow has been withdrawn from its place for a whole day.
And thus I will leave the acute corrosive medicine on the wound for several days until I have opened it up, and when I have cleansed and treated the area, I will remove the tip of the arrow which adheres to the flesh
And I will adjust the opening of the wound for that acute medicine until I see the tip of the arrow again, and I will do this at my own pace over the course of four months.
And when the swelling has subsided, I will try to bring forceps into the wound to remove the arrow, and I will do so without causing damage, for I will carefully and ingeniously handle the matter in such a way that I can start to remove the arrow from the following day, as the situation allows, until it is finally extracted; and I will restore the wound after that
And many doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored, and I restore that as well, and the swelling subsides, and the pain is healed completely, and I remind you of this in every case.
I advise you to take into account the quality of extracting some arrows, for I have not mentioned everything that is to be known concerning this, for the parts of this art and the subtleties of this are not comprehended by the narration or by you
And the learned artisans compare this with little things; and they take into account what is present as well as what is absent; and they discover new operations and new instruments which must descend from the causes of this art when it arises
Therefore I say that arrows are not to be cast out of the members in which they are stuck, but according to two methods: either by pulling out the limb in which they are entangled; or by the contrary side of the other part.
And that which is stuck by the limb where it is entered, or is an arrow proceeding from a fleshy limb, is thrown out and cast out.</start_turn>
And if you do not obey this order at the time when it is given, the hour demands that you leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh has healed, and that the attraction of it and its egressio be relieved
Similarly, if it is stuck in bones and you do not obey my order, the hour demands that you leave it for several days and reiterate the attraction and movement in every day, and it will be cast out
And if you do not obey my order for several days, the hour demands that you perforate in the circuit of the arrow in that bone from all sides until the limb is swollen with the arrow, and then extract that.</start_turn><end_turn>
Maybe if the arrow is already hidden in the limb and is hidden from the feeling, the hour recommends that you inquire about it, and if you feel that it is necessary, the hour will order that it be extracted despite the discomfort that this may cause.</start_turn><end_turn
And if you cannot do it because of the constriction of the swelling and the length of the period, and here neither bone nor nerve nor vein is concerned, the hour recommends that you remain vigilant over the swelling until it is swollen and that the arrow can be extracted.</start_turn><end_turn
And if you have other things to do which are urgent, the hour recommends that you split the surrounding flesh from all sides with all your skill; and think about it, if you cannot escape the flesh from the fracture of the bones and its rotation until you obey.</start_turn><end_turn
When you extract the arrow from any part of the body, use your thumb and forceps to hold everything in place until you have finished doing so; and take care to ensure that the arrow is not broken and that it is easily removed along with the extraction.
If you are unable to do this immediately, leave it for a few days until the swelling around the area has subsided; and then repeat the procedure when the pain has subsided.</end_of_turn> Moreover, if there is an outflow of urine, administer what has been said above as treatment in the preceding chapter.</end_of_turn>
Beware of the incisions of veins or nerves, or cords, and administer whatever is possible to facilitate the escape of the arrow; and do so with speed, calmness, promptness and gentleness as much as you can and as your patient recommends.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, pull out the arrow in the direction opposite to that in which it entered, so that the pain is in accordance with the shape of the wound from which the arrow was removed, which is more beneficial.</end_of_turn If this is not possible, administer what you can according to the figures.</end_of_turn
If the arrows have gone out in the opposite direction of the other part, or if they have already gone through some part to the parts outside, or if they cause stiffness in the extraction of the arrow due to the sensation of the parts below the codena propera and sometimes even the cord itself; then hold that part down; and make the incision according to the quantity with which the forceps grasp; and then draw out the arrow, which will be lighter in this way.</end_of_turn
If it is retained in the bone, twist the bandage counterclockwise until the arrow breaks against the bone, and expand it further, and then extract it.</end_of_turn
If not, leave it for a few days, and then repeat the procedure until it comes out.</end_of_turn>
And if the pain from the arrow is in this place, then prick it with your finger.</end_of_turn
If the pain is severe and you wish to administer an injection, then insert the needle and that, if it is blunt, twist with caution so that between the curvature of the needle and the tip of the arrow there is contact, and then prick it with your finger.</end_of_turn
If the arrow is concave, prick it with your finger towards the curvature, for the arrow will be relieved by this.</end_of_turn
If the arrow is venomous, cover all the surrounding flesh with something, if possible, and take care of that as well.</end_of_turn
If the arrow has pierced the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the ribs, and is close enough to touch with your hand, grasp that part and if possible drain the wound, then extract the arrow, and hold the wound closed if necessary, and care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
The provided text does not include information regarding the shape of the forceps mentioned, so the requested data could not be extracted from the given context.</end_of_turn
Keep the extremities of the forceps like the beak of an owl, which are useful when they grasp the arrow so that they do not leave it behind.</end_of_turn
There are various types of forceps, large, small, wide and narrow, depending on the quantity of the size of the arrow and the thickness of the wound, and the constriction of the wound.</end_of_turn
Like a ray so that the sensation of the wound in the concave arrow is relieved and is gripped by that.</end_of_turn
Extraction of the veins.</end_of_turn
The provided text does not include information regarding the specific veins that are typically bled during an extraction, so the requested data could not be extracted from the given context.</end_of_turn of which there are sixteen in the head.</end_of_turn There are two pulsating veins that are close to the armpits, called the brachial; two veins that are in the two temporal bones that appear; two veins that are in two tear ducts of two holes that are called the lacrimal; a vein that is in the middle of the forehead; a vein that is at the tip of the nose; two veins that are at the cheek; two veins that are in the lip above; two veins that are in the lip below; and — these are called the palpebral —; two veins that are below the tongue.</end_of_turn May the veins that are swollen in the ankles be evacuated through the bladder. Of those veins which are cephalic, one is lateral, and the people call it the “royal vein”, and it is silent, and it is a median vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica, and of another branch of the cephalic; and they call that which the people call “the vein of the whole body”, and basilica is the vein which is stopped in the domestic lap, and is called “citellar”, and they call that which the vulgar call “the belly vein”; and funis of the arm, and is stopped over the elbow, and is that in which is flecked, and is that which appears on the thumb for the appearance of the disease; and the salvation, and is the vein which is between the great toe and the little toe, and is in them two branches.
And in the foot and the leg there are three veins; one of those is left outside the curvature of the little toe; and the second is posterior, and its place is left outside the domestic lap; and the sciatic vein, and its place is left outside the little toe; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The support of the veins which are near the ankles is to catarrh ancient and emigration and safra and ulcers of the head old times.
And the quality of burning those veins is as follows: you must recommend to him: that he keep his head still during the disease, and that he frequently move his head to the back of the skull where the two veins are widely open and move well; then tighten the patient's chest with a bandage around which appear the two veins and their places are close to the ankles in two places depressed from the head; and you must keep the hand that you touch, and if you sit on the hand of those that you touch, here you will feel a tremor.
Then take the pointed lance, which is the incision, and insert it beyond the vein in the heel where the inflammation appears to go to the bone And then elevate your hand to the vein and the heel to the buttocks and incision the vein at the incision point. And the length of the incision should be the quantity of two thumbs adjusted or around that; and do as much as you please from the holy ointment as much as you wish
And tighten with powder and leave that which is within until it is healed
And already before proceeding with the treatment of the opening of those and their cauterization
May the two arterial veins which are at the temples be of assistance in the inflammation of the gout is emigration ancient and so bad and chronic and swelling of the joints acute effusive at the heels.
And the quality of causing inflammation of those is as follows that I recommend to you: constrict the patient's chest with a tight embrace until the two veins appear to the sensation of appearance of the disease and that you feel their pulse left hand; and when you sit on them you will feel a tremor.
And elevate the heel over the vein to the buttocks and touch the hand left hand indicating, and insert the inflammation of the vein from behind, and elevate the vein in its place; and incision that as well as you did in the two other veins; and do the healing according to the quantity of your need
And remove the dressing of the patient, and suspend your hand left hand on the vein for an hour, and suspend on that bandage and powder and tighten that which is within until it is healed
And already before proceeding with the treatment of them, and the opening, and the attraction in the beginning of the freedom.
Therefore the support of the inflammation of the vein of the front is the support of the median vein to the ancient maladies of the face and to emigration and swelling and ulcerous tumours.
And the quality of the inflammation of those is as follows that I recommend to you; so that the patient tighten his chest with a bandage until the vein appears; and take the instrument which is called forceps of which this is the form.
Pause the prominent point which is at the head of the forceps over that vein and puncture it with a slope or in another way in the manner of him, and leave the healing run according to the quantity you wish; and remove the perforation of the patient and tighten that which is within until it is healed
And many doctors open the wound of the inflammation at the ankle, but it does not follow that the inflammation is of acute extremity just as the others, because it can also be of remote extremity, and the inflammation is as it is across the bones that are proper and strong lean towards the inflammation when it is subtle
The two veins which are at the tear ducts of two heels provide help in the scab of the heel for the pain and swelling of the face.
The quality of the inflammation is that the patient grasps the collar with a bandage, and then inflates the swelling with these instruments. You should stand over the patient's head.</end_of_turn>
The inflammation should be carried out according to the physician's instructions, a little at a time, so that in the area there is no solid matter. If the inflation is too sudden, the limb is fractured.</end_of_turn
Then run oil from the flask as much as is necessary, and place your hand over the area, and tighten them for a night, and then remove them.</end_of_turn
The inflation of the vein of the nose is connected with acute fever and violent sweating, and with the face pains, diarrhea and swelling that happen in the face, and more so when it is chronic.</end_of_turn>
The quality of the inflammation of the nose is that the patient grasps the collar with their left hand, and brings their nose close to your hand, and makes the inflation slowly and stays in the middle of the face according to the ruler, so that the vein does not appear to the feeling here, and that the oil begins to flow freely.</end_of_turn
Because you must finish your hand slowly with the inflation and run oil according to your need; and place it like that for a night, because it is restored with pleasure.</end_of_turn
The two veins which are at the tear ducts of two heels provide help in the scab of the heel for the pain and swelling of the face.</end_of_turn
The quality of the inflammation of these is that the patient grasps something under the collar with their limb and liams them; and the physician should place their instruments over the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a cushion.</end_of_turn
Then inflate the vein slowly with wide inflation little by little; and extract oil according to the temperateness of the quantity or according to how many times it is necessary; and keep the other vein still.</end_of_turn
Then remove the limb and tighten the two veins closely so that the patient does not suffer, and place within the wound when the disease is healed.</end_of_turn
The help of the inflation of the veins is comparable to small apostemas and ulcers of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and to bad ulcers that are in the nose and in the circuit of the face.</end_of_turn
The quality of the inflammation of these is that you must make the patient spit out beforehand, grasp the collar with a bandage, and rotate their lips; and demonstrate that there is blackness in either of both, and more so when it comes to the circuit of these two veins being more dark; and where the lesion comes from is for the lesion itself to tell.</end_of_turn
If you doubt it, and do not know which of these is the cause, when you arrive at the incision of the greater of these, and the pus reveals itself.
And keep the two veins that are in the lips separated.</end_of_turn>
The two veins that are in the lip provide more help with the inflation of the cavernous sinus than with the pain of the uvula and the pain of the mouth.</end_of_turn
The quality of inflating these is that you must keep the patient between your knees while they are spitting out the sunlight, lift up the tongue, and keep the tongue away from both veins, and the color of either is declining towards blackness.</end_of_turn
And then inflate anything; and take care that you do not touch the veins with your hand, because they are arteries.</end_of_turn
And the veins which are inflamed in the groin are usually the ones in which blood flows constantly in all men, and the inflation of these is useful in two ways, or by making the inflation wide and slow, or by making the inflation narrow and high.</end_of_turn
If the pulse is strong like sometimes, convene that we open the swollen veins that appear gross, and to those that contain much thick blood.</end_of_turn>
This flebotomy is of less breadth and of finer extremities, and we convene to perform it on subtle veins that contain a slight yellow color.</end_of_turn
More helpful is the flebotomy of the basilica vein, which is one of the three veins: from which it extracts the blood of the diseases that leave it pale, and from which it takes the blood of the legs and the abdomen.</end_of_turn
And we convene to the flebotomist that when he performs this flebotomy, he should be careful so that he does not tear any artery, and if he should err in the puncture of the flebotomy, he will endanger the artery and cause blood to flow, so that he must interrupt the bleeding immediately, either by ligation or by cautery as desired.</end_of_turn
And if the basilica does not appear immediately, then we must leave that one and move to the other, or seek any branch whatever; or that we perform the flebotomy on the wrist instead, which is most obvious; and we must seal that one immediately as we have said.</end_of_turn
More if you want to make the flebotomy of the median nerve, then we must previously loosen the bandage that is on the arm that we are about to puncture until we reach the location of the pulse; and we must then place another bandage over it and hold it in place; and we must ligate the arm and seal the vein with a concave incision as we have said; and take care that the percussion should not reach the space of the artery.</end_of_turn
And when sometimes, as we stretch the ligament, swelling appears in the place that we have marked with a bandage, then that swelling is an embolism of the artery, and therefore avoid that.</end_of_turn>
And if sometimes blood flows in the flebotomy just like urine of a child, and the blood is thick like that of an artery, then you must know that it is the blood of the artery; and you must quickly stop that bleeding by holding the thumb over that for a long time; and when the bleeding has ceased, which is when the blood has clotted, then you must strengthen the arm and leave that.</end_of_turn
And take care of the patient's urine, and be careful of him and do not neglect him for any days until he is healed.</end_of_turn
More if the blood has not clotted, and sometimes you must not have a physician at hand, then you must puncture the artery if it appears to you; because the limb is contracted, and the blood is clotted; or take a little fist and press that, and take hold of the thumb and strengthen that over the area of the vein where the stricture is descended from the ligament and the cartilages until the next day.</end_of_turn
And if the blood has clotted, that is well; otherwise, care for that which precedes the recollection of the place of the clots from which blood flows.</end_of_turn
And the bleeding of the arm is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of the ligament of the arm.</end_of_turn
More, the flebotomy of the brachial vein is useful because it extracts the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And we remind the flebotomist that he should be careful in the flebotomy of the arm, because that is a nerve; and if he should puncture the vein and damage the nerve, he will cause him to lose sensation, and that is difficult for recovery, and often it is not healed at all; for this nerve is delicate and is not always visible, and if it is hidden from some people and is subtle and is not shown, then we must stop the flebotomy at the point where we suspect that the nerve is, and avoid the nerve with our strength.</end_of_turn
And if the vein is between two nerves, then we must cut the vein lengthwise.</end_of_turn
The usefulness of the cephalic vein flebotomy is that it extracts the blood from the head and comforts the diseases of the limbs.
And we say in this way, if you wish that the flebotomy be made by olive or merit flebotomy; because that is the safest of all veins, because it does not endanger the artery or the nerve.</end_of_turn
The pain is not in the first percussion, but is found afterwards, therefore it is not a fleumatization.
The first is that it is not administered except in the conservation of health and with the hope of success and with care to avoid diseases, and that it is useful to perform the phlebotomy in one of the veins which are in the groin: cephalic, femoral and basilica; and that it is useful to perform the phlebotomy at the beginning of spring, after breakfast in the spring and autumn, and in winter almost at the cessation of food, when there is a significant sign of repletion
It is also useful to perform the phlebotomy every third day or after three hours of the morning meal
When the phlebotomy is administered, when it causes convenience and necessity at night or day, in every hour and at all times.
And you must know that it is not to be phlebotomized until there are thirteen years, and that in women it should not be phlebotomized until the fourth month after seven months, and in old people it should not be phlebotomized those who have already passed their eightieth year
And when someone wants to be phlebotomized for any reason, you must modify their veins before the phlebotomy with a lion's bladder clamp, if there is a retained tear, so that the veins do not draw out the excess of the blood from the veins of the belly, which are pressed, and that they do not bruise the principal members
And they should not be phlebotomized the sick who are convalescing from a sacred illness or from a relapse, nor from a disease or from drunkenness, nor because of a colic or because of vomiting, nor because of a large accumulation of wind or of other causes that dissolve the virtue, or because of bodily or spiritual suffering, or because of excessive sexual intercourse or of excessive fasting or of any other exercise or neglect of food or sleep or of any other cause that may weaken the body or spirit
And you must consider with great subtlety in the administration of humors when the patient is fat, on foods and drinks, and on medicines if it is possible to do so.
And you must abstain if any cause prohibits, or if you exercise too much by any exercise so that the patient is discreetly treated
And suspend the phlebotomy in the feet of the day, so is around the third hour, as we have said
And take care that the feet of that day be kept free from all animal accidents, as is fatigue, rage, fear, and all bodily accidents, as well as excessive work and unnecessary sorrow and anxiety, and from all causes that may weaken them
And with regard to the cause from which the majority of men suffer with aromaticness and odor, and with moisture and smell, and according to the quantity of possibility.
And follow the phlebotomist with a cushion that is thicker than the cushion of that which should be phlebotomized
And draw out the limb with both hands, and cool that which is with the hand of the phlebotomist twice or three times; and then bind the limb with a bandage and cover that with two or three layers of gauze.<end_turn>
And the tempering must be temperate, neither too tight nor too loose, for if it is too tight it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose it is too soft.
And with regard to the tightening, you must make sure that the one who is to be phlebotomized cools his hands between his thighs before the veins swell, and that he declares it himself.
And the phlebotomist should take hold of the limb with a little olive oil on his hand; and then pause the hand indicating the hand that is to be phlebotomized, so that the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is calm because the vein which is to be phlebotomized is the one which has been seen to flee like a rope from the phlebotomy, and from those is that is filled with wind; and when the phlebotomist pauses on that which is contracted from the phlebotomy, it is discerned by the phlebotomist; and the phlebotomy does not open the vein, and if it opens, that is stretched.
Therefore, in order to be successful the phlebotomist must be skilled in all these matters.
And as for stopping the phlebotomy, even if the vein is ruptured in a moment, it is not good; and if so, you must repeat it another time and leave that place a little while, or over it you must make fasting, if that place is not apostematized
If the limb is swollen or the patient is in great pain, leave them be for a day or two and do not bind them tightly, for this may cause further swelling or damage.
Repeat the incision if necessary.</end_of_turn>
And if the opening is small and the blood is bleeding steadily, and you fear that it will not stop bleeding to the desired extent, then repeat the incision in that place according to custom and apply a little pressure to the area, until the limb is no longer swollen, for the limb is swollen in many homes due to little incision.</end_of_turn>
Even if sometimes the limb is swollen, do not repeat the incision, for this is not useful for any reason; rather pause at any point of the wound, for this relieves the pain.</end_of_turn It is better in this limb to use oil rather than any other oils.</end_of_turn>
Similarly, apply oil to the entire incision whenever you perform an incision, and prevent the blood from clotting by means of compresses or other similar substances, so that when it is stopped, the pain is diminished because the swelling is reduced.</end_of_turn
If there is great swelling in the area of the incision due to blood clots, especially if the bleeding has not stopped but the clot has appeared, or in the small opening of the vein, then cover it and pause over the limb a sponge soaked in warm water and salt, slightly rough, for an hour, as it is dissolved.</end_of_turn
And cover that with another vein alongside it or another vein.</end_of_turn
If there remains for a few days some blackening or greenness in the limb, do not notice it; and if you wish, pause for a moment for any other reason, such as the loosening of the dressing or the dissolving of any pus or other matter.</end_of_turn
Blood clots and clots caused by the incision often cause swelling and eminences around the incision of the basilica.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, keep your hand on that area, and if you notice too much swelling, put your compress on that area, for that swelling is harmful and bad; and take care that you do not leave it until you have treated the cause of this, for the blood flow in the main vein is strong.</end_of_turn
Apply cold to the area where there is pain, so that the limb is hardened, and take care of the other care as before until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Take out of the limb to all extent according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the wound over the limb according as it appears.</end_of_turn
For if the limb is black, leave it alone until it is well; and similarly if you see that it is sometimes thick, leave it alone until it is reduced; and similarly if it is acute, until the acute pain has passed.</end_of_turn
And concerning those who are full and strong and who have had to have their limb extracted in a single clot, amplify the incision of the vein and the bleeding must be great.</end_of_turn
And in those who are pale, do the opposite of that, and extract that in multiple clots, and that the opening be direct.</end_of_turn
The best way to perform an incision of the vein is in a transverse section, not a puncture.</end_of_turn
This method of incision is safer from bleeding and nerve damage, and is more successful and safer than the incision that is made in a straight line.</end_of_turn
And in the case of copious bleeding you must perform the incision, and take care of that immediately before the incision by placing a little bit of lint or simple sponge soaked in vinegar on the wound; and extract three or four clots from the limb.</end_of_turn
And if there is coldness of complexion, before performing the incision, prepare by infusing into the wound eyewater of myrrh or eyewater of aromatic oil with spices such as fennel, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or aromatic and scented eyewater.</end_of_turn
And if there is excessive bleeding, you must perform the incision, and for this prepare by giving the patient wine and aromatic eyewater; and use aromatic substances with some vinegar, and keep the area clean.</end_of_turn
Make use of the other causes that have been mentioned in the chapter on excessive bleeding for evacuation.</end_of_turn
And thus it is desired that the patient's arms be raised and his hands dissolved according to custom, covering them with a sponge which has the property of promoting gentle evacuation, for its virtue is cold, which expels the seed gradually, according to the quantity of virtue in the successive days.
And thus it is desired that the patient's arms be raised, and his hands dissolved according to custom, and his body is strong, so that it makes almost seven or eight hours from the first evacuation
And thus it is desired that the seed of the body be thrown out in the opposite direction of its inclination, covering that it should be accomplished on the second or third day.
And thus it is desired that that body in which there is already seed that is acute and causes fever, covering that the seed be evacuated once and a great quantity of it, and that the perception be increased until the crisis passes, because you have preserved all the conditions of evacuation; and that you place your hand over the side of the body towards the stomach, because if you do not do this, death may ensue from the crisis rather than from the crisis itself, for the flebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And do not cover when you wish to remove the arms and evacuate the seed according to custom, when the orifice of the vein is already closed and it is difficult to expel the seed, for you must remain submissive before that excessive desire and extend your inquiry widely, because too much is bad
There remains within that it should be bled according to custom; or you remain with the acute of the bleeding which is coagulation of the seed in the orifice of the vein; or pause upon that of tyriaca alum or of sage, and press that until the seed is gone and has gone out
And if the vein is clotted, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the clot has dissolved.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the seed according to custom, and it is not excused, then you must take that about that place or in the other arm in another vein
And the vein called “funis of the arm” is bled in the place of the flesh or of the bone, when it is not obstructed or hidden, because it is composed of those things.
And the quality of the bleeding of this is that the patient puts his hand into cold water until the pulse has cooled down and that the vein appears clearly visible
Then strengthen that about that limb with that tight bandage; and bleed according to the small transverse, not latitudinally or longitudinally.
And the perception should be wide and your bleeding should be such that you bleed that over the wrist joint a little.
And if the flow of the seed is prohibited, then you repeat the hand in cold water and let the seed run in the water until you have achieved your need
And if you were in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of the hand in cold water, and the month is stopped the body of the seed in cold water in the winter months
And the bleeding of this vein is more harmless than that of all the others, because it has no pulsating vein or nerves
The bleeding from the wrist is related to the diseases of the foot.
And the quality of the bleeding of this is that you strengthen the hand with the bandage or with your hand, because you have put it in cold water, until the vein is swollen and is clearly visible at the same time; and bleed that transversely; and if you do not do this, nothing will result from it.
And conserve that you do not touch your hand with the bleeding, because it leaves them naked without flesh.
And repeat the hand in cold water and let the seed run in that, because if you do not repeat that in cold water, the seed will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow.
And when the seed is extracted according to the quantity of need, then you pause over the vein oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too firmly; and simultaneously cover that you make a complete circuit.
And the help of the bleeding of that of the left hand is that it is related to the diseases of the heel
And do the same with the bleeding of this.
And the help of the median vein in the bleeding is for the diseases that are in the parts of the body, such as diseases of the major part, and retention of menses, and the diseases of the veins and ulcers of parts and old wounds, and their like.
The quality of the inflammation of the foot is that the patient drinks cold water and it causes friction within that area until the veins become apparent; and it extends over the ankle joint; and the place of the vein is cut off which appears to be swollen, and from that so branches out on the surface of the foot more or less.
Therefore the inflammation must be drained freely or leave the limb as it is because of the collection of pus, which is better and safer.</end_of_turn>
If you drain the inflammation on the surface of the foot, then take care of the nerves that are left over on the surface of the foot, and stop draining when you have reached the point where you would like to stop.
And so be the drainage done.</end_of_turn>
May it be forbidden to immerse the limb; however, you must immerse the foot in cold water and allow the wound to drain in that area until it is evacuated.</end_of_turn
If the physician is mistaken in the first part of the treatment, then repeat the drainage a little later, because the place is salty; and do not fear its malice, but take care of the nerves as we have said.</end_of_turn
Similarly do the same with the other foot in comfort.</end_of_turn>
As for the sciatic vein, the place that we have said is above the heel and below the heel of the silty part.</end_of_turn
The benefit of the drainage of the foot is to restore the ankle when it is for a wound burn.</end_of_turn
The quality of the inflammation of the foot is that the patient drinks cold water and it causes friction within that area until the veins become apparent; and it extends over the ankle joint; and the place of the vein is cut off which appears to be swollen, and from that so branches out on the surface of the foot more or less.</end_of_turn
And therefore when it appears, then take the drainage as you wish in each case and as you think, and that is better; or insert that by incision or drain that by incision, because the place of the wound is salty.</end_of_turn
And this is in most homes not known; and if you find it, and it does not appear to you, then drain some of the limb, and that is the one that appears in the two toes rather than in the heel and the ankle.</end_of_turn
Take care of the nerves, and allow the wound to drain as much as you wish.</end_of_turn
Then loosen the stricture and stop over the point of the drainage hole and strengthen the place, because by curiosity it is healed.</end_of_turn
From the draft and the qualities of using these things.
Winds are of corn, or hemp, or ivy.</end_of_turn>
And the draft is done in two ways: one of them is by sacrifice and extraction of pus, and the other is by draft without sacrifice.</end_of_turn
And this draft which is without sacrifice is done in two ways, either with fire or without fire.</end_of_turn
And to the drafts which are administered with sacrifice and extraction of pus are fourteen parts of the body, of which one in which the drafts are stopped is the ankle; and the fifth part of that from the two parts of the heel; and the drafts from the chin down to the jaw; and drafts from two thumbs; and drafts from the heel down to the ankle; and drafts from two nails; and drafts from two wrists; and drafts from two elbows.</end_of_turn
The draft does not extract the pus except from the small veins scattered over the flesh, and by that it does not cure the origin of the disease; just as it is not useful for the drainage of the limb until all the parts of the body are evacuated.</end_of_turn
And if it is necessary to provoke a draft for disease or for continuing, administer it at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and at any other time.</end_of_turn
Therefore, whenever such a thing happens, and particularly if it is in the third or fourteenth day of the month, it is customary to command the patient to drink a laxative that has passed two or three hours since the previous dose.
Furthermore, the evacuation from the neck is that when that is conferred to gravity in the head and towards the water that is sunk down to the heels; more than that, that is the right evacuation of the whole body.</end_of_turn>
And this evacuation is in the place of phlebotomy of the head.
It is not permitted to use it of those who are of full age, or in which there is catarr, which gives great discomfort.</end_of_turn>
And for this reason it is not permitted to use it of the old people, and in the heads of those who are suffering from raging fevers.</end_of_turn
Moreover, whenever that is prolonged over them is fruitful oblivion; and for this reason you must command the attendant to stop his hand a little with the ventouse at the heel, fearing the generation of oblivion.</end_of_turn>
Furthermore, the evacuation of aloe is in the place of phlebotomy of the yellow vein and the basilica: and for this reason it confers relief, and to the constriction of bile and to the scissura of the bile stone, and to hiccups, and to distension.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary to mix the aloe ventouse with a little oil, because if it is left out too long, it generates debility in the body and in the stomach.</end_of_turn
And the evacuation of chamomile confers relief to accidental pains in the head and to ophthalmia, and diarrhea, and deafness, and toothaches; and it is in the place of phlebotomy of the basilisk.</end_of_turn
And you must command the attendant not to touch his hand too much with the scarifier, so as not to puncture the artery and cause the flow of blood to stagnate.</end_of_turn>
And the evacuation of the lips makes the breath comfortable, and repairs the gums, and helps with the affections that are in the mouth, and it is in the place of phlebotomy of the marrow that is in the marrow of the bones.</end_of_turn
Moreover, the evacuation that is fruitful on the two spatulas confers relief to capitation, which is fruitful for the repletion of heat.</end_of_turn
And the evacuation of the two veins that come out of the bones confers relief, in addition to phlebotomy of three veins, that is, of the basilica, yellow and cephalic, which is that which attracts all those veins more abundant than are in the belly, and those smaller veins of the other veins more abundant until it reaches the attraction of the three veins.</end_of_turn
And you must command the attendant not to proceed too much with the scarification, for the place is denuded of flesh, and there are nerves and arteries there.</end_of_turn
And it is a ventouse with which it is recommended to evacuate over the pillows and which confers relief to the hemorrhoids of the buttocks and to the ulcers behind the heels.</end_of_turn
And you must command the attendant that it be a strong ventouse, and that it be of lead, because the place easily withstands a strong section; and that the strong winds be evacuated with subtle scarifications and that it be done with a scarifier.</end_of_turn
Moreover, the greatest winds that are given for the most insignificant matters, because they take away the blood of all the body, and confer relief to the ancient pains of the kidneys and of the bladder, and of the uterus; and they cause the menses, and confer relief to vomiting and diarrhea; and they are in the place of phlebotomy of two superficial veins, and of the spleen, and of two large cavities.</end_of_turn
However, they do not cure all the diseases and cause fainting in many people.</end_of_turn
And the greatest benefit of these winds is proper to the benefit of the winds of two large veins.</end_of_turn
The quality of the position of the winds is that it pauses the incoming wind at the beginning and allows it to go out gradually, and does not prolong the position of the winds, but rather pauses them leisurely, and keeps them moderately, and that the humors come to the place by chance. And do not stop iterating until you see the place already relaxed and swollen and that the color of the blood returns.</end_of_turn
And when you have finished the scarification, repeat the evacuation slowly and gently, and pay attention to the condition of the body.</end_of_turn>
For that kind of person who has soft flesh and thin blood, you must give him a slight scarification and not too deep, because the place is not to be ulcerated.</end_of_turn
Command the attendant to widen the incision and bring in a little more air, and let me know when the suction is ready.
If there is much swelling in the joint, then it is necessary to make two incisions. The first incision should be made at the bottom of the joint to open the passage of the tendon and fluid of the joint.</end_of_turn> The second incision should be made near the top of the swelling to facilitate the extraction of the large joint.</end_of_turn>
If the joint is not yielding, then make a third incision at the top of the swelling to reach the deeper parts.</end_of_turn
Finally, when we want to remove the joint slowly or in pieces, hold a little incision open.</end_of_turn
If we want to remove the entire joint, make another incision around the previous incision; and if we know that the joint is large, then make a more extensive incision.</end_of_turn
The depth of the incision should only be as much as necessary.</end_of_turn>
And if the limb is large, tough, and fleshy, and its vessels are very straight, then you should oil the area with softer unguents, such as almond oil, violets oil, or chamomile oil; or in summer, olive oil of aloes or olive oil of violets, or olive oil of marigolds, or olive oil of poppy seeds. And in winter, you should use olive oil of mastic, or olive oil of lilies, or olive oil of camomile, or of rue.</end_of_turn
And if the excess is large, fatty, then you should use olive oil of amaranth, or olive oil of balsam, or olive oil of aloes, or olive oil of pennyroyal, or similar.</end_of_turn
And if the attendant has wide hands with tough nails, then you must prohibit him from using oil, and you must order that the area of the veins be washed with lukewarm water, or with cold water of salt, or with vinegar, or with chamomile water, or the like.</end_of_turn
And if the joint has much moisture, wash the veins with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, sage, and chamomile, or similar.</end_of_turn
And if the excess is large, wash the veins with strong vinegar, or with broth of rue, which is elderberry, or decoction of pennyroyal, or camomile, or the like.</end_of_turn
And you must keep the area covered with a bandage; having said that, it should be applied immediately after the bandage has been removed for an hour or two, and that you should rest at the area of the wound.</end_of_turn
What should be done so that the wound does not bleed before the wound is sutured?
You must first consider: if the attendant or the one who is to perform the flebotomy is cold and windy, and if the joint is acute and inflamed, then you must anticipate cold causes, such as mustard seeds, vinegar and oil of rue, chamomile, alum, and rosemary, or the like.</end_of_turn
And stop feeding him such foods as poultry, fatty meats, and dishes with vinegar, and the like.</end_of_turn
And if the completion is fatty, then you must anticipate giving slippery substances such as almond oil, slippery elm seed, sage, and fragrant herbs between meals; and you must recommend that he abstain from fatty foods and meat, fish and shellfish, peas and beans, and eggs.</end_of_turn
And you must drink more liquid than food on the day of the wound and the flebotomy.</end_of_turn
And you must remain at rest for several hours before breakfast, or take medicine such as rue seed or alum, or chamomile, before or after the wound or the flebotomy, so that the main members are comforted and the joint is softened; and do not take any food during this time.</end_of_turn
But the wounds that are to be made are not to be made on the chest, the foot, or the navel, in the area of the joints, or the armpit, because these members suffer from the incision.</end_of_turn
And it is not desired for these except for the attraction of the joint of a limb, as when you suspend the wound over a swelling of the limb; and you use this to dissolve the cold swelling that is hidden in the limb, as well as over the belly and the navel; for this makes the limb limp and smooth the pain that comes from the swelling.</end_of_turn
And indeed it is stopped concerning the groans when these happen in their operation or pouring, for by the power of strong attraction they bring about the emptying of the urine from its place.
And thus it is when it is stopped concerning the fetus and the belly, for there must be velocity in those enclosed.
These winds are administered wet with vinegar only; and some are administered with oil.
And some are administered full of cold water in the diseases of the belly.
And thus it is because the wind must be full and great, so it is only cold water or water in which herbs are boiled as is convenient
Form of wind administered with oil: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, according as we have formed it; and the quantity of oil is that of a palm; and it is placed on the flanks of the belly, in the part that is in the circumference, the palm of the hand, the thumb is small according to the quantity that enters it with a needle
Whether from eggs of roe or citron, from orange marges, lion, swallows and others for so that it does not harm the limb its position over it.
And let there be at the middle of it a transverse scar of eggs or iron, where a candle is placed with the flame.
And indeed let this wind be much greater than the one we have recommended; and the little more of that according to the diseases and the state of the one who uses it
And the winds of the elders and extenuates are others than the winds of the young and of great stature.
And the quality of making this wind burn on the limb is that it extends the flesh with the fire of wood conveniently leaning a little candle of wax, and place that on the middle of the transverse scar in the middle place of the wind, so that the fire is kindled around the edges so that it does not burn the body of the patient
And thus it is stopped concerning the limb of the patient, and the hand is said to be about the thumb that we have said, until when we have the winds and we do not indicate that it should stay there and that it should exhale the vapor over that thumb, the hour the wind will be so much dissolved.
And thus we burn the flesh according to its manner, and repeat that if you indicate it to us of that.
More in the wind that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with vinegar, in which there is no transverse scar or thumb, and is not administered except that it is full of vinegar, and is stopped only on the limb alone
And thus it is: the greater this wind is, the better, for it receives a great quantity of vinegar.
End of text.
Blood does not arrive in many members but in those in which it is not possible to place the wind, for the smallness of those, thus as the thumb and the index finger and resembles them; or in a limb naked of flesh, thus as the hand and the nose and when it resembles them.
And the quality of using those that you have found blood in is that they are in the warm waters of poppy seed mud
And thus they are left lying down during the day and at night in warm water until they become faint; and that no remaining cause remains in their belly; and let the body be evacuated at the beginning with a trocar and with winds; and let the limb of the patient be cooled down until it turns red; and let them be stopped over it
And thus they are full and thus they cease.
And if it is possible to suck out the cavity with the wind, it is better for the benefit.
And if not, the hour you wash the cavity with wine and then with a little bit of vinegar; and let it be wet and squeezed out
And if the course of the illness is prolonged, and the blood remains, the hour you put in a sponge of lint in cold water, and stop that from being placed over until the discharge is finished
And if the illness is multiplied, the hour you sprinkle over it powdered vitriol, or urine and resembles them of the stiptic causes until the illness is cured; or that you place over the limb the greatest amount of cooked beans, and leave them until the beans adhere to the limb, and that is the illness cured
And so, if necessary, repeat the application of blood, when it is possible to change those
If bloodletting is forbidden, then frequently cauterize the area recently or leave a needle in the area until it heals; and in this way the pain will cease to exist.
When you wish to calm them down, sprinkle over them a little of ground alum, or salt, or ash, and they will quiet down.</end_of_turn>
Thus begins the procedure of the third part: restoration.</end_of_turn> This chapter is very important in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones.</end_of_turn
Oh, fool, learn from this chapter those foolish doctors and the vulgar people and those who have never read the books of the ancients or who do not heed their words.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is right that this madness among the scientists in our land is private; and I have not forgotten it at any time; and I have not abstained from teaching it, except for the length of my reading of the books of the ancients and my study of their understanding, until I had extracted the science from them.</end_of_turn
And I direct you to experiments and studies throughout my life.</end_of_turn>
And I have already said in this chapter all that pertains to my science and about which I have experimented; for I have abridged it from you others and delivered it from the burden of prolonged discourse; and I have opened it in the end of brevity; and I have shown you in the end of the declaration; and I have formed in this way many forms of treatment which are administered in this way, as it is seen in addition to the declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.</end_of_turn
First Chapter.</end_of_turn>
Summary and collection concerning fractures of bones, from which it is necessary to begin before we proceed to the remembrance of fractured members and the various methods used for each one.</end_of_turn Therefore we must speak in this chapter about the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters which are necessary for understanding which at the beginning of this art were forced to the artificers and to stay on the truth of these things; so you and those who are commanded to learn this noble art from you.
Therefore I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twist or similar case occurs, the custom is to cover the beginning with flebotomy or to support that limb, or whatever else, if it does not prevent any cause, as is fitting for virtue, or if that is the cause of the accident, or if it is in decrepitude, or if it is in the time of violent heat or violent cold.</end_of_turn
And concerning food, we allow only mild herbs and boiled meats of birds and fish; and we prohibit large meats and fatty foods and all food that engenders blood in the veins of the patient, until you are sure that after cautery the blood has clotted, and if you do not fear the effusion of matter from the limb.</end_of_turn
And when the patient is well again, return the patient to their primary place as soon as possible.</end_of_turn
And when the bone is beginning to be restored, it is necessary that the patient should not be given nourishing foods of great bulk and difficulty in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat flour cooked with water, broth, eggs, fish, beef, pork, fresh herbs, and large bread and similar to these; and in this regimen there is coagulation of the fracture more pleasantly and gently.</end>
And you must know that bones break when they are in the homes of the first youth and the decrepit, and it is not possible that they should be continued and consolidated according to their nature by the exhaustion of the limbs.</end_of_turn
However, nature adjusts and remembers that a broken bone of any part whatsoever that has increased in size that adheres and strengthens that which is together until it is congealed and joined together, until the end of fasting and feasting, as is the case at the beginning, until any cause prevents that.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is necessary to abstain from feeding the patient, foods in which there is gravity and viscosity and bigness, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And you must know that the species of fracture are various according to the variety of the limb, for the fracture of the limb bone is different from the fracture of the head bone; and the fracture of the toe bone is different from the fracture of the thigh bone; and in the same way all the others are different from each other.</end_of_turn
E yeu venc am rememoracio de tota specia de fractura, expausada en le sieu capitol distincta del otro.
I remember that there are many kinds of fractures, which are exposed in the different chapters of the book. There are various kinds of fractures of the bone in their multitude; for some fractures are bowed in others they happen in the stars; and some are split according to the length of the bone: and some fractures are of the tibia and fibula, some of the forearm and elbow, and others are from injuries and not from them, just as it is in the case when writing is prepared, and it is a fracture with bruising and disruption in the head, and it is a fracture of a slight fissure.
And for every kind, there is an appropriate remedy or treatment to restore them according as it will be remembered in the different places
According to all these fractures of the bone, there is a signal of the bone fractured And for this is known that the bone is fractured: it is the torturing of the limb, and the emergence and appearance of the limb to the feeling, and so when one comprehends it with the hand
And therefore, when there is no apparent torturing of the limb or if it is not suspected, you must touch the bone with your hand without causing excessive pain, for there is no fracture there.
There is also a possibility of slight torture or fracture, so do not place your hand on it with force or compression; there must be pause of the medicines of which you remember at that moment when it is convenient; and do the same for strong structure
And you must know that the limb when bowed is not fractured in two or otherwise as if it happened in the marrow, as is remaugued all the rest of the parts of the body; therefore, when the time comes, you must begin to correct the injury from this moment
And if the injury happens later, you must leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides; and then apply any method that can elevate and treat the wound
And you must know that the restoration of the limb and the healing of the wound are lighter than the bone in which the marrow is fractured<end_turn>
And do the same as it will be remembered later.
Moreover, even if there is marrow in the bone, it is necessary to extend the fractured limb from two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or one string and your hand.
And keep the limb in the position in which you found it, while the fractured parts are extended from the limb; thus you will perforate that the wound should be made in the place of the fracture and according to any method that you can use in those places
And keep your force so that you do not cause excessive pain in the wound by your operation or injury; and perforate according to the power that you apply to one bone with the other companion according to various methods
And you must take advantage at that moment of your touch with your hand and, if sometimes there is any other cause, rectify that and heal that for the amount of your skill
And avoid excessive extension and compression, just as many foolish doctors do who perform injuries with pointed cautery in order to perform their operation, or who perform constriction of the limb in the same way as they have seen others do in their operation.
And the quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you must know that fractured limbs are diverse in their size and in their greatness and in their form
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the toe, you must know that the covering must be of soft material.
And for those that are large, such as the thigh or the chest, you must know that in those you must have a firm and hard covering, which will connect the great limb with the strong limb that is being stiffened and keep them from slipping from the engagement.
And now begin, quickly discharge the urine, pause the liament conveniently at that place, over the area of that fracture with three coverings or four as it seems; and strengthen your hand a little at the liament.
And now look at that part above the area of the fracture, and strengthen less than you have strengthened the area of the fracture itself.</end_of_turn> And now lengthen a little the covering over the area of the fracture, and soften the stricture gradually, until you can grasp the area with a large part.</end_of_turn
And now take another bandage and wrap that other bandage around the area between the fractures, and now look at the coverings towards the lower part of the fracture; and perform your operation on the stricture of the covering and in the softening of that as we said in the first covering.</end_of_turn>
And now rest between the swellings of stoplion or marrow which is equal to the twisting of the fracture, if there is twisting of the fracture; and do not rest in it for any reason otherwise.</end_of_turn
And now rest on the other bandage, and cover these coverings well; if there is no swelling or cautous abscess in the area, and when the abscess has gone down and the swelling has gone down; and leave that for several days; and when you have strengthened the area again.</end_of_turn>
And so be the edges of the bone somewhat blunt, and be formed wisely; or be of the heel of the foot; or of the edge of the palm of the hand; and be the width of any bandage according to this form and this figure.</end_of_turn
However, the dressing that is placed over that fracture must be larger and wider than the others; and the length of the bandage according to what is legible for the limb in magnitude and in thinness; and strengthen the other bandage according to your first stricture; and bind down loosely as we have said of stricture, and that your stricture is greater in the area of the fracture, and the more prolonged the fracture, the more must the stricture be.</end_of_turn
And it must be that the threads are finer in thickness and in flexibility, and be of silk; and if the threads are thick, thus it has been seen in the operation of many fools who have bound the fracture with threads of cord, and this is a great error, when they loosen the stricture before it is equal.</end_of_turn
And fine threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve the stricture with them for those things that you wish, and do not cover that there should be less than a finger between the dressing and the dressing.</end_of_turn
And if the patient is such as for the edges of the bones, strengthen the stricture in those places. Then rest until those of stoplion or marrow are no longer causing him injury.</end_of_turn
Some bandages for fractures are like a plague, and an accident of disruption in the cord, and I remind you of that in the capitol according to singularity.</end_of_turn
And know that a limb that is fractured is not immediately straightened with the bandages on the first day; the cause of which is that the limb, when it is large, does not cover that it should rest on the bandages but for a few days or eight or ten, according to your security of the occurrence of cautous abscess.</end>
This is the manner of the dressings with which the Ancients restored them, which were placed over fracture and dislocation and twist.</end_of_turn>
Manner of dressing as is usually opened for the restoration of fractures, convenient for great wounds and mainly for women and men, because of which concerning which no brings heat or cold: and take powder of chaff, which is the pith of wheat that is left over from the grain.
And keep it thus, but if there is any albumin in it, and stop the feeding of it when it is not thick or flexible; and use that.</start_of_turn
Another way to plaster a fracture, dislocation or twist: recipe of asphalt, of lapdanum, of acacia, of enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of marigold, of all one drachmas ten; of myrrh and aloes one drachmas five; aloes one drachmas twenty. All these are triturated and sifted and mixed with water or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this plaster, which is of good composition and restores the broken bones pleasantly, and gives comfort to the patients.</end_of_turn>
Another way to plaster a fracture which gives comfort for fracture and twist: recipe marigold and white chalk one drachmas ten; of myrrh and aloes one drachmas five; of acacia one drachmas six; of linseed one drachmas twenty.</end_of_turn>
All these things are triturated in mortar with oil covering, and are crumbled, and are made comfortable with water or with egg white and are administered.
A way of dressing joints and bones separated from each other in these locations, and where pain occurs in these and at fractures and breaks: take fine wool thread and immerse it in vinegar and oil cooked and place it over the area
Moreover in this dressing there is no virtue of restoration, but of abolition of pain quite properly
Another way of dressing that restores the fracture: take leaves of fig and leaves of poppy seed; mix them all together and make a dressing of them
A short way of dressing that restores the fracture of bones and when you wish to resolve the remaining apostema: mix saffron, chamomile and violets flowers, barley flour, of all things mentioned above They are all triturated and made comfortable with wine, if the limb is not scorched
If it is scorched, then do so with lukewarm water of fennel or with water and use it
Another way of dressing more strong in resolution than the first one, when the apostema is hard to restore the limb: mix saffron and linseed seeds, barley, mellilot, marjoram, violets flowers, chamomile, of all things mentioned above and gum; all these are triturated and made comfortable with vinegar or lukewarm water or wine, according to the quality of the limb and the color of the wound
Ipocras does not say that in the open wound it should be left uncovered that it be covered over the fractured limb until certain healing has taken place; and he recommends that it be more convenient between coarseness and smoothness
It is not seen that in Gaul it is left uncovered that it be covered over the fractured limb until the healing has taken place and the causes of the dry heat such as mirra, sesame and similar things have been mentioned with regard to these causes that we have recommended.
A way of dressing that soothes the lesion and pain: mix beeswax, cinnamon, ground nutmeg or fennel seeds or fennel, and honey, salt, ground gum; they are triturated and crumbled and made comfortable, and make a dressing
The amount according to which it should cover the wound should remain such that it neither causes pain nor discomfort nor does the bone break if it is not fractured in its place. In this case do not remove the dressing for several days And if there is acute pain or swelling or inflammation at the site, in this case you should cover or remove that immediately and leave the dressing on.
Take linen cloth and marine sponge soaked in warm water, and soak that in lukewarm water; and with that wash the area until the swelling and pain cease; and then apply a bandage over the area until an hour has passed; and then put over it fine wool thread immersed in vinegar and oil or olive oil, and cover it with a bandage for one night until you are certain of caut healing, and that the limb is relieved of its swelling, and that the pain is gone
And do it little by little and the dressing is not to be strained for your primary constriction, but to loosen it as it heals.
And if sometimes the apostema and the rigor and the pain and the swelling and all these things have already subsided, and digestion of the dressing and the constriction is not necessary, in this case you should repeat it just as you did at the beginning of the healing process.
And if no other cause appears in the limb of those that we have mentioned, do not remove the dressing until three or four or five or seven days have passed and some say that it should be left covered for about xx days as much as possible until the fracture has adhered, and the blood clot has formed over that
And the time must be adjusted in the major stricture than in your first stricture throughout, and must be adjusted in the swelling of the patient's food, according as the memory of them precedes.
If sometimes the limb of the fracture has already dried and expanded more than before, the time must be understood that the nourishment is prohibited from reaching that; and therefore take that medicine that I have told you to give throughout; and let it be in all three days; and reduce the stricture a little, for by this operation the nourishment will reach the limb and be healed without discomfort.</end_of_turn>
More than those who restore the fracture of the limb, other medicine is given when it is not restored from the beginning as it should be, for it is an error according to the operation of them, and it is a great fear that if they were to continue like this, the veins would grow larger and become engorged with blood.</end_of_turn>
I have never seen anyone who has done this, for it is more reasonable that it does not do any good.</end_of_turn>
Chapter: Of fractures when they happen in the head.</end_of_turn>
The species of fractures are multiple, and their figures are diverse, and their causes are different, for any fracture is caused by the percussion of a space, and the percussion hinders all the bone within the cavity, which is left in place, as it is said to be in the wrist, and because of this this kind is called fracture of the bone; or the space of percussion affects any part of the bone, and affects the marrow of it and does not pass through the back of it; and this kind of fracture is called absolute elevation.</end_of_turn
The cause of these two fractures is either great or little, and of fractures that are contracted or retracted; and their cause is the percussion from soft or hard objects, and from falling from a height.</end_of_turn
This fracture is either penetrating, which approaches the nerve that is left in the bone; or on the face of the bone, and the cause of these two fractures is either great or little.</end_of_turn
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, in the substance of the small vessel, and because of this it is called capillary fracture.</end_of_turn
This is a fracture that is caused by impact or from a fall and from percussion of the bone and from which any layer of the bone enters the parts around it, and it is caused in the hollow part just as when it happens in the palms when it happens from percussion and a part of it enters the surrounding parts.</end_of_turn
And mostly it is caused in the joints of bones that are soft, such as the heads of bones.</end_of_turn
And all these mentioned fractures are like pieces of glass that are separated from each other.</end_of_turn And I saw in this matter a memory of all that is in this place.</end_of_turn
And I know all these kinds of fractures by detection on those and by inquiry of them in order to recognize the rottenness of the marrow that is over them.</end_of_turn
The capillary fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and it is evacuated, and is limited with a bandage, which makes the fracture appear black.</end_of_turn
And in the treatment of fractures, consider at the beginning the signs of the patient's condition, and the time if sometimes for the signs that signify in their manifestation concerning fear, such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of understanding, loss of voice, syncope, high fever, and even the yellowing of the urine and the blackening of the nails, and if these signs are persistent despite all these precautions, it is not healed.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes serious accidents do not appear, you hope for health, the time you begin the treatment of them.</end_of_turn
The cause of which is that if it is carried out at the beginning like that in which it is carried out in the days of spring, the time covers that you study in the bone marrow for thirteen days according to all the precautions.</end_of_turn
And if it is in the summer days, the time covers that you keep the bone marrow exposed for seven days, having to leave the bone rotten from the nerve, and to take precautions for the accidents that we have recommended.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture has already reached the nerve covering the cerebellum, and is contracted into smaller parts and retracted, the time covers that we insert the smaller part and the surrounding tissue, as I have recommended to you.</end_of_turn
And it is that you take the head of the patient who is plagued, and uncover the bone according to custom and handle it as you can according to the figure of the plague, and be curious about the patient.</end_of_turn
If by chance the bone should break, flux of blood or cautery burn, then you must oppose yourself to it as much as you can. Therefore, you must place over the wound cloths soaked in wine and oil, and make the plague rest until the blood flux has ceased; and be certain that the flux of blood has ceased; and then begin the circle of the bone and its ablation.
And thus it is according to two methods of operation.
And one method is that you insert the bone with a straight incision, and this is the form of it: And then you administer another incision, a little wider than the first; and this is the form of it:
And then you administer more incision than the first one wide
And cover that you call by name various incisions, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than the others and are at the back of the acuity of their extremities, and are of iron or steel.
And use them for facilitating percussion over the incision so that you do not break the head and the surrounding tissue
And if the bone is strong and hard, when you administer the incisions give them at the margins, which are called superficial incisions
They are not called thus except that when those are not passing beyond the limit of the bone up to which they reach, for at the superficial incision the extremity is rounded off or margined over that which is left with the head of the bone appearing like a margin or small circle, which must not be immersed and must not pass the thickness of the bone.
It is convenient that you take a great number of these superficial incisions of which each one may be convenient for the thickness of each bone, until in all tests of the cervical the extremity which is acute in length and width is such as to be equal to the quantity of thickness of this test
And this is the form of three species of incisions: The quality of perforating in the circuit of the fractured bone is that you stop the incision on the bone and rotate that with the nails mentioned until you know that the bone has already been penetrated; and then change the incision to another place and stop that which is between all the amount of the thickness of the ray or remove it altogether
And thus you will make incisions with the incisions that are between each break of the bone, and you will make that more subtle than you could over that in order to lift it up, as we have said, until you have eradicated the bone, or with your hand, or by any other cause for some other discomfort which may appear to it, such as nails and fine forceps.
And you must take care that the incision does not touch any cause of contamination
And when you have completed the circuit of the bone, if it is separated from the contamination if it is continued with it, then you must extract it, taking care that you scrape and wipe away that which is on the surface of it like an incision, more especially because it is more tough and subtle than the others.
And if any small parts of the bones and fragments remain, when you have finished with them, take care of those with water so that it is because of the discomfort; and then care for the wound with lint and bandage as we have said
And the other method of operation is lighter, long and laborious, which is that of dissecting the ankle and the heel for great relief; and this is its name: It is necessary for you at the beginning to begin to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is the most violent and obvious, until when you have discovered that part and have stopped leaving the extremity of that incision relaxed and calm, this is the form:
And that the blunt part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is of it in two directions frontally and longitudinally, as sometimes; and that the blunt part is adjusted to the contamination with the face of the acute incision on the bone.
And thus you will perforate over the incision with a little hammer until you have penetrated all the bone easily as if it were rotated, and you must be certain that the nail will not happen to you accidentally, and if the physician was the most learned of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was sleeping.
And if there remains any attached cause to the bone in various places of the bone, incision that one of them with the extremity of the incision that is blunt, and drain that one with the greatest ease, which is drained of it spontaneously without any document or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the contamination, and that which is broken or remaining of the bone is on the face of it, and remains in the surface and fine fragments, then you must care that you scrape away that surface and eradicate those fine fragments with fine instruments as you have prepared them in various quantities so that you can manage to administer them in all places with the greatest convenience and the greatest safety of those according to what you have lost in your operation that fractured bone and the figure of it
And thus you must administer at your ratio with which you began, the same amount of the same things, and immediately use up the rest of the dose, and do not cease until you have administered the dose and the rest of the things.
Moreover, in any other small fracture or superficial fracture, cover that you administer care according to what you have lost in order to rectify it
And it is because you have not learned anything about it in that art. And we have shown in large fractures what we have written about
And if the swelling is rectangular when you extract it from him, then cover that you take a sponge of lint according to the quantity of the wound, and soak that in oil of ravens, and place that over the opening of the wound; and take another sponge folded or tripled and soak that in wine and oil of ravens and place that over the first sponge and apply pressure to the wound gently so that it does not burst; and then administer over that lint oil, and do not tighten that until the wound is as wide alone.
And leave that until this care has passed for a day or two until you are sure of its cessation; and then remove that and immediately administer medicines which are useful for drying, such as flaxseed and oatmeal, and poppyseed and rue, and like those.</start_of_turn>
And that you grind these medicines into powder that it be scattered over the wound, as they are dry; and universally, administer any medicine that has the property of drying and not biting.</start_of_turn>
And take care that the wound in your care be smooth; and do not put anything greasy on it or anything else; nor do you leave anything to increase the virulence of it; for when it is applied to the swelling of the brain, it corrupts that and brings it low, and causes great harm to the patient.</start_of_turn
And take care that the swelling of the head, as when it is solidified the bone and more when the care is less, is black in the surface; and therefore consider that if you cause injury to the patient in this way, the accidents that we have said are dangerous are likely to occur, since it is perilous to do so.</start_of_turn
And if you do not cause blackening except for the medicine that is stopped from it, and it is in virtue of that medicine that causes that blackness, then cover that you take a little more of the medicine and a little more of oil of ravens three parts.</start_of_turn and mix with those lines a sponge, and place that over the swelling; and take care of that which convenes for the species of treatment that you think will make it well.</start_of_turn
Chapter III.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
Know that the nose is not fractured but rather split into two parts so that there are two bones, for the split part is cartilaginous and is not fractured and does not cause pain, but only swelling and torment and sleeplessness.</start_of_turn
And if one of the two parts is fractured, then cover that you make an incision little by little in the seam of the nose, and that you bind that fracture with the thumb and index finger, and with the little finger, until the nose returns to its natural shape.</start_of_turn And do this for your convenience, and take care that you do not cause him any pain during this operation.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and you say that it is not severe, then cover that it should be equal to the extremity of the ray in which it is small.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is in two parts, do this for him as well.</start_of_turn
Cover that you restore him on the first day of the fracture if possible; and if not, then leave him for six days or until he has recovered from the cessation of the pain.</start_of_turn
And immediately apply to the extremity of the nose a a sponge of lint, if the fracture is in one part, or two cushions, if the fracture is in two parts, and the thickness of the cushion should be such that it fills the hole of the nose.</start_of_turn
And tell the old restorers that the cushions should be bound over, and should be changed throughout the day, even though I do not see it; because it has been covered that the sponge should be bound with moist album of flour with powdered gypsum; and like that keep the cartilage fixed and make it endure.</start_of_turn
Each eye blinks both inwards and outwards, instead of outwards only, because of the thick mucus that covers the eyelids; and either the nose is fractured or the patient is not allowed to breathe.
This cause is not necessary for you; if you wish, do this, if you wish, do that.</end_of_turn>
And if the eye happens to bleed afterwards, cover the eye with lead or with mustard poultice or with vinegar and olive oil, or with alum.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if it does not bleed afterwards, cover the eye with flour and powdered charcoal with an egg white of a fowl; and place your hand over the eye to prevent it from moving.
Maybe if the bones of the nose are fractured slightly or broken, cover those and extract those with instruments that are suitable for those; and close the wound, and care for that which has been excoriated and consolidated, and apply what is convenient.</end_of_turn>
And if there is a wound on the face of the nose, cover that with gloves and give lead enemas until it is completely healed.</end_of_turn>

Restoration of the mandible when fractured.</end_of_turn>
When the mandible is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, it is necessary to determine if the fracture is displaced only or if it is fractured in two and bent outwards. In the latter case, awareness is impaired.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the middle finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and in the same way, if the fracture is on the left mandible, insert the middle finger of the right hand; and with your left hand support the prominence of the fracture outwards as much as possible, so that the fracture can be reduced in the most convenient way.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the mandible has already separated into two, cover that you administer extension of two parts according to rectitude until it is possible to equalize them.</end_of_turn
And if there is displacement of teeth with disruption, cover those which you expect to remain in place with gold or silver or ivory; and place your hand over the fractured mandible firmly, and place your hand over the bone flap, and place your hand over the great nerve suitably far away; and tie that which is loosened according to what is indicated by the ligature and convenient for you, until it is not destroyed.</end_of_turn
Command the patient to rest and tranquility, and suspend their diet of strong foods.</end_of_turn
And if you see that the shape has already been altered in any way, cover that and remove it on the third day; and rectify what has already been altered of it and apply powder of charcoal, egg white or flour, because you have already taken away all the rest from it, and place your hand over the dressing.</end_of_turn
And when it is fixed and adjusted that dressing over it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, leave that for three months. Because if you remove it before that, the fracture will be stretched in three parts.</end_of_turn
And if another wound happens afterwards, cover that as well as has been said in the calm of the patient until it is healed, and remove that wound.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, consider if it is a broken bone or a displacement of the fragments, and in this case you should order that those fragments be repositioned with what is convenient for the removal of those that cause pain.</end_of_turn
And if the wound is wide, cover that by making a flank incision according to the amount of your need.</end_of_turn
And when you have finished repositioning those fragments, and of those which you have not removed, cover the wound if it is wide; or if not, place one of the dressings which you consider convenient over that and hold that in place until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Restoration of the thyroid when fractured.</end_of_turn
A fracture of the thyroid is caused by a downward displacement of the thyroid cartilage from the muscle of the neck, and that fracture can be caused in three ways.</end_of_turn
Because it is fractured, displaced or separated into two parts without causing displacement; and it is necessary to restore it; or because it is accompanied by displacement, and restoration is difficult; or because the fracture is accompanied by a wound.</end_of_turn
The operation in this case, when the fracture is displaced, is that two assistants are to be present. One should hold the fractured bone steady, and the other should extend the limb beyond that part.
Then wrap the fracture around the thighs as much as necessary so that its shape is restored to its normal state, without excessive tension or concavity.</end_of_turn>
If further extension is required, then keep your hand still over the patient’s thigh and support the fracture with the thumb or index finger; let the size of your support be according to the degree of your need. Extend and elevate the limb and cover the fracture with your hand until it is properly immobilized.</end_of_turn
If you are unable to draw out the limb from the fracture site, because it is already displaced, then let the patient rest on their chest, and place a cushion under their muscles, one hand of which should be of greater size.</end_of_turn>
The assistants should support the limb under the muscles until the fractured bone is elevated above the fracture site. Then you should rectify the fracture and wrap it around the thighs once more.</end_of_turn>
If the limb hangs limp and the fracture is unstable, then you must take hold of it and gently extract the fragments with ease.</end_of_turn>
If the bone is firmly fixed, then make an incision of the limb with one of the instruments that you have prepared, since you have already stopped the fracture from causing further damage. The damage is of a fist or knife kind.</end_of_turn
It is like a wound of the kind mentioned above; let the size of the incision be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or the looseness of the surrounding area.</end_of_turn
Let the length of the incision be as much as is possible for the operation; two extremities should be present as often as possible, one broad and one narrow.</end_of_turn>
If the disruption of the tissue that you have incised when you extracted the fragment from the bone is wide, and you are sure that the edges will not adhere, then you should suture together the two edges of the wound.</end_of_turn
If the disruption is slight, or if you fear excessive bleeding, then you should cover the wound with a bandage and powder according to the size of the wound.</end_of_turn
If bleeding occurs, fill the wound with wine vinegar and olive oil, and leave it on the wound.</end_of_turn
All of this, however, should not make the splint flexible over the fractured bone. Therefore, you must make sure that the patient is examined every day to see if the limb is healing. When the ligament is softened or the splint is already softened, then you must rectify the fracture and tighten the bandage.</end_of_turn>
Keep the patient’s limb still on the bed and make sure that their hand is placed under the limb during the night, so that the fracture is supported by the limb itself or by the chest muscle.</end_of_turn
Do not remove the bandage if no bleeding or excessive swelling occurs, until at least twelve days have passed.</end_of_turn
Replace the plaster cast if you see the edge of the wound again. Realign the fracture and maintain the reduction until the fracture is properly stabilized and the bone is healed.</end_of_turn
The limb should be strengthened and comforted for 88 days, and some patients recover in a house in two months.</end_of_turn>
The end.
Healing of ankle fracture.
The ankle bone is fractured at the lateral side and not at the middle of the bone.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when the limb is fractured — and it is fractured in the middle of the limb — and is not recognized except by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture it will prepare you for the treatment and reduce it in such a way as to achieve the natural shape of the limb in every possible way.
Then place your hand over the powdered area of the limb with an albumin of flour and stop the bleeding; and do the same with a swab of doubled gauze; and do the same with a spatula as much as a spatula or a little more.</end_of_turn>
Moreover, if the spatula leaves the mark concave in some parts of the limb, then you must fill that concavity with flour and stop the bleeding, and then put the spatula back according to equality.</end_of_turn>
Then strengthen the dressing with a long bandage with downward tension and a firm support of the limb until it is not slippery from the wound.</end_of_turn
Consider the ligament in every day; and whenever it is softened, put on another bandage and tighten it equally with the limb if it is slippery from the wound.</end_of_turn
I hold the patient over the bedside table like this.</end_of_turn>
The spatula is restored in xx days or in .xxv.</end_of_turn>
And when this number is completed, then you will dissolve the ligament and you will know with certainty that what was begun will not be feared or dissolved from the bones from which it began.</end_of_turn>
If you proceed from the ankle bone and leave the tendon behind, then you will split it open, hold it in place, and do as we have said concerning the fracture of the collarbone of the scapula after excision of the callous if it happens here.</end_of_turn

On the restoration of the fracture of the foot.</end_of_turn
The limb has several veins that are broken in the middle of the limb and which are there; but the extremities of the limb must not be injured because they must be cicatrized and diminished.</end_of_turn
And concerning the accidents of the limb when the middle is fractured, it is that it declines to the joints and causes great pain, and difficulty in walking, and vomiting and fainting; and is declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and is not hidden from the feeling.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of the limb is that you rest the patient on both sides, and place between the spaces of the limb a cushion; and you will press on the muscles of the limb, and adjust the ribs of the limb to the greatest of two sides, and support the limb in the operation and in the equilibrium as much as is possible and as is convenient, until you restore the figure of the bone as it covers.</end_of_turn
Then place your hand over the plaster and stop, and put on a spatula of gauze or cloth and keep it suspended; because you will encase it in flour; and keep the limb covered so that it is not exposed; and keep the limb bound according to the swelling of every vein, and tighten that which is strict downward; and consider the ligament in every hour, and whenever it is softened tighten that again.</end_of_turn
And if necessary you will cause the loosening of that which must be corrected for corrosion or bruising, or pain, or swelling that occurs in the limb, then you will cover it and remove that and remove the plaster and rectify what has happened for what is convenient for the care of the limb; and then you will reduce the plaster, sometimes up to the face; and adjust the stricture so that it is healthy.</end_of_turn

On the restoration of the vertebrae when they are fractured.</end>
You must know that the fracture of the vertebrae does not cause pain only in the places where it is located but also in those which are opposite; and from the extremities of the part from which it comes it does not cause anything except for what is cartilaginous.</end_of_turn And you must know that it is not hidden from the feeling that the pain must be inquired about.</end_of_turn
And the restoration must be such that it embraces the fracture as we have said according to the possibility, except that it must be embraced as much as it covers, and then you will plaster it and tighten the fractured bone with a spatula, if you deem it necessary of that.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the vertebrae is declining to the joints downwards, then it causes to the patient acute pain and puncture, just as if there were a puncture of that which has pleuracy, and for that reason the bone has its velocity; and it causes difficulty in walking, and vomiting and fainting which is of great difficulty to cure.</end_of_turn
E ja les Antixs so engeniatz en aquela am motz engientz.
And so they say: cover that which causes the patient's vomiting that brings about inflammation and windiness, so that the belly becomes inflated and extended, and the fracture is impeded in the outer parts
May we beware of that lest it should cause excessive bleeding, if it does not happen; and if it has already happened, then it is already helpful in that case
And some of them say that it should be calmed down from its violent wind; and it is like an argument, however, we must fear lest the wind should tear away the humors at the site of the wound
And some of them say: cover the area with a cloth that is already submerged in warm oil, and sprinkle powder between the ribs until it is full; let the ligature be gentle when you wrap around that second circumference; and do apply healing to the patient with the care of food and medicine
And if it causes violent constriction of the patient which does not suffer, and if you see that the wound is inflamed, then fear for the patient; for when you open up the wound, uncover the broken edge, and do place your hand over that instrument that holds the intestines in place, remembering that which comes before is more important, and that they cause the bones to soften, and extract that.
And so we must adjust the two edges of the wound, if it is great, with stitching, and we should care for that with dressings until it is healed
And if it happens that there is bleeding, then cover and soak up the powder in warm oil and place your hand over the area, and let the patient be healed by that which covers the bleeding.</start_of_turn>

Of the restoration of the fracture of the spine of the two and of the heel.</start_of_turn
In some cases there are fractures of the bones of the heel, and the same with the vertebrae of the spine.</start_of_turn And when this happens to some of them and you want to know if it is well or not, then consider, for sometimes the greatest limbs are already softened and stupefied and dead, and you cannot make them move or extend or bend them, and when you compress them with your hands they say that it is not well; and in such a case death is imminent.</start_of_turn
And if you do that and touch them with your hands and puncture them, then you must know that the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with care.</start_of_turn
And if you see the vertebrae of the heel like that and you want to know if they are well or not, then consider the feet.</start_of_turn
Sometimes indeed when they are already softened, it happens that it is impossible to make them walk or to defecate voluntarily, and many people sleep on their side and are unable to urinate, and you must know that this is fatal, and do not work on their care.</start_of_turn
And if no other cause is found for this, the cause is better and lighter.</start_of_turn
And the care of them is to perforate with a pointed cautery at the site of the broken bone and apply warm oil or moist sponges to it; put your hand over that so that any bleeding stops that may occur.
And do remove one of the soft dressings and leave the existing one, and bind tightly about that which is limated; and command the patient to rest and be tranquil and not to sleep on the side on which he experiences pain until he is well.</start_of_turn
And if it happens that the bone is displaced by a fracture or any other cause that has already separated from it, then you must cover the wound and hold that bone in place; and do adjust the two edges of the wound, with stitching if necessary; and do care for that with some ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the heel bone is fractured and this is the end of the limb, then you must put your left hand on the buttock and grasp the fractured bone with your right hand as much as possible; and do hold the fracture in place with a bandage, if necessary; and do put on the dressing and plaster, if necessary, and bind tightly.</start_of_turn
And if you sit with fractures of the heel bone in this way, then you must leave that alone, and stay with it, and care for the wound with the care that is customary until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Capitol X.
Capital X. - Restoration of the limb.
The bones of the thighs are broken, and if they break, the pain of the fracture is not simply in the extremities but is spread throughout their length and declines towards the lower parts; and this causes pain in the groin and puncture, and the limb is stupefacted when there is a fracture
And the restoration of the limb is that you extend your hand over that which is above the fracture which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is at the end of the limb alone, then you embrace that part as if it were covered with an equal part until it is reunited to its natural shape
Even if the fracture is in the middle or that it declines towards the lower parts, then you must make the patient lie down on his belly until he is prepared for the restoration of the fracture. And therefore when you have reunited that, place over it a compress, and then place over that the bandage of gauze or linen, and strengthen by tightening over the area where you do not fear puncture of the fracture or loosening of the splinter
And embrace the cavity with that which fills that which previously supported the tightening according to equality, and command the patient to lie down on his side or to sleep on his side towards the chest
But if after the cautery the limb still swells, then you must stop the extension and restoration until the swelling of the cautery has subsided, and place over it that which is before mentioned that is previously mentioned; and then return to the restoration of the limb, and strengthen that as before.
And if it happens in the hip bones or are broken, then you must break them off.</start_of_turn>
Capital XI. - Fractures of the hip bones or thigh bones.</start_of_turn>
Restoration of the fracture of the adductor muscle.</start_of_turn
The adductor is that which is between the groin and the head of the femur.</start_of_turn
And if it is broken, the restoration of it is in two ways, of which one is to grasp the thigh with a grip of medium thickness according to this shape:
And with two ligaments placed in two extremities and the limb suspended from the elevated area.
And keep the patient on a seat; and then bring out the limb with the broken bone over the thigh until it reaches the navel of the limb where the curvature of the thigh is attached
And if there is any serious cause or if the limb extends to the lower parts, or if the physician wants to make the fracture firm in the groin, then he should keep the fracture fixed as much as possible until the fracture returns as before
And the other method is that the patient should lie on his chest and suspend the limb from the hip joint by a ligament; and command two assistants that one of them hold that which is below the fracture at its most; and the other hold the legs; and neither of them should extend to their part
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then you must strengthen over the fracture with a ligament and over that with another ligament, and neither of the two assistants should extend their parts.
And therefore if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then you must hold that half of the ligament over the navel and the other over the fracture beyond the groin
Similarly if the fracture is near the groin, then you must hold the ligament over that place and over the groin itself
Embrace that which facilitates and helps, and when it has been reunited as much as is possible according to the cover and is applied correctly, then strengthen that which is not causing a post-cautery swelling
But if there is still a post-cautery swelling after the cautery, then leave the tightening for seven days, and place over it a soaked bandage of wool and oil until the swelling has subsided, and then strengthen that once more
And the way to strengthen that is to place a compress over the fracture, and then place a layer of gauze around the compress; and then adjust the arm over that adductor, and put your hand over the muscle of the thigh.
And keep the limb still and strengthen over the adductor the arm so that the arm is in place without hindering anything related to the broken bone
And use crutches.
The fractured bone should rest upon the most sturdy and strong of the surrounding bones. And between each bone, leave the width of a finger, and the length of the bones according to the fracture, plus three fingers from end to end.
And keep your hand firm over the bones at the stricture which I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And let your stricture over the area of the fracture be as straight as possible And when the fracture is long, make the stricture smaller
And thus, if sometimes the situation of the bones and the stricture are as we have said when you restore the limb to its natural position, then you have done well
And if you fear aftercare from the cautery, then leave the stricture and the bones inside for seven days as we have said before
And consider the ligament in all its parts for three days so that it does not become inflamed in the place of the fracture; or it is prohibited to eat to preserve the limb due to excessive stricture; and thus rectify all that we have said
May be if you are confident that no harmful cause will arise from this, then do not remove the ligature until three days have passed or more
And let your sleep in the patient's room be two, and the patient's hands be over the stomach.
And keep your attendants warm with wool covering, and consider throughout the night or day that the fractured limb is not deformed or softened, or that the ligament is relaxed, therefore rectify all this with your skill.
And keep the patient's diet according to the order we have given previously, except that the diet be mild in the beginning until it is strengthened; and the hand that gives the food must cover that the patient does not vomit
Concerning the use of the attendants and the change of position, it is necessary to strengthen them in forty days; and let them be loosened and give baths, and be medicated with those that rectify this
And if the fracture is delayed, do not remove the ligature until the eleventh day or two months have passed
Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
On the restoration of the fracture of the arm.
The arm consists of two bones which are called the ulna and the radius; of which the one is small, which is that which follows the thumb, and the other is great, which is that which is placed beyond the thumb from the little finger side
And it is strong that only the greater bone is fractured, or only the small one, or both are fractured together
And when the small bone is fractured outwards, the restoration of the limb is lighter, and the healing is easier
And when the greater bone is fractured beyond the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
And the worse of all is when both bones are fractured together
Therefore, if the bone that is fractured is the small one outwards, it is convenient for the doctor to postpone the restoration, which should take place with little extension until that one is healed
However, if the greater bone is fractured, it must be kept still more strongly
And if both bones are fractured together, you must keep the limb still even more strongly
And you must keep the limb still with the hand supported by cushions, so that all the fingers are extended beyond the others, and the thumb is lower than the other fingers, and the patient is sitting on a cushion
And provide a cushion under the limb or on the sides of the limb, so that the patient does not strain to work
And let the attendants extend the arm from the side further from the body with the palm of the hand facing inwards or towards the ligament, and another attendant should extend the same in a similar way
And let the doctor reduce the bone until it returns to its natural position according to the best figure that can be obtained
And if in the fracture of the bone there is swelling, let him pierce the whole limb in the place with your skill
And if there appears a separated swelling that you do not hope will heal, let you give up on it and keep it according to the method we have mentioned before
May be if the fracture is obvious, I have already made a single incision, and therefore take care of that.
And if during the course of your restoration, the cautery accidentally slips at the beginning, then you line up a layer of fat with olive oil and white wax, and mix some sponge-powder with sponge-grit, and strengthen the fat over that stricture until the cautery is loosened; then remove the fat and pause the dressing prepared from powdered charcoal with white lead, and place your hand over that area; and make the mark which is placed over that fracture more firm and strong.</end_of_turn>
And you know that the number of bones in the arm is seen in the greater arrangements, or that the fracture is in a single bone or in two bones together.</end_of_turn>
Then pause your stricture over the area of the fracture more firmly and more urgently, and when more than likely the fracture has gone beyond the upper parts of the fracture or to the lower parts of them, pause the stricture a little more moist according to the memory of the extent of the fracture at the beginning.</end_of_turn
And the cloths that cover the fracture should be moist cloths, not dry or rough, and the thread with which it is tied should be neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have recommended.</end_of_turn
Consider the limb and the ligament for a few days.</end_turn> And if any cause arises that necessitates rectification, as for example what happens to the limb, then cover that the limb with cold water until the cause of the problem disappears.</end_turn
And keep the limb still until it has healed, and then remove the stricture.</end_turn
And if the swelling has already subsided and the bone is already reunited and appears like that, then rectify everything with your art.</end_turn
And consider also if the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the limb because of the stricture, because you should cover that for a few days until it returns to that which gives nourishment, and strengthen that.</end_turn
And if no other cause of those we have mentioned occurs in the patient, then do not leave it plastered for more than xx days or thereabouts.</end_turn
And do not let the patient keep their hand on the patient for their agitative movement, but make them sleep on two chairs.</end_turn
You know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or that the convalescence is completed in xxviii days, according to the condition of the complications and the disposition of the art.</end_turn

On the restoration of fractures of the thumb and the fingers.</end_turn
You know that in the thumb and the fingers there is a break of the bone, and it does not happen to them except for the presence of soft swellings.</end_turn
And when there is a fracture or tearing of the hand, then the patient must keep their hand resting and still, following the direction of the physician, and place their hand over that which is extended.</end_turn
Then the minister extends the broken bones and the physician mends them until they are reunited with good congruence.</end_turn
Then pause the dressing and the bandage, if not the cautery; and pause the mark according to the amount of the area, and you have already covered that with fat.</end_turn
And if the fracture is in the proximal parts you must hold the wrist of the palm, and keep the palm still, and command the patient to strengthen that which has been fractured in the palm; strengthen it with oil long.</end_turn
And the bone which is floating in the fat should be supported by the palm; strengthen that as well.</end_turn
And if the fracture is in the distal parts, then pause the mark above the thumb and the other mark of the lower part of the palm, so that the hand is open and closed; and pause the stricture, even if the hand is rotated from the metacarpal bones to the thumb.</end_turn
And if there is a fracture of one of the bones of the fingers, if it is said to be loose, then engage it as it should be and strengthen it with the palm of the hand and if you wish, support the small bone of the thumb so that the fracture is elevated and not bruised.</end_turn
And if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle, index, ring or small finger, then engage it and bind it with the thumb as much as possible; or bind them all together as a whole; or support that little bone as we have said before.</end_turn
Consider, in your restoration, and indeed that, the arrangement of aftercare cautery opposes — alongside the present operation — whatever covers whenever any cause of those may arise, as it is iterated in the narration.

On the restoration of a fractured bone of the thigh.</end_of_turn>
The thigh bone being broken and the surrounding skin moved is declared as sensitive as when converted to the neighbouring part and the surrounding pus.</end_of_turn
And the restoration is made in such a way that the ligament is stretched over the fracture and another ligament leaves the fracture, and the patient lies with the abdomen on the seat and the face down.</end_of_turn
And indeed the minister extends all the ligament to its part according to the quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</end_of_turn
May be if it is close to the thigh, however, the ligament is stretched to the nail at the end of the bone, in order that the extension should be in its entirety, and the other ligament leaves the fracture.</end_of_turn
Similarly if the fracture is close to the nail, indeed the ligament is stretched to the nail, and the extension is to the parts beyond.</end_of_turn
And indeed the doctor grasps the bone on both sides more than enough to reduce that which must be reduced according to the natural semblance; the bone is joined by a good junction; however, cover that the plaster and the bandage are removed, if no other accident has occurred to the limb aftercare.</end_of_turn However, if an accident occurs in the aftercare, indeed you leave that for a few days until the aftercare caut has softened, and then you return to your care.</end_of_turn
The bandage is also firmly fixed: cover that you wrap around the fracture a hard bandage, and bend that two or three times, and press down on its superfluidity; and indeed cover the limb up to the hip and the thigh.</end_of_turn
And indeed long thread firmly between the thigh and the limb near the nail, and comes out from the parts beyond the nail of the parts beyond the two parts, and indeed you roll over the limb and the thigh as much as the bandage surpasses.</end_of_turn
And indeed you stay over the thigh in the place of that fracture astillah, and you stay of those a staple on the bone of the limb.</end_of_turn
And indeed you fill the cavities between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, in order to coagulate the constriction.</end_of_turn
And indeed you start firmly from the middle over the place of the fracture with three coverings or four, and when you have gone as far as you can over the ligament of the place of the fracture, your constriction is less and lighter and softer.</end_of_turn
And indeed extend two ends of the thread to the parts beyond until it reaches the ankle, and tighten both ends of the staples of the other part so that the ligament is not stretched from the place.</end>
And indeed keep the bandage on that way, so that no other accident occurs to the limb, neither aftercare caut nor swelling and that it remains as it should be; and if any of those things occur, then you must immediately loosen that and rectify what has occurred as soon as possible, as we have said above.</end>
However, if on the bone there is pain of the bone which we put in, indeed you must loosen that as much as you can; and if not, leave it off and take care of what precedes it until it is healed.</end>
And indeed every bandage is strengthened this fracture of the thigh in another way than the staples, as we have said in the adjunct and in the arms.</end
However, indeed in the restoration of it in this way it does not cause pain to the patient; and if it is restored alone, another thing that is applied to the other limb, it is necessary that you clamp that from which you start.</end

You know that in the thigh bone there are two bones of which one is thick, and it is called the femur; and the other is thin, and it is called the fibula.</end_of_turn
And it happens in some cases of fracture that both bones of the limb are fractured, and for that reason the restoration of them is as soon as possible as the restoration of the limb itself, and the operation is one.</end_of_turn
And if both bones are fractured together, the thigh bone is converted to all parts.</end_of_turn
And if only the thin bone is fractured, the thigh bone is converted to the proximal parts.</end_of_turn
And if only the thick bone is fractured, you must leave it like that, and that is from these causes that you do not know.</end_of_turn
And immediately administer extension and equalization and ligation of the fragments according to that healing.</end_of_turn
However, if the fracture of the thigh bone is slight without having great displacement, that the extension should be gentle and lighter, and relieve with your ability.</end_of_turn
And in the thigh bone is any cause of operation on the limb, and that is when you have healed the fragments and when you have completed all the work of the operation, then you will take a piece of soft lead from the palms of your hands which is held back for these causes, and you will make it equal to the length of the thigh bone and from the hip to the knee.
And immediately cover over any wound with two coverings according to their length, and suspend one over the part of the thigh bone from one side and the other from the other side, and they should reach from the hip to the knee joint.</end_of_turn
And immediately bind the two fragments in three places at the two extremities and in the middle part, so that this structure of the thigh bone is prohibited from leaning to the right and left, and it remains in a good position.</end_of_turn
And immediately an ointment of soft lead has been administered according to the length of the thigh bone; and keep the thigh bone still in it so that it conserves that movement.</end_of_turn
And more than anything else cover that which is in fracture, and when that is properly wounded.</end_of_turn
And consider every day the thigh bone and study it in order to determine when it is healed, and you will keep it away from apostemal cautery and from inflammation or from any other cause resembling that; and when any of these causes occurs, then immediately suspend it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</end_of_turn
Of the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and the toes.</end_of_turn
The ankle bone does not often fracture; however, some fractures occur in the bones of the foot; and in the toes fractures are rare, and do not occur except in the case of great displacement.</end_of_turn
And if there is a fracture in the bones of the foot and sometimes those bones must be elevated between them, then you must place their foot on the prepared earth like when going.</end_of_turn
And immediately suspend one foot over that which is elevated from those bones, and immediately apply plaster to them, and press, and heal those until they return to their places.</end_of_turn
And immediately suspend the bandage and stop displacement, and suspend the belly of the foot a little higher than the two heads of the plaster.</end_of_turn
The pain caused by cold humors that infiltrate every part of the body, and when it occurs in the feet, is usually called gout by physicians.
When three or four days have passed, then you should loosen the ligaments, for you will find the bones swollen, fractured or dislocated, and in such a case the operation is like that of a leech.
But if they say that they are fractured, then restore them and bind them just as you bound the hand and order the restoration of the fingers of the hand And now stop the fractured finger star according to the length of the finger; and if necessary, leave a little space between them. And put on the bandage that I have recommended, and strengthen that part of the foot that is stiff downwards.
But if two or three bones are fractured, then stop over every fractured finger that is enveloped in a thick cloth, strengthen the bandage at the bottom of the foot, and hold one of the ends of the bandage firmly against the patient's belly so that it has good retention
And it is convenient for you to know that you must not neglect all the causes that we have mentioned regarding other fractures of the same accidents; and take care of any other accident that may occur to you
Chapter XVIII.</end_turn>
Of the fracture of the knee of the femur and of the patella and of the cuboid bone of the ankle.</end_turn>
When the knee of the femur is fractured, then cease in the middle of the wound and incline that to the side a little, and keep it long from behind.</end_turn
And put on the cushion and fill the knee with cotton, and make an incision in the knee as expected; and elevate the two small bones little by little, until everything that is outside is gone until the fractured part is as expected and the fractured bone returns.</end_turn
And keep powders on the two sides, and when you want to urinate, it will be easier for you to empty your bladder; and reduce and return that according to the manner in which you wished at the beginning, and then return the powder first.</end_turn
And do thus for seven days or until it is restored.</end_turn
And if you wish, take once a vessel of vinegar and strengthen over the heel of the foot a tube of gutta; and empty all the bladder into the knee of the foot, and immediately after that stop up the tube with cotton until the bladder is full within the knee, because the fracture returns.</end_turn
And keep the knee filled with cotton and rest for about eight days as we have recommended, until it is healed.</end_turn
And when the patella of the knee or the bone of the thigh is fractured, then administer in the restoration and elevation of the limb what we have recommended for the ankle bone.</end_turn
And what is fractured is not hidden in these primary fractures and that little pain, mostly to the one to whom this book is addressed; for that fracture means to you in the greatest ability for recovery and strengthening of the limb.</end_turn
But as for the fracture of the cuboid bone of the ankle, when it is fractured, take a bandage of silk and put the ankle in that; and immediately after that stop up the wound with the dressing, and keep it covered, and keep it still for three days or until it is healed.</end_turn
Chapter XIX.</end_turn
Of the restoration of the fracture of the bones when it is surrounded by pus.</end_turn
It is convenient in that case in which the fracture occurred with pus, and especially if the bone is large as the thigh bone or the patella, or is similar to that, that you take care of it and keep it still as much as possible, even if the conditions of phlebitis are present as we have mentioned.</end_turn
And if the pus flows out healed, then cover that you keep the limb still in the place in which you powdered it, if for another reason it is not present.</end_turn
And start to restore the fracture in that middle day, and do not prolong it, if it does not occur afterwards.</end_turn
But if it occurs anew after a few days, then leave the restoration of the limb until the apostemas have disappeared, and do not approach it on the third day and the fourth of every month, because you will cause other accidents.</end_turn
May it be that if the pain persists despite the opening of the coccyx, know that you must perforate to reduce and soothe that which is causing you the most pain with the least amount of extension.
If the extension does not suffice and the pain is located in the buttocks more than in the thighs, know that you must reduce that which is causing you the most pain with this instrument; for this is the instrument of force, the length of which is seven or eight inches and the width according to the quantity of the disease; and for this reason the physician must take into consideration three or four according to the quantity that he judges necessary for the cure in all kinds of fracture.</end_of_turn>
And be round, and be in little breadth so that it is not doubled over during the operation.</end_of_turn>
And be of acute extremity to which be margin in the limbs; and be its dressing of great extent, and of the middle part enter the parts.</end_of_turn
This is the way to do it:
It is called in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, so it is little pale.</end_of_turn>
For that it must be suspended the acute extremity elevated over the prominent extremity of the bone.</end_of_turn
And place it in a groove until the bone returns, and be soothed with any equalization.</end_of_turn
And therefore endeavor to soothe the fractures between them, and if the fractured extremity is subtle, and does not bring that discomfort, know that you must insert the extremity of that bone until the instrument has power over what.
If you cannot reduce the bone entirely as we have recommended, know that you must cut away that which covers them from the dissectors which we have said; or saw that with one of the saws in whatever way you can.
Then remove that which remains in the bone of asperity and small scales.</end_of_turn>
When the bone is reduced, and the patient finds violent pain again, know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to comfort the patient greatly.</end_of_turn>
When the restoration of the limb is complete, which you have made to the bone, and when you have submerged the limb in black vinegar, and properly if it is summer, and do not place over the wound grease or anything else which may cause it to become infected or corrupted.</end_of_turn
And immediately administer sponges at the time of the meal complementary to the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered until it has healed, because you must insert the fracture with forceps and use bandages according to the quantity of the wound.</end_of_turn
Beware that you do not strain the wound at the fracture, for many veined women have done what good doctors have said, and it is dangerous to do so with sick or dying patients or those with rotting or putrefying wounds, so be careful.</end_of_turn And if the limb stiffness be slight, soft, different from the stiffness of other fractures.</end>
If the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear concerning that limb the accidents which we have recommended, and you find pain in the place, know that you must not place over that bandage, but rather do that bandage of cloth over it.</end_of_turn
And when a few days have passed since the wound has begun to heal, that there should be generated in it a brace, know that you must remove the bandage which you had placed over that with vinegar, and immediately administer calamine, as is our custom in healing wounds, thus as well as tetracycline and similar medications.</end_of_turn>
And remind you that you must remove the dressing and consider the wound every day morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and that the limb is prepared in such a way that the infection will run away from it to the parts beyond with ease.</end_of_turn
If several days have passed since the wound has healed, and it is neither consolidated nor has it been excised from the limb, know that here is the setting of the small things so that you can inquire about the wound again.</end_of_turn And those that are separated remain outside and extract, those that do not depart remain in the limb and cause pain, pierce to insert them as you are able.</end_of_turn
If the wound is black or swollen, it is a sign of gangrene, or some other species of corruption and putrefaction, know that you must suspend the treatment which precedes this narration in the capital city.</end_of_turn>
When you perceive that the pain you are treating is not diminishing despite the application of all known remedies and the patient's general condition is such that it is not possible to perform further treatment, then you should leave the case and allow nature to take its course. If you observe that the patient's condition improves, then do not prolong treatment; otherwise, leave the case untouched.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 20.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of swelling which occurs in the aftermath of any fracture.</end_of_turn>
These swellings often arise in the vicinity of fracture healing, more so in the joints, and are often caused by the body's natural healing process itself.</end_of_turn
If the swelling is recent, administer medicines which have a constrictive effect thus as aloe, fennel, rue, chamomile, and similar; take some of these or all of them, and mix them with vinegar or alum, or with oil of rosemary, and apply this mixture to the swelling to stop the swelling and tighten the tissues around it.</end_of_turn
Leave the extraction of such swelling until the inflammation has subsided; then remove it again, repeating this process until the swelling has disappeared; or strengthen the lamina of lead downwards, as lead has the property of healing all that is swollen in the limbs.</end_of_turn
If the swelling has already hardened and become solid, and if it is necessary to remove it, do so cautiously, and extract only the solid portion; then note the excessive bleeding and pain, or remove the soft parts until the swelling has subsided; and take care of the wound until it has healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter 21.</end_of_turn
On the restoration of a fracture when the limb is restored and the swelling has subsided, and how to proceed with the limb's subsequent use which does not correspond with its natural function.</end_of_turn
When a bone fracture has healed, and the limb is restored, swelling often remains. This swelling can be caused by several factors: a lack of flexibility of the ligament and surrounding tissue due to excessive stiffness; excessive tension on the ligament causing discomfort; excessive thickening of the ligament; excessive movement in an unnatural position; or general weakness and poor nutrition of the patient.</end_of_turn
Treatment for this is to feed the patient and make them comfortable until the wound has healed; administer bath; and give them broth and vinegar.</end_of_turn
And finally, keep the limb still so that the limb does not consume the nourishment, or continue to bandage it with wet cloth, until the nourishment returns to its natural state.</end>
Chapter 22.</end_of_turn
On the treatment of fractured bones which have been restored without displacement and how to prevent them from further displacement.</end_of_turn
When an injury has occurred to a limb that has already healed, if there is displacement of the fractured bone or swelling, do not move the limb violently. Even though it is important to keep the limb still, do not prevent the limb from performing its natural function.</end_of_turn
Indeed, many foolish doctors and healers have made mistakes in this matter, and this treatment can be dangerous, leading to great fear of death.</end_of_turn
If the swelling is recent, mix it with wet cloth in which there are many soothing herbs such as chamomile and rue, and meadowsweet, and it should be plastered with plaster of Paris or ointment of the same kind; or take a mixture of alum and oil of rosemary or beeswax.
And every day the swelling should be softened with gentle rubbing that is both wet and humid, and the limb should be exercised in all positions at all hours.</end_of_turn>
If the swelling has already hardened and become solid, and if it is necessary to treat it, do so with an iron, for the pus must be drained and the continuity of the bone must be dissolved, and note that excessive pressure of the swelling on the surrounding tissues can cause permanent damage, and take care of that which is to be expected from that part in the neighborhood of that bone which is delicate and sensitive.</end_of_turn
Chapter 23.</end_of_turn
From speech concerning dislocation.
Dislocation is the immediate displacement of any joint of the limb, because it is prohibited from movement, and is accompanied by the figure of the limb, and brings about great pain and damage.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when an accident of dislocation occurs, it is necessary to perforate as soon as possible so that it can be reduced; and do not delay its reduction, for if it is delayed, the limb is swollen and strong, which makes it difficult to reduce the dislocation.</end_of_turn
And do not touch or stretch at the time of reduction, because moved veins cause spasms and pain.</end_of_turn
When this has happened, the doctor must command the patient to rest quietly in the discomfort of the pain, and should lay the limb immersed in lukewarm water and oil, and should reduce it with ease.</end_of_turn
And all the limb should be treated with the water from which the memory will remain in its limb.</end_of_turn>
And indeed I have ordered the heads of dislocation to be treated according to the order of fracture; from the part of the body higher up to the part of the body lower down.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXV.</end_of_turn>
Of the treatment of dislocation of the jawbone downwards.</end_of_turn>
So dislocated are both mandibles if they are not held; and the dislocation of both is useful according to two methods: either they are slightly displaced from their places for little mobility, or they are completely dislocated and complete, until they are softened at the junction where saliva comes from the pain and does not want to open its mouth, and its tongue is wrapped in its sputum.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is slight, the limb will return to its place by itself with little cause.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is complete and complex, the limb must be urgently reduced, and must not be delayed at all.</end_of_turn
And the minister has the head of the patient, and the doctor places his thumb on the root of the mandible that is dislocated, if the dislocation is of one side; or the doctor places two thumbs together in the middle, if the dislocation is of two sides, and the others say of the most of them that they are outside of them; and commands the patient to stop his mandibles and take away those that are not in their place; and the doctor grasps the mandible and supports the mandible until it returns to its rightful place.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction is difficult, and more so if both mandibles are simultaneously dislocated, the doctor should administer evaporation with lukewarm water and oil, until it is finally successful in reducing both of them, and not wait for both of them to reduce at the same time, as we have said.</end_of_turn
And therefore when they have returned and are softened, and the patient’s mouth is closed and not softened, the doctor should rest upon those little grains of millet around the root, and apply wax and oil; and hold firmly with ease.</end_of_turn
And let the patient sleep on his two limbs, and let his head be supported between two cushions, so that neither the right side nor the left side is touched; and do not force him to bite for any reason; have the limb well bandaged, so that when the pain is gone and the mandibles are not dislocated, the limb may be moved without pain.</end_of_turn
And when the evacuation is administered easily, and not work on the opening of the mouth to force swallowing and drinking and speaking, until the mandible is set and healed.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction of two mandibles is difficult when they are simultaneously dislocated at any time and are not converted into their proper places, the doctor must know that fever and persistent vomiting are dangerous for the patient’s belly, and that he is extremely agitated.
When this happens often, the doctor must know that it is a loss; and that no one survives whom this has happened to in a few days.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXV.</end_of_turn>
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the furcula and of the extremity of the muscle.</end_of_turn
The furcula is not dislocated from the side where it joins with the feet; and some say that it is displaced outwards, and that is known by the feeling.</end_of_turn
And the restoration is that the patient grasps his two limbs and extends his arms.</end_of_turn And quickly cover the wound with your palm, with a strong covering, so that it returns.
And quickly cover the wound with your palm, with a strong covering, so that it returns
May the limb that has suffered the wound continue to be supported by that, not being dislocated in any day; for it is to be reduced and dressed according to what has been said and as it appears to you.
And quickly cover the wound with your palm, with a strong covering, and extract, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And in this method of treatment the limb of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from the hip joint
Chapter XXVI.</start_of_turn>
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle
You know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which is one that it is dislocated from the part of the titillis to the part beyond
And the second is that it is dislocated from above the muscle, and that is sufficient; it is not dislocated at the back by the scapula; and it is not dislocated at the front by the nerves
And most often it is dislocated outwards from the part beyond the titillis, and more so in those in which the flesh is little, willingly it is dislocated; but in those in which there are many bones, it is difficult to pull it out
And many times it happens in men by percussion or violence, and the muscle of them is loosened from its place, and is cured as soon as it has been dislocated
Then cover it so that you are certain that it is sufficiently done, and when you are sure that you have completed the treatment
And it is known that the dislocation of the muscle is when it is to the part beyond the titillis; so that you may distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the sound muscle, for you will find among these various signs; and you will find the head of the muscle hollow and the titillis beyond the touch of the head of the muscle just as if there were a hole, and the patient cannot reduce his hand to the hip joint, or make any movement at all.</start_of_turn>
If it is dislocated from the foot or from above, and you find a mark of it on the touch, do not be deceived.
And in this dislocation is useful a quick reduction when it is fresh and the patient is young.</start_of_turn>
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the hand to the part above; and immediately place the ankles under the titillis of the limb, and raise the joint with force at the hip joint, and the minister raises the hand and extends it; and immediately pause so that it returns willingly.</start_of_turn
May it be that what we have said is not returned, and so from the beginning of the dislocation, for several days, the patient should be bathed in warm water and be administered embrocation that softens and soothes just as if it were composed of the hairs of a horse, and fennel, and marigold in water, and be administered.</start_of_turn
And immediately the patient should be placed lying down on the hips and be supported under the titillis of the limb until the swelling has subsided between elevation and tension, and the physician should place his hand over the hip and raise the head of the muscle with force, and the minister should grasp the hand of the patient so that it is not bruised at the parts below, and another minister should hold the head of the patient, so that it is not bruised at the parts below, for all these things must return to the hip joint.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: and that you find a man who is longer than the patient and is at the side of the patient, and that you interpose the hip of the muscle between the titillis of the patient and elevate the titillis to the parts above until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the hand of the patient from the parts below the hip.</start_of_turn And if the patient is urgent, the hours must be that another cause is suspended, so that it does not worsen, for the dislocation will return immediately.</start_of_turn
And it is reduced immediately in another manner: and that a long staff be placed on the ground with a round head, like a mallet, which is not thick or thin, and that it be placed under the patient; because when it is placed over the head of the staff, the patient is standing according to the length of the staff, and the hand is extended to the parts below the other side; and the body is extended from the other side with force, so that the joint returns to the hip joint quickly.</start_of_turn
If it is difficult to reduce the swelling for all the reasons mentioned above, use this remedy: take a fistful of the amount that is as long as two fists and as wide as four fingers, and make it thick in the palm of the hand like this.
Then place over the head of the patient some layers of wool or linen so that the fist does not damage the patient
And place the thumb of the patient under the fist and extend the hand or arms over the fist inside the parts under the thighs, and tie the fist over the cushion and the arms and the wrist
And place the arms on a scale as wide as the thighs, and the hand is extended to the parts under the thighs, and the other limb is suspended from the other part, so that the joint is within.
And when the swelling is complete according to any possible way, then stop and place upon the thumb a prepared plaster of powder of mustard and egg white over all the muscles, even if it is twisted downwards, and strengthen the thumb with tight binding; and the ligament is twisted over the plaster, and the hand is fixed to the forearm, and keep it quiet for seven days.
And keep the patient's diet reduced until the limb is comforted, for it is more pleasant for the healing of the limb.
And let food be given in greater quantity about the seventh or eighth day, or let the limb be exercised; and thus if it is stopped and is not softened, the hour has already healed
But if the joint is displaced somewhat by humidity that happens to it or for another reason, then it is necessary to administer cautery three times, as it is said in the chapter of cautery
And if all this has been done and seven days have passed, the ligament is detached and the joint is not fixed, and the plaster and the binding are reduced over it somewhat loosened, and it is not fixed and relaxed and cannot elevate the limb above the parts below, then you must know that the nerves of the limb, which are at the head of the muscle, are already insensible or extended or softened, and that the joint will never be fixed in place again.
From the dislocation of that which is useful to give the thigh and the knee or the parts behind, the reduction is useful with impulse and extension with the most, until it returns.
And let it be administered in this other tightening, and take care that it is healed.<end_turn>
And if it happens that the healing of the limb is delayed by gravity in the limb and tardiness in the movement of the limb, then the doctor must use cold packs until that gravity is relieved and the limb returns to its former state
Chapter XXVII.</end_turn>
Of the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.</end_turn>
You must know that the ankle joint is dislocated with difficulty and almost returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated throughout is more especially at the front than at the back, and the dislocation of the limb is not hidden from you that it is caused either by leaving it untouched or by touching it according to any figure that is dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated ankle, that is to say that you make the ankle flexible, the joint is concave and cannot bend the limb, nor touch any of the muscles.</end_turn
And you must know that the ankle, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible before it becomes fixed with cautery, for if you see it fixed with cautery, it is difficult to reduce it, and it is not well healed of all; and especially when it is at the back, for it is worse of all other kinds of dislocation, and for greater pain, and many veins are seen to be clotted at that time.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the thumb is extended with two hands, and the arms are expanded, and the hands of the doctor are over the ankle and under it, and the plaster is put on the joint with the nails of the thumbs together, or with the heel of the palm against it until it returns to its place.</end_turn
And even if the dislocation is at the front, the doctor must return it as soon as possible so that he can touch the ankle with his hand, except that he perforates the ankle with the heel of the palm of his hand.</end_turn
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, the doctor must administer violent extension and force.</end_turn
And that two assistants extend the arms, and hold that support two assistants so that it is not left behind due to the extension.</end_turn
E aprop sia revolvut le bras deves tota part, pus que es envolopat drap doblat lonc sobre la ma de lu, o liament.
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that these are the causes that help to lubricate the joint and facilitate; and then press the joint with force inwards until it returns.</end_of_turn>
Then reduce it, cover it so that there is stasis on the bruise in which there is stasis and exudate with vinegar, and extract it with tension, suspend the arm from the collarbone, and leave it for several days.</end_of_turn>
Then untie; and therefore if the joint is formed in the heel, then you untie the ligament from it and leave it thus.</end_of_turn>
And if the joint does not mend, then you repeat the packing and the ligament, and leave it thus for several days until it is extracted; and then untie that.</end_of_turn>
But if the accident happens to it towards the reduction of the joint, and the position is in movement, then administer humidity in bath and friction in moderation, and understand, until it is relieved; or rest upon the joint relieved, so that there is no fatty movement; and tie it up, and leave it thus for the day and the night.</end_of_turn And thus do that, and put it into the bath; and when it swells, then you cool the joint with temperate friction, and then repeat over that relieved, so that it is harmonious in movement, once, twice, and three times.</end_of_turn The corruption has already spread throughout the bowels within the bath, until it has reached the limit.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, rest upon that wound of the moist cow and scald it along the edge and over that; and make some compresses, so that it is moist and reduces to its position.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of dislocation of the limb, that is between the arm and the hand.</end_of_turn
A dislocation of the hand frequently occurs; the reduction of the dislocation is easy, unlike that of the other joints, however cover that the speed of reduction in the moment in which it is dislocated, since it can cause bruising or that an injury occurs in it during the bruise.</end_of_turn
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the hand of the patient on a table and extend the hand of that, and the doctor places his hand or palm on the vicinity of the joint, and press that until it returns to its normal position.</end_of_turn
However, it must be considered if the palm is already bowed inward of the hand, then the patient should place two of his hands on a table beside the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is previous, you should place two hands of the patient, so that the hand of the doctor lies over that vicinity of the joint.</end_of_turn
And thus if it returns well, it is good; otherwise, press that again with packing yielding the bruise and leave that; do not repeat that until, because of suffering or doing more harm to the reduction.</end_of_turn
However, the joint remains according to its tortuousity; and do not note to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot withstand any cause; the hours say that the nerves are cut or crushed, and that it is not strained in it except for being stretched by the wound and for that cause.</end_of_turn
Therefore when the limb is returned, the hours pause over it the packing that have been recommended, and let it rest and stretch for five days; and then untie that and let it rest and exercise the hand.</end_of_turn
However if its movement is delayed and an accident occurs in it some degree, the hours softens that with cold water and make some compresses, until it is relieved.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXIX.</end_of_turn
Of the care of dislocation of the fingers.</end_of_turn
Some fingers are dislocated throughout.</end_of_turn
And when one of those fingers is dislocated at the base of the palm or on the underside, the hours stretch it and press the dislocation back with the thumbs, until it returns.</end_of_turn
And support the head of the digit, suspend that which deviates from its place, and leave that for two days.
And suspend that and extend that until it becomes even in that limb that day.
And when the night has passed, lie that one according to that narrative, and do not cease loosening that one in the day and exercising with movement, and lie that one in the night; and do this for a few days until it is healed.
And remain like that, if it is dislocated at the wrist, and lie that one to that part and do that the first operation, until it is healed.
And remain like that in the same way when it is dislocated in other parts.
End of text.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the bones of the foot.
When an accident happens to some of the bones of the foot or the heel dislocation completed, and so many bones remain loose from their place, in that case treatment is not appropriate, for death covers the disease.
And a sign of that is that the evacuation of the disease is outside the will, and cannot be retained; and many veins are softened in some parts of it or two veins of it or two branches of it, or one of them; or that a bone has become loose from its place, for that one has become loose and the soft parts are made useless for the evacuation of those four parts.
Therefore that one has already become loose in the back parts and is called gelosis.
May the treatment of it be that you consider if the gelosis occurred from infancy, for in that case neither treatment nor healing of all is possible
May in that case you see it by chance or by percussion or by suspicion, as the Ancients say, the ways of treatment are long, of which the most part returns for profit; may I already have abbreviated that of which little is spoken of because of my proximity to your understanding, to which I have exposed myself and explained it with various instruments from that which I showed you and explained.
And that one is cured only when it occurs in the two places precisely as I recommend.
And that the disease be extended over its face over the heel so that it be equal to the palm of the hand, and be extended leaving them soft so that they are not bruised by the foot
And put a vessel that has become loose to be fixed in the earth at the end of the toe around the head of the toe, and another vessel in the air at the other end of the toe.
The minister has the vessel, and it is not to be fastened in a pit; and another minister has the other in that form
And put a bandage over the head of the disease and leave the nails loosely bound with a loop; and extend the limb to the vessel which is over the head of the toe, and tie that one to it; and strengthen the other ligament over the ankles of the foot and over the bones of the foot, and tie those to the other vessel that is over the foot
And the minister grasps outside and extends the ligament to the part of the vessel, and they are not to be loosened from the two vessels and the ligaments of the limbs in which they are placed, but nevertheless do not keep them fixed as we have said.
And the physician places his palms on the bone with strength until it returns, or that he places on that a board, and that he adjusts over the board the two feet until they return
But if it does not return in this way, the physician takes a board whose breadth or length is three inches, and cuts in the wall from which we have said that the disease is over a place in which the limb of the board is placed And the physician places the palm of the hand on the bone, and the physician places the feet on the other limb, and stretches until the bone is shortened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, or turn the limb around the hand; and that you remain on the ground with the head of the disease behind the heel of the two vessels, the length of which is an elbow, and put the head of the toe behind the heel of the foot with two fingers; and let the length be between each vessel a palm, and that is enough in every vessel where there is a hole through which the limb has returned, and that no part is fixed on the ground so that it is not bruised
And let there be a round flask in which the turning is made, and let it be rotated in the two grooves of the two flasks.
And at the end of them is a groove in which the flask is formed, its length being equal to the width of the flask which is rotated; and in the two other flasks it is similar to this.</end_of_turn>
And draw tight the ligaments which you have stretched in the patient's feet in the groove which is above their head, and the ligaments which you have stretched in the space between their thighs in the turn which is above their feet.</end_of_turn>
And now you must make each turn and appoint a minister who will hold the turn with his hand, and the doctor will grasp the spine according to what has been said.</end_of_turn>
Then return the spine and the limb is grasped. Now cover that you have passed over the excitation with a cloth of hemp three fingers wide or more, and lay it down; and place your hand over the cloth and hold the heel of the limb so that the limb does not slip from the spine.</end_of_turn
And bind it with the ligament which has been mentioned, and use nourishing food for the patient until he is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if there remains any swelling in the limb at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer medicines which soften and lubricate the limb during the administration of the ointment, which has been recommended; and it is administered in that place with lead ointment.</end_of_turn>
And every wound which has happened in the heel of the two vertebrae is cured by that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already been mentioned because it is necessary that it should not suffer any further damage from this medicine, for it would cause its death.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXVI.</end_turn
Of the treatment of a dislocated ankle.</end_turn>
You must know that the ankle joint and the ankle muscle do not suffer anything else but dislocation only, and not from any other wound which occurs in the other parts of the limb which are raised and concave.</end_of_turn
The ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, that is, at the front, at the back, at the top, or at the bottom.</end_of_turn
Mostly it is dislocated at the front, and less at the top or at the bottom.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the front is that, when you adjust the limb of the healthy patient with the limb which is being treated, the great toe is longer and more prominent than the healthy one, and the limb cannot bend the knee over the ankle, and the ankle is already swollen from the cautery.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the back is that the accident of the limb is contrary to this one.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the top is that the limb is expanded according to the rule, more so however it does not bend where it should because of the pain, and if you force it to go forward it cannot go over that which is in front; and the urine is retained and the limb is swollen, and you must walk the limb over the heel.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the bottom is that it does not expand the toe, or does not permit bending of that which should bend, and the limb is shorter than the other, and the swelling is softened, and the heel is above that place.</end_of_turn
Moreover, in this treatment it is necessary to consider that if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it is already obsolete by the time you arrive with this treatment, for you must not do anything which might cause its death.</end_of_turn
Moreover, in the recent one which is one of the four species of dislocation, you must hold the joint still and extend the limb both at the front and the back, and also at the right and left, for that is how the limb will return and will not suffer further from any other treatment.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare strong ministers and extend the limb from the lower part, or from the knees, or from the ligament which is bound over the limb below the toe; and another minister shall extend the hand of that which is beside it and put his hands on the toes; and strengthen the limb with another minister over the ankle bone.
And let the extension of the thigh or from the hip to the ankle, or from the hip to the heel or from the hip to the buttocks.
And let the extension of all of them be together until the patient is elevated with the seat of the earth and that remains hanging down
And this kind of extension is common to all four.
And thus if the dislocation returns to what we have said, it will be well; otherwise, the time has come to resort to all kinds of treatment which we have mentioned
In the reduction of itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is at the hip, cover that the patient is supported over the seat of the buttocks; and place your hand over the ligament at the root of the thigh in that place where between the head of the thigh and the place that is left to hang down; and extend the ligament from the ankle to the highest part of the pelvis.
And another minister should firmly grasp the patient's thighs, and compress the great part of the painful thigh and extend outwards for violent extension, so that that which returns to the sitting place
And this kind of treatment is lighter than the others with which this limb is reduced
More if he is excused for you and does not obey the order with this kind of treatment, the time has come that both feet of the patient be bound firmly with strong ligature, with fear, over both ankles and over both toes
And let the length of each by the quantity of four fingers, and let the painful limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
And let the patient be suspended over the head of the foot, and that be in the middle; and let the length of them from the earth be the quantity of two thighs.
And let a strong young man command to bend the head of the thigh, and that be suspended with the patient another young man, and the other young man will press the thigh with force so that the joint returns to the sitting place with speed.
And in the reduction itself, when it is dislocated at the hip, cover that the patient walks over his foot according to what we have recommended in the above-mentioned treatises; and keep the ligament stretched over the painful limb itself and over the foot of the patient.
And two cushions should be placed, one under the patient's feet, and the other under the head; and two cushions should be placed adjusted to the middle of the limb that is placed over which a damp cloth is wrapped, so that the patient is not dampened because the limb is between the patient's thighs, because the extension must be towards the outside not towards the inside
And let each minister extend their part, and the doctor with his hand grasp the reduction according to the art
And when the dislocation is at the hip, the time has come that the limb be extended fearfully; and thus as this medicine tells us about the thigh; and the doctor will place the palm of his right hand over the painful hip, and with the other hand he will grasp that which is at the other hip, and in that grasp he will pause that which is extended towards the toes from the hip part
And if the dislocation is at the buttocks, the time has not come that the patient be extended towards the toes, but that it be elevated over the earth; having covered that it should be held firmly, thus as if the thigh were dislocated at the hip, as we have said about the lying of the limb over two fingers; and it is over his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, not without pain.
And let compression be administered to the table over the place where the joint is.
Therefore when the reduction is accomplished as we have said — and the signal of the reduction of the limb is not hidden from you, that is that you extend the patient's two limbs, and when you have once again embraced those and the patient has stretched out his limb and expanded that limb that you excused, then you know that the limb according to what we have said is returned — and then you adjust two cushions and hold firmly and pull out with a bandage so that the limb is not bruised in any part; and let the patient rest in peace for three days or for four.
And take out the ligament and the bandage, and compare one limb with the other.
When, however, these humors have settled upon the skin, it is understood that the dislocation has already ceased, and therefore the patient can be allowed to move around.
If any cause of dislocation remains, then return it and place that limb firmly in its place, and extract that according to your first structure, and leave that limb for three days.</end_of_turn>
Then remove that and make the limb walk slowly over something for several days, until it is comforted.</end_of_turn>
(The text ends abruptly here, without completing the translation of the remaining sentences.)</end_of_turn>
Treatment for dislocation of the knee.</end_of_turn>
The knee is dislocated in three ways, that is, when it is displaced from the lateral side, from the medial side, and from the front to the back; but not from the back.</end_of_turn
The sign of dislocation is that the patient applies pressure to the thigh over the knee; when this is done, it is understood that the knee is dislocated.</end_of_turn
The restoration of all these ways is that you make the patient cease the pain, because when he has extended his limb, if you can, place two fingers of your hand on the front of his limb, and put his foot between his thighs; and make him adhere the knee to your palms, and hold those between his thighs over the knee until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
The sign of recovery is that his limb adheres easily to the thigh without labor without floating.</end_of_turn
Then place that limb firmly and make him adhere the limb to the thigh, and bind those together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove them.</end_of_turn
Do not have the patient walk for several days until he is healthy and comfortable.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation has been reduced by you, however, administer strong stretching to the ligaments that were previously treated for the bruise.</end_of_turn
End of treatise.</end_of_turn
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.</end_
The ankle is sometimes dislocated for a slight displacement, and sometimes by violent force, and the dislocation can be caused either from the front or from the back.</end_of_turn
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells up as a result of the displacement from the part from which it is dislocated.</end_of_turn
The treatment for its displacement is gentle reduction, that is, that it is extended with ease and held together until it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
But in the treatment of violent dislocation, that is, when the dislocation is from behind, make the patient cease the pain and keep that limb firmly in its place from the back of the two preceding it in its normal position.</end_of_turn
And put your right hand on the front of the foot and your left hand on the back of the foot at the ankle level.</end_of_turn
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and hold it for two pulses, and then extend it; and hold the ankle firmly against the pain.</end_of_turn
Do it twice as we have counted.</end_of_turn
And hold the foot against the bruise for the third pulse, and you are at the ankle.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if it returns in one or two pulses following this manner, and if sometimes the foot swells up, it is good; otherwise, repeat the operation until it returns.</end_of_turn
If it is forbidden for you to reduce it in this way, make the patient sit with his two legs on the ground, and make him lie down on the ground, and place a cushion between his thighs, and you have already bandaged his foot over his ankle so that he does not bruise him.</end_of_turn
And make the other minister hold his thighs, and another minister extend his foot towards his buttocks or towards the ligament that lies over the ankle; and extend whichever minister you like against the extension of the limb, and the cushion remains between the patient’s thighs so that the body of the limb is not pulled towards the lower parts due to the extension.</end_of_turn
And the doctor grasps the dislocation at the hip joint, while another assistant holds the healthy limb away from the affected area, so that the dislocation can be easily returned to its place.
And thus, when the dislocation has been returned and it is declared that the reduction is successful, then pause the plaster and gently stretch that which is taut, and join the limb to the limb above the wound
And take care that you fear or guard the nerves which are behind the ankle, so that the ligament above that is not tight and the one below is not loose.
And keep it covered for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, remove that
And on the fourth day or the fifth, remove that, and prohibit the patient from eating for forty days. Maybe if it is necessary to go forward with that space, it is not useless to take care that the dislocation is not dissolved and corrupted, and that you do not neglect the one that does not receive care.
And if by chance it happens outside the wound that the patient has a relapse, then cover that you administer in the cessation of that which precedes our narration, in another place of care and embrocation, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter xxxiiii.</start_of_turn>
On the care of dislocations of the joints of the feet.</start_of_turn>
Take care that that which is dislocated is grasped with little extension, and that which is not difficult, abstain from it.</start_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in the ankle bones of the two feet, then take care that you make the patient sit with his foot resting on the ground or on a table, and that he remains in that way as if he were going.</start_of_turn
And keep your feet still, and place the limb on that which you have mentioned concerning the joints, and gently press that which is above that which has been dislocated until it returns, and see that that which has been grasped has returned and does not reappear in the immediate area.</start_of_turn
And put under the foot of the limb a table that covers all the foot, which has two caps, and press that which is stretched downwards and closed for three days; and then remove that and make the limb rest for four days, until it is restored and the recovery is ensured.</start_of_turn
Chapter xxxv.</start_of_turn
Of the species of dislocations that are caused by swelling or fracture or by some other lesion.</start_of_turn
When any of those causes happen, and you take care of the treatment of that and the restoration of it, many times death follows.</start_of_turn
And concerning the treatment of that, do not presume that you can manage it alone, but that one who is skilled in the art, of long experience, merciful and humble, tardy, not arrogant or presumptuous; and that you use at the beginning of medicines that do not cause additional harm, but read the patient carefully, not to that one whom you hope for salvation from loss, but to that one from whom you hope relief from the disease, and in which some hope appears. And then try with all your strength to reduce it at the beginning of the disease, before the wound bursts.</start_of_turn
And if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that causes the wound to heal with the help of the other desiccant remedies.</start_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in fractured bones and the bones are separated from each other, then you puncture the ligament between them, and do as we have said in the simple diseases of what has been said concerning those.</start_of_turn
And guard and abstain from everything that your prudence dictates, following my prediction as much as you are accustomed to doing; for what is better for you than the Creator Himself, and more lasting to your glory, and more respectful to the true God than those things that are in the heavens? Thus ends the book of Albucasim, perfectly blessed by God.</start_of_turn> Amen.</start_of_turn
