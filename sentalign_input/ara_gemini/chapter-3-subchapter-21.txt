Chapter twenty-one on the treatment of a fracture if it has healed and the limb remains.
After that, it becomes thin, unlike its original nature, if the bone fracture heals, and the limb remains thin and weak, then this is due to many reasons, one of which is either due to the frequent loosening of the ligaments and tying them in a way that is not appropriate.
Or due to excessive tightening of the ligaments until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb.
Or due to excessive and frequent suspension/dangling.
Or due to excessive movements at the wrong time.
Or due to the lack of blood in the patient's body and his weakness.
And the treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until the blood increases in it, and to use the bath, and to bring him joy and happiness, and so on.
Then apply tar to the limb so that the tar attracts a lot of nourishment to it, or continue suspending/dangling it with lukewarm water until the nourishment flows into it and it returns to its natural shape.
