The eighth chapter on the mending of ribs if they are broken.	CHAPTER EIGHT. On the repair of ribs when they are fractured.	0.75350416
Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick parts adjacent to the back. And their front ends are subject to bruising because they are cartilaginous. Knowing this is not hidden from the senses when examining with the fingers.	You should know that fracture of the ribs occurs only at the thick parts bordering on the vertebrae, whereas the anterior extremities are only contused, because they are cartilaginous; this is easily diagnosed on examination with the fingers.	0.86541146
Its reduction is by straightening the fracture with the fingers in the most effective way until the shape is as it should be. Then bandage and tighten the broken bone with a splint if needed.	They should be set by levelling out the fracture with the fingers in any manner you can so that the form is as it should be; then apply the plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.	0.8370979
If the rib fracture is tilted inwards, it causes the patient severe pain and a stabbing sensation like the stabbing that occurs to someone with pleurisy, because the bone stabs the diaphragm. It also causes him difficulty breathing, coughing, and coughing up a lot of blood, and this is difficult to treat.	If it be a depressed fracture of the ribs, then the patient will have a vehement pain and a piercing sensation like that of pleurisy, since the bone is piercing the pleura; in addition he will have difficulty in breathing and will cough, and vomit much blood; the treatment of this is difficult.	0.8941444
The ancients devised many tricks for it.	In this the Ancients practised many devices.	0.7233229
Some of them said it is necessary to make the patient's food something that generates flatulence and wind so that the abdomen swells and expands and pushes the fracture outwards.	Some said that the patient should have food of such a kind as to generate wind and inflation to blow out and stretch the belly and so push out the fracture.	0.8950602
We dislike this lest it confirms the occurrence of a hot swelling if it has not occurred. If it has occurred, it increases and confirms it.	We, however, reject this, since it will excite an effusion if one has not already arisen; and if one has arisen it will increase and confirm it.	0.8066479
Some of them said a cupping glass is placed on the area and then sucked strongly, and this is more like the standard, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will attract superfluities to the area because of its weakness.	Some of them said a cupping-vessel should be applied to the place and strong suction be made; this seems more reasonable except that there is a risk of the vessel's drawing superfluities to the place on account of his weak state.	0.7731675
Some of them said the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil, and padding should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, so that the bandage is level when you wrap it around circularly.	Some of them said that the place should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil and that a pad should be placed in the intercostal space to fill it up so as to make the bandaging level when you wind it round.	0.8955457
Then treat the patient with the treatment of pleurisy in terms of food and medicine.	Then treat the patient with diet and medicines as for pleurisy.	0.9105974
If the patient is exhausted by a severe matter that he cannot bear and the bone stabs the diaphragm with a harmful stab, and we fear for the patient, then we should incise the area and expose the broken rib. Then we put under it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which has been described previously, and cut the bone gently and take it out.	If the patient is in such a bad way that he cannot bear it, the bone painfully piercing the pleura, and we are afraid for him, then we shall have to cut down upon the place and lay bare the broken rib; then we place under it the instrument to protect the membrane, which has been described, and gently cut out the bone and remove it.	0.85881495
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures and treat it with ointments until it heals.	Then the edges of the wound should be joined, with a suture if large, and dressed with ointments until healed.	0.8847836
If a hot swelling occurs during that, immediately wet padding in rose oil and place it on the area. And treat the patient with what soothes the swelling from the inside as well, and he should lie on the side that makes sleep easier for him until he recovers.	If meanwhile there arise an abscess, quickly soak pads in oil of roses and apply them to the place and treat the patient with internal remedies against abscess too. Let him lie upon the side which is easier for him to sleep on, until it heals.	0.88080525
