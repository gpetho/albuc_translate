On the Cauterization for Water Falling into the Eye.	On cautery in cataract of the eye.	0.6251252
When the onset of water in the eye is identified by the signs mentioned in the division, begin by giving the patient something to cleanse their head and avoid all humid substances.	When by those signs I have mentioned in the relevant section there is brought to your notice the beginning of a cataract of the eye, start with draughts for the patient such as shall cleanse his head; and guard him from all humidities.	0.74379396
Make them sweat in a steam bath for several days.	Make him also sweat for some days, fasting, in the bath.	0.6507623
Then shave their head and cauterize the middle of the head. Additionally, cauterize the two temples if water is affecting both eyes, or one side if only one eye is affected.	Then tell him to have his head shaved; and burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head; then cauterize him with two burns on the temples if the cataract is beginning in both eyes; or on the one side only if it is in one eye.	0.74921143
Incise with the cautery all veins and arteries beneath the skin. The cauteries should be long and lateral on the temples.	And with the cautery cut all the subcutaneous veins and arteries; and let the cauterizations be long, across the breadth of the temples.	0.78308415
Be careful to prevent bleeding when cauterizing; if bleeding occurs, stop it with any possible medicine.	Beware of haemorrhage; if you see any, stanch it straight away with any means you can.	0.7332107
I will provide further guidance on the extraction and excision of arteries and controlling bleeding.	We shall deal later on with the method of extraction and cutting out of arteries, and provision against haemorrhage.	0.7312149
Sometimes, cauterization is done on the neck below the two bones with two subsequent cauteries.	Two strong cauterizations are sometimes made on the back of the neck below the two bones.	0.833284
