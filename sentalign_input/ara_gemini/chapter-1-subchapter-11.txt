Chapter eleven on cauterizing melancholia
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize him with the cauterizations that we mentioned for the stroke patient.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclining towards black bile, and the patient's body is moist, give him to drink what purifies his brain as mentioned previously in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head.
Then make a well-sealed ring-like cake of linen.
Then place it in the middle of his head while the patient is sitting cross-legged, holding it from all sides.
Then take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it on the fire to a moderate heat, as much as the finger can bear when inserted in it.
Then pour it into the middle of his head within the circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the patient once every week, along with all his other good management, until he recovers, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, dotted cauterizations, without holding your hand on the cautery iron, but rather with a quick touch.
For this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply cotton soaked in the fat or in chicken fat.
