On venesection of the two arteries in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic migraines or severe catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the temples' muscles, or a severe chronic headache, and so on, and has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried, for these ailments, venesection of the arteries in the temples or cauterizing them as we have described.
The method of venesection is to shave the patient's hair on the temples and aim for the artery that appears in the temple, as it is evident from its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in some individuals.
Or, in extreme cold, if it is hidden from you, have the patient tighten their neck with a piece of their clothing, then rub the area with a cloth or apply a hot water compress until the artery appears clearly and distinctly.
Then take the lancet, which is pictured here.
Then gently incise the skin with it until you reach the artery, then insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you extract it from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut a portion of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract without causing bleeding, for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not flow at all. Then draw from six to three ounces of blood.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong, doubled thread. The thread should be either silk or lute strings so that it doesn't decay before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the two ties. You can do this at that moment or later.  If you wish, you can cauterize it to the bone with a cautery knife until its ends are severed, which serves the same purpose, or even better, as we have said.
However, if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, cauterization helps to eliminate the humors, so it is more beneficial. After incising the arteries, the area should be packed with aged cotton and secured with bandages. After the release, it should be treated with desiccative medications that promote flesh growth and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during the procedure, immediately stop it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with vitriol and pressing your hand until the bleeding stops.  If none of these are available, apply your finger until the blood clots.
Wash the area with very cold water to reduce the inflammation and bandage it as needed.  A gentler and easier method than incising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the two spots with ink.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and severs the vessel in two places so that the ends are separated, as they will definitely not rejoin with this cauterization.  This is an image of the cautery.
Its two blades are sharp, resembling small scalpels, though much less sharp than a scalpel, because if they were as sharp as a scalpel, they would cool down too quickly and not cut the flesh quickly. If they are somewhat thick, they retain the heat of the fire.
And it cuts the flesh quickly. This method is better than any other, gentler and easier.  The space between the two blades should be about the width of a finger.
