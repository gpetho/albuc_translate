On extracting the stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and I mentioned the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the stone generated in the bladder and the signs of all of that, and I mentioned the stone in which the work is done by hand and incision.
And it is the stone generated specifically in the bladder and that which sticks in the urethra, and I will describe that with a clear explanation and brevity.
So I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in boys and among its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he rubs his penis and fiddles with it, and it often hangs low then spreads out, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them, and recovery from it is easy for boys until they reach fourteen years, and it is difficult in old men, and as for youths, it is intermediate between that.
And the one whose stones are larger, his treatment is easier, and the small ones are the opposite of that. So if we proceed to the treatment, it is necessary first to inject the ill person with an enema that expels all the filth that is in his intestines, for it may prevent the discovery of the stone during the examination.
Then the sick person is taken by his feet and shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times. Then you sit him upright before you with his hands under his thighs so that the whole bladder inclines downwards, then you examine him.
And you palpate him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the open space, then immediately proceed with the incision over it. But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to anoint the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a mature youth, you insert it in his anus and search for the stone until, when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then you press on it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you want to make the incision.
And you order an assistant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and you order another assistant to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand and with his other hand to stretch the skin that is under the testicles away from the location where the incision will be. Then you take the extracting scalpel which has this form:.
And you make an incision between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock, and the incision should be directly over the stone with your finger in the anus and you pressing it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, just enough for the stone to come out.
No larger, for perhaps the finger that is in the anus might press the stone at the time of the incision so that it comes out without difficulty.  And know that there may be some stones that have angles and edges, which makes their exit difficult for that reason.
And some of them are smooth, resembling acorns, and rounded, so their exit is easy. As for those that have angles and edges, you widen the incision a little. If it does not come out this way, then it is necessary to use a trick on it, either by grasping it with strong forceps, the tip of which is like a file.
so that it grips the stone and does not slip from it, or you insert a delicate instrument with a curved end under it.  If you are unable to get it with that, then widen the incision a little.  If some of the blood overwhelms you, stop it with vitriol.
If there is more than one, first push the larger one to the mouth of the bladder, then incise over it, then push the smaller one after that, and likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, then it is foolish to make a large incision over it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either he dies or he perpetually dribbles urine because the place will not heal at all. But try to push it until it comes out, or contrive to break it with forceps until you get it out piece by piece.
When you have finished your work, stuff the wound with frankincense, aloe, and acacia, and bandage it, and place over it rags moistened with oil and syrup or rose oil and cold water to soothe the burning swelling. Then the patient should lie on his back and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with the palm ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals.  If excessive burning swelling occurs in the wound, and erosion, and the like, such as if blood congeals in the bladder and blocks the urine, and this is known by the discharge of blood with the urine,
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will lead to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with its corresponding treatment until it heals.
And it is necessary at all times of treatment to tie the thighs and bring them together to secure the medicines that are placed on the area.  If the stone is small and has entered the urethra and become lodged in it and prevents the passage of urine, treat it as I have described before it enters the perineum.
For I have often avoided the perineal incision with this treatment, and I have tested it, which is that you take a forked instrument of steel whose form is this:.
Triangular at the tip, sharp, and inserted into a handle.  Then you take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder. Then insert the forked instrument gently into the urethra until the fork reaches the stone itself.
And rotate the fork with your hand around the stone little by little as you intend to pierce it until you penetrate it from the other side, for the urine will flow immediately. Then squeeze your hand on what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to an obstacle preventing you from doing it, tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two ties, then extract it.
Then untie the thread and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound. The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other tie above is so that when the thread is untied after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it returns when you are finished and covers the wound as we have said.
