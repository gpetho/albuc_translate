On the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocated, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excrement comes out involuntarily, and cannot be held, and often some limbs are weakened, either both thighs or both arms or one.  And often the spine is distorted in four ways; that which is distorted backwards is called "gibbosity": the treatment is that you see if the gibbosity has come from childhood: if so there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or blows or similar things, the ancients spoke of methods of treatment with grand words, where there is not much benefit in any of them; but I have shortened it according to my understanding, and have designed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the worst in front, there is no remedy or healing; and also that which comes directly on both sides, and one cannot treat except that which comes properly on the back, as I said; and it is that the patient be stretched out on their face in an even place, and has support underneath, so that they are not injured; then firmly fix a stake at the head in the ground, and another at the feet, and tie a cord under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles; and two assistants pull the cords, one at the head and the other at the feet, through the two stakes; and they should be well secured, the stakes as we have said, and the physician puts his palms firmly on the spine, until it returns to place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, then take a board three cubits long, and wedge it under the wall, and the patient should be on their side, and put the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and the physician places his feet on the other end of the board, and presses well, until it returns to place; and if you wish, do it with a winch that turns by hand.
And you should fix two stakes at the head of the patient, a cubit high, and towards the feet two others, and have between each stake, above and below, a handspan of space in length; and each stake should have a hole, where the winch runs, and the stakes should be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move; and between each two stakes there should be a turning stake, on which the cords turn, and there should be on the two turning stakes two small stakes a handspan long, to turn the winch; and then tie the cord that is through the armpits to the winch towards the head, and the other cord towards the feet to the other winch, and each of the assistants turns his winch with all the cord, and the master puts the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, apply a desiccative plaster with plenty of egg, and then the padding, and then the splint from a board three fingers long, so that it covers the place of the gibbosity and the healthy part of the vertebra, then tie it with a cord, as we have said, and the patient consumes a light diet, until they are healed; and if anything arises at the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we mentioned before; and sometimes a piece of lead is applied there, and sometimes the appearance arises in the last vertebra of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone that protrudes, for which one should not have presumption: by chance it would cause death.
