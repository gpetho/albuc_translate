Chapter Twenty-Three.	CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE.	0.82328653
Dislocation of the jaw is a displacement of the joint from its place, which hinders movement, deforms the appearance of the limb, and causes severe aches and pains to the patient.  Whenever someone experiences a jaw dislocation, it should be promptly reduced.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt. When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all.	0.87574947
It should not be delayed at all, for if it is delayed, the area will swell, making it difficult to reduce the jaw. Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor should it be moved or stretched while swollen, because it often causes convulsions and harmful pains to the patient.	For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult. So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	0.8721004
But if this happens, it is necessary to immediately bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling subsides a little, then anoint the limb with hot water and oil, then gently reduce it and treat each limb as will be mentioned in its place.	Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little. Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced. And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	0.85546887
I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw according to what preceded in the fracture, from the top of the body to the bottom.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.818881
