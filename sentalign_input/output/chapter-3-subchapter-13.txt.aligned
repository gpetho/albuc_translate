Of the fracture of the hand	On the repair of fractures of the palm and fingers.	0.461559
Know that on the back of the hand and at the joints of the fingers, fractures rarely occur, and most often it is just a dislocation.	Fractures of the metacarpus and of the small bones of the fingers very rarely occur; the only frequent occurrence is contusion.	0.6917567
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or dislocated, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit upright; then place their hand on a stretched cloth, and the assistant stretches the fractured bones, and the physician sets them evenly, until they are well joined; then apply the poultice and the padding, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and wrap it in a linen cloth.	When a fracture or crushing of the palm of the hand occurs the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of the right height in front of him, on which he should put his outstretched hand. Then an assistant is to extend the broken bones while the doctor straightens them so as to achieve a proper union. Then a plaster and a dressing should be applied, if an effusion do not occur; then a splint over that, measured to the site and wrapped in a soft cloth.	0.8945155
And if the fracture is on the underside around the palm, then make a pad of cloths, and instruct the patient to press it against the fractured palm; then bind it with a long cloth, and the splint should be soft wood as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as needed.	If the fracture be lower down, near the inner part of the palm of the hand, make a ball of cloth, bid the patient grip on it with the fractured palm of his hand, and then bind it up with a long bandage. The splint should be of leather that is somewhat soft, so as to fit into all the folds of the palm; and bandage it on suitably.	0.8557921
And if the fracture is on the outside, you should place a splint on top and another underneath the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and secure the binding between the fingers.	But if the fracture be on the outside you will have to put one splint above and another beneath the palm of the hand, to keep the hand opened and straight; then put on the bandage, carrying it round the hand and in and out between the fingers.	0.8844259
And if the fracture is at any of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, set it evenly, as needed; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to stabilize the fracture, and prevent movement; and if the fracture is on other fingers, like the index or another, set it evenly, and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or bind them all together as one, which is better, or place a splint, as on the thumb; and monitor the restoration and the development of a hot abscess, and treat what arises, as I have said.	If it be the thumb, then set it in the proper way and bind it down to the palm of the hand; if you like you can apply a small straight splint to it to keep the fracture straight so that it does not shift. If the break be in any of the other fingers, such as the middle or index or little finger or the ring finger, straighten it out and bind it to the sound finger next to it; or let them all be bound up one to another, which is better; or apply a small straight splint, as we said for the thumb. While you are setting it, and afterwards, look out for an effusion and counteract it with what is required if anything of this sort occur, according to what has been repeatedly prescribed.	0.9135854
