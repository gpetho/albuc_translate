Chapter XXVII
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; it dislocates in all directions, mostly forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you as it is felt beneath the clothing or touch in whatever shape it is dislocated, and when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clear to you, as the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch the muscle with it.
You must act quickly and reduce the dislocation before it becomes an inflamed abscess, for if it turns into an inflamed abscess, it is difficult to reduce, and it does not heal easily; especially when it is backward, as it is the worst type of dislocation, with the most pain, and often leads to death.
The restoration, when it is possible to reduce, is done by extending the hand with both hands, and the arm stretched out, with the doctor's hands on the elbow above and below, pushing the joint with the thumbs together, or with the palm's edge until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, then it is returned by bending the hand with one's own hand until the elbow is struck with the palm's edge.
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.
Two assistants should extend the arm, holding it firmly so it is not moved during the extension.
Then the arm should be turned in all directions after being wrapped in a long cloth or bandage.
When the doctor touches the joint with their hand, they should oil it to facilitate lubrication and ease, then push the joint forcefully until it returns.
After reduction, a poultice with astringency and drying properties mixed with egg white should be applied, bandaged tightly, and the arm suspended from the neck, left for several days.
Then it should be unwrapped; if the joint is stable in its place, the bandage can be removed and left off.
If the joint does not seem stable, reapply the poultice and bandage, leaving it for several days until it stabilizes; then unwrap it again.
If heaviness occurs after joint reduction, and movement is difficult, administer moistening baths, gentle rubbing, and compression until relieved; or apply fat-tail sheep’s rump, which is very fatty, to the joint; bandage it, and leave it on the bone day and night.
Then remove it, bathe the joint; when dry, rub it with gentle friction, and reapply the fat-tail sheep’s rump, doing this once, twice, and three times,
the corruption has already come over the knee from the bath entry, until it is smooth.
If you wish, apply a humid and heated cow's spleen to the joint, pressing it on; do this several times, as it is moist and helps restore its condition.
