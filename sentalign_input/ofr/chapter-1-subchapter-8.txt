of lethargy
For this illness it is necessary to give the patient strong herbs and pills cleansing the brain; afterward shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the occiput a mustard plaster, which is described in the treatise on plasters; and this is the method of cauterization: apply it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, good; and if not, then make three cauteries from the middle of the head descending down to the neck, and have a space between each cautery of one finger's width; and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add to it, and the patient is tolerant, make a cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and treat it until he is healed; and let the cautery be the one called "olive-shaped", as I have said before.
