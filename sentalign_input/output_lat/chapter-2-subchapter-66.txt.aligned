On flatulent hernia.	On a windy rupture.	0.6356195
I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture.	In this rupture, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with surgery.	0.7818588
The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down. Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away. And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.	And the first ones indeed said that it is done as we described in the rupture that involves the scrotum. That is, to tie the vessels below the section with ease: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it until the vessels fall away: and treat the wound, as we said, until it is healed.	0.7981033
