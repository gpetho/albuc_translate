On the treatment of ectropion that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This ectropion, which occurs below, is what is truly called ectropion.  It may be natural or accidental.  The accidental type occurs from a wound, a laceration, cauterization, or the like.
The method of operating is to take a needle with a double thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus, until the thread is at both edges of the flesh. Then pull the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then [stop]. Otherwise, take a probe, place it on the location of the incision, and turn the eyelid with it. Make two incisions on the inside of the eyelid, with the ends of the incisions starting from the corners of the cut that you made, until they meet, forming an angle.
So that when they are joined, their shape resembles this form:.
Which is the Greek letter lambda. Then remove the flesh, making the acute angle lower than the eyelid. Then join the separated parts with two sutures using wool thread. Then treat it with the softening medications and bandages we mentioned until it heals.
If the ectropion resulted from an incision, a suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision, again below the eyelashes as described before, then separate the two lips [of the wound] with bandages as we mentioned.
In summary, the treatment of ectropion, whether upper or lower, should be carried out according to the form the ectropion takes, as it can vary greatly in appearance.  The experienced practitioner will devise a strategy by whatever means possible.
Until the form is restored to its natural state, or close to it.  The condition itself, in most cases, will guide you to the appropriate action and instrument.
