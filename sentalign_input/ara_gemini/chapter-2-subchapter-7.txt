Chapter seven on the treatment of sudden blockage of the ear.
Some children may come out of their mothers' wombs with the pores of their ears not perforated.
Also, some people may experience a blockage in the ear canal due to an injury or flesh growing in it.
This blockage may be in the depth of the ear hole, imperceptible to sight.
It may also appear slightly outside the hole and be perceptible to sight.
So the one that appears in the depth of the ear and is not perceptible to sight is, in most cases, difficult to see.
And the one that is perceptible to sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and look into it.
If you see the blockage apparent, open it with a delicate scalpel, which has this shape:
Its tip should have some slight, limited width, and the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear.
If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with delicate forceps and cut it very gently until all the flesh is extracted.
If the blockage is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, along with the patient's experience of hearing difficulty, rub it gently with the probe, being careful not to injure the eardrum. Then, place a wick in the ear, sized according to the width of the opening, having coated it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound will not close up.
Or, take a wick, moisten it in water, sprinkle powdered vitriol on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot swelling, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another wick that you have coated in a cerate made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides, then continue treating it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, place it on the ear, and use the rest of the treatment that stops bleeding, as mentioned in the chapter on ear drops.
