Chapter Twenty-Five on the Reduction of the Dislocation of the Clavicle and the Tip of the Shoulder
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest.
It may dislocate outward, and that is apparent to the senses.
Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms, then you press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return.
Then you put on it the bandage and the supports and tighten them.
As for its end, which is next to the shoulder and connected to it, it does not dislocate except rarely.
If it ever dislocates, then it should be reduced and adjusted as we have mentioned and as is possible for you.
Then put on it the bandage, the supports, and the tightening, and instruct the patient to maintain rest and stillness until he recovers.
With this same treatment, you reduce the end of the shoulder if it also moves from its place.
