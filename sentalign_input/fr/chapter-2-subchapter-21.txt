About the rupture of the uveal tissue
When ruptures occur in the uveal tissue, it becomes visible and protrudes from the eyelids like a grain of resin, which is frightening to see; then, if you want to cut it, the procedure is that you place a needle in the root from the lower part to the upper part, then place another needle with a double thread from the tear duct side; and make it pierce through, and leave the first needle in place; then cut the area with the double thread and tie a part of the uvea around, and compress it well, then remove the needle and place wool moistened with egg white on the eye; and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea, then treat the eye with strengthening substances until the wound is healed; and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvea on each side of a circle of cloth until it is healed.
And if the eye appears greatly, then pierce it with a delicate spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, and let the white moisture flow and the eye will descend, and immediately enter back in; then extract it until it is healed.
