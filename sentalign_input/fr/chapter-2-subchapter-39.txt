Of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I said in the division, by the treatment of medicines; and when this does not work, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you press the tongue with the instrument I told you about. And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps suitable for this. And if this does not work, take a tube with a wide end, and insert it into the patient's throat, then insert a hot iron at the end of the tube, and do this often. And let the patient drink water all day. Then take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafetida, using the instrument I mentioned in the fumigation of the uvula; do this many times, for it will fall off without delay. And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot with live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid with a hole in the middle, and in that hole is the head of the instrument; then add your fumigation, and the patient places the head of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but goes to the leech; and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall, repeat the fumigation many times; and let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty and garlic things, and not drink any water; and then it will be necessary for it to come out by this method.
And the form of the instrument to extract the leech, when it can be seen, is like curved forceps to easily enter the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a rough surface like a file, so that what it grabs, it cannot let go; and here is the form:
