Ugly pustules may erupt on the body from cold, thick, and corrupt humors. It is necessary, upon their first appearance, to cauterize the head of each pustule gently with a myrtle stick whose tip has been ignited with fire or with the root of long birthwort or with a lentil-shaped cautery.	Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter. When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.83877355
Warts may also be cauterized upon their first appearance in this manner, and they will not grow larger.  The excess matter causing them will dissipate, and the patient will recover. However, it is necessary that this be done after the patient has undergone bloodletting.	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them. But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.81552744
