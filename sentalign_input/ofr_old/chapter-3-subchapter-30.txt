Of the dislocation of the spine of the back  
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly follows the patient.  
And the signs are that the excretions escape without control, and cannot be held, and often some limbs are paralyzed, either both thighs or both arms or one.  
And often the spine moves in four directions; the one that moves backwards is called "kyphosis."  
The treatment is to see if the kyphosis came from childhood: then there is no cure or complete healing.  
And the one that comes from falling or impacts or similar causes, the ancients gave methods of treatment with long explanations, but not all are greatly effective.  
But I have shortened it according to my understanding, and have created instruments in various ways.  
I say that in the kyphosis that comes to the chest in front, there is no remedy or healing.  
And also the one that comes directly on both sides, and can only be treated if it is specifically on the back, as I say.  
And it is that the patient is stretched on his stomach on an even surface, with padding underneath so he is not hurt.  
Then drive a stick firmly into the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a band under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles.  
And two assistants pull the bands, one at the head and the other at the feet, through the two sticks.  
And let the sticks be well secured as we have said, and the practitioner places his palms on the spine firmly until it returns.  
And if it does not return by this method, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and the patient lies on his side, and place the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine.  
And the practitioner places his feet on the other end of the board, and presses well until it returns to its place; and if you want, do it with a hand-operated winch.  
And this is to drive two sticks at the head of the patient, one arm's length apart, and two others towards the feet, and between each stick, above and below, a palm's width apart.  
And each stick has a hole, where the winch turns, and let the sticks be firmly in the ground so they do not move; and between each two sticks have a rotating stick, where the bands turn, and have on each rotating stick two small sticks a palm's length, to turn the winch.  
And then tie the band around the armpits to the winch at the head, and the other band to the winch at the feet, and each assistant turns his winch with the band, and the practitioner sets the spine straight as we have said.  
And when it is straight, apply a drying plaster with egg white, then padding, then a splint of a small board three fingers long, covering the kyphosis area and the healthy part of the spine, then tie it with a band as we have said, and let the patient use subtle nourishment until it is healed.  
And if something arises at the end of healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint we have mentioned before; and sometimes a piece of lead is applied.  
And sometimes the appearance of a protrusion in the back vertebra of the spine occurs, and it is thought to be a dislocation; but it is the bone that is protruding, therefore one should not presume: it could possibly lead to death.
