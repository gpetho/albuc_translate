On the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a person suffers from chronic hemicrania (migraine), or acute catarrh due to sharp humors, and there is warmth in the muscles of the temples, or they have old and severe conditions like this, and medical treatments do not bring relief: then we have tried in such cases either the extraction of the arteries from the temples or their cauterization, as we have previously described.
The procedure for extracting them is as follows: the patient should shave the hair on the temples, then focus on the artery that appears in the temple.
This artery will show itself to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people or due to extreme cold.
If it is hidden, then the patient should bind their head with any cloth available, and then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Or, steam the area with warm water until it becomes clearly visible.
Then take the spatula that I have previously described.
Then peel back the skin gently with it until you reach the artery.
Next, insert a hook into it and pull it upwards, lifting it out of the skin, and free it from the membranes surrounding it on all sides.
If the artery is thin, then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut off a portion of it to the extent that the ends will retract and contract, and blood flow does not occur.
For if it is not incised and if it is not cut off, blood will not fully drain.
Then evacuate from it about six ounces of blood, down to three.
If the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with a strong double thread, either silk or cotton threads, so that decay does not reach it before the wound heals, and blood does not flow.
Then cut the excess portion that lies between the two ligatures.
Do this at that moment, or an hour later.
And if you wish, cauterize it down to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery iron: until the ends are seared, which will hold in place by the same procedure.
This is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament.
For the cautery is among those things that help to stop moistures.
Therefore, it is the better assistance.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the site should be filled with old cotton, and neatly made compresses should be placed over it.
And after the dressing is removed, it should be treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with linen cloths, until it heals.
If during the operation a flow of blood occurs from the artery, quickly stop it with a cautery or fill the area with lint; press your hand until the bleeding stops.
If none of these are at hand, place your finger over the area until the blood clots.
Then bathe the area with very cold water until the intensity subsides, and bind it as needed.
And a simpler and easier alternative to artery extraction is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, which has two blades: the sharpness of both blades should be like almagdatem (almagda stone).
However, they are far less sharp than two knives.
For if they are as sharp as two knives, both become cold quickly and do not cut flesh swiftly.
Since they have some thickness, they retain the heat of the fire and cut flesh swiftly; therefore, this method is better, lighter, and easier than any other.
Let the space between the two blades be about the thickness of a finger, after marking two spots with ink: then place both very hot blades until they reach the bone, cutting the vein in two places, so that it lengthens between the ends.
For they do not heal completely with this cautery.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
