On cauterization of the womb.	On the Method of Cauterizing the Uterus	0.6253917
When matter arises in the womb from chill or humidities and she is thereby prevented from conceiving and her menses are upset; their flow fails or, as they pass, pain accompanies them; then you must cauterize her three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in cauterization of the bladder; and once or twice in the lumbar region in the lower part of the back over the hips. The cautery should be claviform.	When cold and moisture affect the uterus, preventing conception, causing menstrual irregularities, delays, and pain upon menstruation, it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as described in bladder cauterization. Apply an additional cautery over the pubic region below the back, or use two cauteries, and use the nail-shaped cautery.	0.75797117
