Chapter 33.	CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE.	0.63040406
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.	On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.	0.9093659
The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes it is completely dislocated, either inward or outward.	The ankle is sometimes slightly displaced, sometimes fully dislocated, the dislocation being either internal or external.	0.90659195
The sign of dislocation is that you will see the heel swollen towards the direction it is dislocated.	The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen, and projecting on the side to which it is dislocated.	0.82223296
The treatment for a slight displacement is a gentle reduction, extending it easily with the hands until it returns.	As to the treatment of its displacement, the reduction of it is easy: if it is gently extended with the hands and straightened, it will go back.	0.6816441
For a complete dislocation, have the patient sit straight, with a strong assistant supporting their back from the middle.	As to treatment when it is dislocated completely, you should make the patient sit upright with a strong and sturdy assistant holding him about the middle from behind.	0.80511683
Hold the upper part of the foot with your right hand and the lower part near the ankle with your left hand.	Then hold the dorsum of the foot with your right hand, and with the left grasp the foot from below about the heel.	0.8020353
Pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, and then extend it with the left; push the sole of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without effort.	Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand, then with the left, twice. Then extend it with the left hand and thrust the metatarsus with the right hand without violence toward the leg.	0.87678164
Do this twice as we have described.	Do this as we have described, twice.	0.96617657
Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg a third time, focusing on the ankle.	Then thrust the metatarsus toward the leg a third time while exerting traction at the heel.	0.79673135
If the foot returns to its place once or twice in this manner and appears aligned, it is good; if not, repeat the procedure until it does.	If it goes back in one or two attempts thus, and you see the foot is straightened, well and good. If not, repeat the operation and it will go back.	0.8157401
But if you are unable to reduce the dislocation as described, lay the patient on their back on the ground, secure a block firmly to the ground, and place it between their thighs, wrapped with cloth to avoid injury.	If you find it impossible to reduce it by what we have said, make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly fix in the ground between his thighs a stake wrapped in material so as not to hurt him.	0.8051701
Then one assistant holds the thighs, and another extends the foot with their hands or with a band tied around the ankle; each assistant pulls in opposite directions, while the block between the thighs holds the body steady to prevent it from being pulled down during the extension.	Then an assistant should grasp his thigh and another assistant should extend the foot, either manually or with a cord tied round the narrow part of it; the assistants should pull one against another, with the stake upright between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body will not be dragged down with the extension.	0.86316925
The physician aligns the dislocation with their hands, while another assistant holds the healthy thigh downward, allowing the dislocation to return easily.	Then the doctor should straighten out the dislocation with both hands, while another assistant holds down the sound leg; then the dislocation will speedily go back.	0.7912068
Once the dislocation is reduced and confirmed, apply a poultice and bandage it tightly, binding the foot to the leg.	Then when the dislocation is reduced and the soundness of the reduction is manifested to you, apply a plaster and packing, bandage firmly and bind the foot downwards.	0.7823088
Take care to avoid compressing the nerves behind the heel too forcefully to prevent damage.	You will have to be careful of the tendon above the ankle at the back, not to bandage tightly over it so as to injure it.	0.74005115
Leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it.	Then leave him for two or three days; and if the binding works loose, tighten it up.	0.9013749
Remove the bandage on the third or fourth day, and prohibit walking for 40 days. But if walking is necessary before this time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not recur and worsen, preventing proper healing.	Then on the third or fourth day loosen it, but the patient is to abstain from walking for forty days, for if he tries to walk before this lapse of time you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not collapse and corruption set in and thereafter be incurable.	0.82559586
If an abscess occurs, treat it as previously described in another place with appropriate care and embrocation until it subsides.	If an abscess occur you must allay it by the application of such dressings and embrocations as we have already described more than once, until it is gone.	0.70722485
