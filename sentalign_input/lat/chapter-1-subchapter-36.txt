On the Method of Cauterizing a Fistula in the Anus
Chapter 38.
When a patient is unwilling to undergo surgery and the procedure we discussed earlier, and if they are afraid of it, perhaps they can be cured with cauterization.
When someone has a fistula that has persisted for a long time, and pus and corrupted humors flow from it.
First, it is necessary to examine the fistula carefully with a fine probe.
Then, assess its depth with the probe.
Afterward, heat a rod-like cautery.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula to the depth of the insertion mark.
Repeat the cauterization over the affected area until all the corrupted tissue is burned, doing this once, twice, or thrice, depending on the need.
Be cautious not to burn any nerves, if present, or major veins. If the fistula is near the bladder or intestines, take care to avoid these areas entirely.
Only perform this procedure when the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it does not penetrate deeply.
Then treat the area until it is fully healed.
If the area seals and discharges material for an extended period, this indicates complete healing.
If it fails to discharge material, then know that the fistula may be deep, possibly involving decayed bone or similar structures, which will be discussed later.
