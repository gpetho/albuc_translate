On the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and headache occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleared with cleansing medicines, and the rest of the treatment I mentioned in the divisions of ailments is applied and still does not help: then cauterization is done in one of two ways: either with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
The cauterization with sharp burning medicine involves taking one clove of garlic, peeling it, and cutting off its ends on both sides.
Then make an incision at the site of the pain with a broad lancet, until there is a place under the skin where the clove can fit.
Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden: next apply a pad with appropriate pressure over it, and leave it for about fifteen hours, then remove it, extract the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterward, place a cloth soaked in butter over it until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, perform it with certain burning medicines that I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization with iron is done in this way.
Heat the cautery tool, which has this form.
It is called the "Clauilis" because the shape of its head resembles a nail, with a slight curve, and in the middle of it is a small protrusion.
Then place it on the spot, hold your hand steady, and gradually rotate the iron with speed; let the amount burned from the skin thickness be about half of it.
And lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burned, causing a flow of blood.
Then soak a cloth in salt water, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place a cloth with butter on it; afterward treat with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the blade tip of the second cautery.
And be careful not to cut the artery in this hemicrania, as it is not a typical case.
