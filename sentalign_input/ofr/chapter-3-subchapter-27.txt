Of the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and with difficulty returns; and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially forward and backward, and the dislocation is not hidden, for it is easily seen and felt; and dislocates according to each position.
And when you compare the injured elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly.
For the joint is locked, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reduce it before a hot abscess develops, because if a hot abscess were to develop, it would be difficult to reduce; and perhaps it cannot be reduced completely, especially when it is backward; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and perhaps death results.
And the restoration, if it is such that it can be reduced, is that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arm should be extended, and the physician's hands around the elbow, above and below, and push the joint together at the base of his thumb or at the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is forward, it returns when he folds his hand over, and strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of the palm.
And if it does not want to return to its place, apply strong traction; two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold him so that he does not move during the traction; then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth around it; and when the physician has grasped the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly until it returns; and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm around the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then untie it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it; and if you see that the joint is not tight, reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is firmly set; then untie it.
And if he feels severe pain after the reduction of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and compress it until the pain subsides; or you can put a fatty sheep's caul on the joint, then leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and have him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint temperately, then put the caul back on, and then have him enter the bath; and do this two or three times, until he is healed; and if you wish, apply warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on; it will return to its normal state.
