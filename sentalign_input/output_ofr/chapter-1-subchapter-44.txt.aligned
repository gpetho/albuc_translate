When joint pains are from humors that are spread to each limb of the body, and when the pain comes in the feet, which doctors properly call "gout," and when it is from a cold cause and treatments with medicines cannot cure it, it is treated by cauteries in this way:	When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'.
