Chapter Nine
On Cauterizing for Hemiplegia and General Bodily Weakness.
It is necessary to begin by purifying the head with irises and what we have mentioned, then shave the patient's head. Then cauterize him with a cauterization in the middle of the head, a cauterization on each "horn" of the head, and a cauterization on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck.  If you need, in the case of general bodily weakness, more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is severe and persistent, cauterize him with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back.
Cauterize deeply so that you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand. Treat him according to what was mentioned previously until he recovers, God willing.  And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped.
