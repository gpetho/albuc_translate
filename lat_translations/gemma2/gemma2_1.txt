Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed this book for you, O sons, which is the last of medical knowledge with its completion, and I have come to an end in it, from its expositions and its pronouncements, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Tractate which is a part of surgery, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because surgery with the hand is in our region and time entirely absent; until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its trace was cut off: and there remained from it, except for small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and error and hesitation happened to them, until their intentions were closed and the strength of theirs was elongated. It seemed to me, that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on its path according to the way of exposition, and declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with the forms of instruments of cautery, and the rest of the instruments of work: when it is made from the addition of declaration, and from the preparation of it that is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The cause for which a good artificer of this craft is not found with his own hand in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be exercised before that in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the connections of the limbs, and their forms, and their joining together, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their egress, and the pulsating veins, and the quiet ones, and the places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	Now indeed we have spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because he who is not learned about what we have said of anatomy, does not evacuate himself from error, into which men are killed: as I have seen many of those who make themselves from this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is because I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess on the neck of a woman and he injured some arteries in her neck; therefore blood flowed from the woman until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed to remove a stone from a man who was advanced in years, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore it came to him, and he extracted it with the fragment of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had been called upon to remove it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land because of medicine: and it happened to an eunuch, black in color, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with splints, and straps tightly fastened, and did not allow the wound's discharge.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he completed it according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterward he dismissed him after several days, and commanded him not to untie the ligature. And he stood thus until the abscess came on his leg, and his foot, and it arrived at destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	Therefore I was called to him; and I hastened to loosen the ligament; and there followed tranquility, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, when corruption has ceased to spread in the limb until it has perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who lanced a cancerous abscess; and it became ulcerated after days, until the malignancy of it had increased with its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to come to it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you to know that an operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with health; and the operation, with which there is peril in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have now roused myself in every place of this book, where an operation comes, that there is fear and terror.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you, that you beware of it and halve it: so that the foolish may not find a way to speak and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, receive measurement with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by the grace of God to health and a praiseworthy succession: and dismiss terrible illnesses difficult to heal: and take your souls away from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon you in your faith and your advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	It is indeed more remaining for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen indeed said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now however this Treatise is divided according to three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cautery with fire, and cautery with sharp medicine, a chapter organized from head to foot, including the forms of instruments and cautery tools: and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On incision and piercing, bloodletting and ventosing, and wounds; and the extraction of arrows, and things similar to these; and the whole chapter, arranged according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On the restoration, and dislocation, and cure of torsion, and similar things of this sort: a chapter, arranged from the head to the feet, and with forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Book of Surgery of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the benefit and harm of cautery: and what temperaments it is suitable for, and at what time; and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Book I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we remember the operation with him, it is necessary that I say the quality of his benefits and harms, and in what complexion they are shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	Therefore I say that the discussion on the quality of cautery and its use is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Even many wise men spoke on it, and disagreed about it: and to me indeed, a little from their speeches suffices, fearing the prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	Therefore I say that cautery applies universally to every constitution, which is with matter and without matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitution without matter, and dry constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In a heated and moist complexion they disagreed with the matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some say that a cautery is helpful in this.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of this, namely that cauterization is not suitable in illness which is from heat and dryness; because nature is heat, and it is unsuitable that healing should come from a hot and dry ailment with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of this said: that cauterization provides benefit in every ailment hot and dry that happens to the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of man, and its humidities, to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his speech: because from experiment already he has detected it to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Nevertheless it is not proper that he should come to this, unless he has already been proven and exercised in the chapter on Cauterization in the final exercise, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the space of time for them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	There is no fear of these remaining complexities, especially in cold and wet ailments.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all physicians have come together on these things, and they did not disagree in treatment with cautery on them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and the goodness of it over cautery with burning medicine is this: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the member which is cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined with it, unless with slight harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning medicine, however, comes to that which lengthens from the limbs; and perhaps it causes to happen in the limb a pain difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now it has become known to us through experience, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing above the truth of things: and for this I excuse myself from the length of the speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it is not so, because it does not permit this book of mine to bring to you a hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, which expels illnesses with a philosophical and demonstrative speech, which would agree with your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is proper to perform cauterization, and they place a better time for truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm that happens because of time is submerged in the benefit which is drawn with cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is because of pains from necessary pains, strong, swift ones that do not tolerate slowness; therefore it is feared from them that an evil might happen which is greater than the small harm passing in time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it come to mind, O sons of mine, that which is thought by the vulgar and foolish physicians, namely that in those illnesses which are cured by cauterization, there is never a return; and they place this as a consequence, but it is not so as they think: because cauterization is, except for medicine, which alters complexion, and dries up humors which are causes, therefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is superfluous over medicine because of the speed of its health, and the virtue of its operation, and the strength of its dominion: and it is possible that illness may return at some time, according to the constitution of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and the virtue of it: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities therein: and what comes to him in its acquisition from foods, and similar causes, unless an illness occurs, in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A slight pain in a limb with few redundancies and humors, like toothache, because of the pain, and similar to it, for it is possible that the pain does not return there.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this is done in a few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But again the common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine is a correct statement: not to that which they intend in it; because they believe that it is not a cure that can compare with medicine, nor with anything else after the occasion of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is contrary to this, and the intent, that cautery is the last of medicine, is not, except when we administer ways of healing in some illness, and those medicines do not help: then at the end of the matter we administer cautery, and it helps: therefore it falls, that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than a cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance, and they said that it does not make pus the place of cautery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But it is not absolutely true: because I have already tested it and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cauterizing iron with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However when you heat the cauterizing iron in the fire from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the quantity that you wish, because of the redness of the gold; and when it hastens toward itself cold, and if you add on top of it ignition, it melts in the fire, and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore the artificer falls from that into the work: and because of this, cautery with iron among us is more quickly and closely done, from straightness to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed arranged this Chapter on cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged them from the head to the feet; so that they may relieve whoever seeks it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	On the manner of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This application of cauterization pertains to the dominion of humidity and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of headaches, and the multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally all illness, which happens from cold, such as paralysis, and headaches, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you instruct the sick person to evacuate first with a cleansing liquid medicine, three nights or four, according to what is required by the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then command him to make a cut on his head with a knife.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands, in a square manner, so that he has placed his hands over his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger shall reach, mark that place with a markless one.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then cautery with oil fire: whose form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with an untied bandage, a descent, by which your hand will gradually be constricted, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already exposed from bone the quantity of alkiel, or the quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another one from it if it cools down: until the bones which I told you about appear.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it on the wound, and place it over the spot: and let it stand for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place on top of it a cloth soaked in butter and let it lie over the place until the fire's scald is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment of four drugs, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus, wherefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone, and that the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is scraped after that which has been burned from the bone, then it is cared for.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary that with a cauterizer one should arrive at the last part, so that it imprints in the bone a form, so that the bone falls, which is done like the shape of a kirate: or an instrument that women put in the infusion of small alphabet letters: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and that the wound is dismissed open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, these two kinds of cautery do not seem to be anything but in some men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to release him, in my judgment it is better for his health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other members, and especially when the head of a weak patient is naturally feeble. And indeed, the first kind of cautery is more safe and better for me, and I use it; therefore operate with it in safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	On the manner of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head: and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses  hyenas, and cauteries, and head purges, and oils, and emplastrum.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have narrated, and nothing benefits from those: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	If the head of the sick person is of strong constitution and not weak, and finds extreme cold, then cauterize with a different cautery beneath it a little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over every horn of its head with a cautery, so that it does not pass through the skin, and discover from the bone the quantity which we have narrated.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with a cautery one on the back of his head, in the place which is called uas: and it is the place where a ventouse is placed: and raise your bandage there, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	He found that the patient was suffering because of this violent pain, and different from the pain of other cauterizations on all parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I shall say this concerning the cautery: and it ought to be a cautery which is used for cauterizing the horns of the head, and the nape of the neck with a finer cautery than that which is used for cauterizing the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	On the manner of cauterizing in headache, both with medicine applied hot, and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in the head region, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the rest of the treatment is administered, as I have said in the divisions of ailments, and this does not suffice entirely: then cauterization in it is according to two modes: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	A cautery with a sharp and burning medicine is, to take one tooth from another, and to scrape it, and to cut off its extremities on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the place of pain with a broad surgical knife until a place under the skin is made where the tooth can be grasped.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore introduce it into the skin itself until it is hidden; then tighten above it with a small ligature of decent constriction, and let it remain for fifteen hours, then release it, and remove the other one, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterward put upon it a cottum submerged in butter, until the place makes pus; then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do it with certain medicines that burn, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	The cauterization thereof with iron, is according to this mode.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Burning cautery, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called Clauis: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a key, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it over the location and hold your hand: and you revolve the iron gradually with speed: and let the quantity which is burned be as thick as half its thickness.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand so that the artery which is below does not burn, and let there be a flow of blood.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then drink a cloth in salt water and put it on the place, and let it be for three days; then put the cloth with butter: afterwards care with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the secondary edge of the scalpel Cauterii.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting an artery in this headache, not properly an old one.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	On the method of cauterization in ancient headache.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a headache, with that which we have said from the previous treatment, and that which we have said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help the treatment: and you see from the illness, that what we said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, is insufficient, then it is necessary to use the Cauterium cultellare fire until it whitens after marking signs over the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about such: and lay your hand vice one, and squeeze it until you cut the artery, and reach up to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Nevertheless, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the jawbone, which moves when chewing, lest it be burned on one side or the nerve that moves it, so that a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	Let there be care and caution of the flow of blood from the artery which is cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially to him who does not know what he is doing, and is neither studious nor experienced: and he puts aside the operation with this first of all.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I shall come with a remembrance of the regimen of blood flow accidents from an artery according to my manner, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from illness that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person enduring the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, take care of the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer a cautery, which we said in the chapter on artery extraction with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For indeed cauterization is better this way and more efficacious.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the manner of cauterizing in pain of the ears.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with solutiuis, and the rest of the cure which we said in the division, and the pain does not move, then cauterize with fire: and it is that which is called Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points with it after its ignition on the circumference of the whole ear, as it revolves; or on the circumference of both, if pain is at the same time in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with encaustic: and let the quantity of the cautery be ten pricks in every ear, and like this one.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then care for the places, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the manner of cauterizing in a torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torments that are cured with cauterization are not anything else but those species that occur from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of a species which occurs from drying and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torture with yarrow, and head purges, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the sick person with three cautery: one at the root of the ear, and a second slightly below its point, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, that you cauterize it with a cautery in the direct extremity of the upper earlobe under the corner of the head a little: and at another time: whose length shall be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cautery until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of a cautery, and it is a kind from a knife, whose form is given before: but truly it is not too subtle, as you see: and it ought to be a knife in it of superfluous thickness little.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place, as that which preceded: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the mode of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy has advanced and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment is ineffective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery at the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cautery shall be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and it is most final.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the sick person completely, and place on the back of his head a dressing of synapi as described in the treatise on dressings: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	This is indeed the manner of cauterization: and do it according to the same order which I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and put between each cautery the thickness of a finger.

Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If, however, you wish an addition, and the patient is weak and can tolerate it, then make for him a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish an addition: then cauterize it above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for it until it heals: and let the cautery be oiled according to the form which has been set forth.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over every horn of the head, and with a cautery over the back of it, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you need in the pain of softening the body with many of those things, and he is weak and enduring, and the sickness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries upon the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery, until it burns from the skin most of it, and elevate your hand.

Therefore, it is necessary that you cleanse the brain of him first with a pig and with the rest of the treatment which we have said in the division; when he is greatly weak or is tolerable in the reception of medicine.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If it is a boy who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing chewings for the brain are administered, before which many days with improvement of food.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is superfluity inclining to melancholy, and the body of the infirm person is wet, then give him in drink what will purify his brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the head of the infirm person, and make afterward a turban properly made of linen, like a circle.

Then cauterize it over both temples with two cauteries, if the onset of water descent is in both eyes at once; or from one side, if the onset of water is in one eye; and cut off with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see something of that kind, then immediately cut it away with whatever medicine is possible, and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and care from the flow of blood.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs are turned inward and pierce the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	A cautery is of two kinds: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	When using fire in cauterization, instruct the sick person beforehand to remove their hair, if they are among those who trim it, until it is lengthened and made equal.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they prick him at his birth place, then bind his eyes with a cloth so that they do not move until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are born and equalized, then place the head of the sick person in your bosom: then mark above the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a mark that is according to the figure of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a soaked pad in albumin of egg: or in slippery elm mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then a cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you have marked little by little in many parts until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, wholly appearing properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and hairs being removed at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore lift up your hand then, and dismiss him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over it a poultice with butter until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens; then apply the cautery again to that spot, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If hairs are in the lower [area]: then cauterize it, until it is raised to its natural place: and so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the mode of cauterization with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as you should instruct the sick person, that he let go of hair until they lengthen and equalize.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from cloth a shape like a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap, and from unsatured lime, each an ounce in weight or thereabouts; then rub those together well, and make it with haste so that it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then from a pad take from it onto paper which you made like the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth soaked in white of egg: and the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger upon the medicine, and press it for a little while.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you will move it as often as the sick man feels the bite of medicine; for he finds its bite like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While therefore he persevered in what he himself had invented, biting, then let go of medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the biting ceases, then remove medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid being raised, as it is raised with contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat on the same from medicine over the place, in which the medicine does not imprint, and does not blacken, until the operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the burnt skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment diaphanicum, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you at the operation, that you guard with the last care, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days and something from the hair fights in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to this, let your consideration be: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who has a study of this art.

When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not help; then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Tell the patient to put his head in your lap, and have an assistant hold his head between his hands so that it cannot be moved or agitated.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a poultice of boiled linseed or marshmallow on the white of the eye, and then apply fire cautery, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the form of a feather quill from one end, with which cauterization is performed; and if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish, let it be curved upwards.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then extract the fistula if it is open and remove the pus from it, and dry it out; and if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus from it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place upon it a cautery, which is heated greatly.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold with your hand a little by the cautery from the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or rest the sick man; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you come at the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then apply cautery once, or twice, if it needs it: and leave it alone for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place the cloth with butter on it, and care for it with a drying ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days pass and it does not heal, then place on top of it medicine sharp and corrosive, until the bone is uncovered, and smooth it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Attend to the place of the fistula, and find it: then place in that fissure a fine camel's hair, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a quantity of an ounce of lead melted down, and hold your hand with a good retaining cane, and do not move the sick man at all so that he may not run or the molten lead may come to his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you should place over the eye of the sick person a cloth soaked in albumen or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead indeed burns the place of fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed, as we have said from cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a hole in the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come into its own proper place.

Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of a gum or on the palate or at the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and ruptures; afterward it heals and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then cure this itself and treatment does not avail in it, then it is necessary that cautery with fire be applied according to the amount which it takes in the fistula.

Then immerse it in boiled butter: and place it upon the aching tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge wool or a cloth in cold butter and place it upon the aching tooth; and place upon it heated iron until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Cauterization of it with fire is, that you may apply it to a tube of air, or a tube of iron.

Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary in the pressing of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour; then he spits it out.

Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is burned be equal to the thickness of the skin, and the quantity of half of it not added; and let the patient stand weak on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.

When an abscess occurs, and you wish to know if it is in the liver flesh or its tunic; then if it is in the liver flesh, a dull pain invades the sick person, and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is vehement sharpness; and you see already that it has fatigued his physicians with treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, let the sick person lie upon his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the place of the abscess with an encasing; then fires cauterium which is assimilated to a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And burn it with one cautery until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the fascia, until all pus comes out; then take care of it with ointment treatment until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not right that this cautery be used unless the one who studies the art of medicine has prolonged their practice, and through whose hands these ailments have frequently occurred with experience; then he may dare to attempt such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But in my opinion it is better to discharge her.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the manner of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that a cautery with the roots of asarabacca was applied to cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And there is, that you receive from the roots of dried and long birthwort, one root longer, which is found in it, and be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and set it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery where the fork is joined to the neck, and with two small cauteries under a slightly sloping guide on the part which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping to the rear a little; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between two spatulas; and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, lower cautery which is between the two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you must not press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be on the manifest skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cauterio made of iron like a rod: and they ignite it, and put it inside where the ribs are, until it comes to the abscess, and pus flows out: just as we said in the case of an abscess on the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the weak one dies immediately or a fistula occurs in its place which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	On the manner of cauterizing the spleen.  Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we have said from the treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then cauterization in it is according to three ways, which are all right.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is that you make three cauteries, or four, by lining them according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the liver cauteries, which preceded in figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be among all cautery a quantity of thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of cautery be as we have said in the cautery of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the weak one be lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another way of cauterization is: that having a cauterium with two handles, which we said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and elevate the skin, which is directly on the spleen, where the elbow of the left arm arrives; and let your elevation be as you elevate the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two burning rods, until with them you penetrate the skin from the other part: then remove the cautery: therefore four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cautery having three handles.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauterization after you let it discharge pus for many days, for it is more healing than all that preceded from the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	On the manner of cauterizing in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	A cautery does not fall upon a hydropic condition unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat Hydrops with the methods of treatment which we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on top of the stomach, and another on top of the liver, and one cautery on the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one in a straight line across the chest, and another in a straight line across the stomach: and let the quantity of the depth of the cautery be near to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the open cautery so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the infirm from treatment after cauterization, for it is necessary that two intentions are brought together to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be a clamp, according to what precedes about its form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be an olive, according to what precedes about its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the mode of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When boils are treated on the watery [skin], and they are filled with citron water: it is necessary to cauterize over the top of the foot in the night area, which is between the auricle bone and the ring bone: and lift your hand with the cauterizer, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The acid water will suffice, and let the cautery be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make on each leg two cautery incisions, and let the cautery be made with the sharp edge of the knife, and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower in it, about the middle of the leg: and above each hip make two cauteries. And dismiss the open cautery without treatment for a long time, so that water will flow from it: then treat it with the rest which we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterization in the treatment of an abdominal wound.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a solution of the belly from cold and humidity, until it weakens the retaining and digestive powers that are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with modes of cure, and it does not heal: and you see the weak one enduring the cautery of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a great cautery over his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a subtle clauili cautery: and a cautery on the alcatin above the alhosos with a great one, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see abundant humidities and the weak one tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery on top of a comb, and cautery on all of it: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the stomach by the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a healing treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick humors, cold ones, or corrupted humidities, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not work: then cauterize with three cauterizations on the lower spine of the back, under a little bit shaped like a triangle, and with a cauterization under the navel, like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face suppurate, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery on his Epiploon, and another on his Spleen, with a caultery clamp: and release the open cautery after a while: then care for him until he heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of cauterizing a wound after its excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut the flesh, then apply fire cauterization that resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the burning one into the cut flesh and last of your hand until the cauterizing comes to the mouth of the vein, through which blood flows; do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the abscesses are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for that, with what it confers of ointment, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on linen, it is more final in healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the manner of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the incision and operation which we have narrated in its place, and fears it, perhaps he is healed with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore it happens to someone that they have a fistula, and it becomes old, pus runs out of it, and there are corrupt humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is proper that you examine it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then a burning cautery, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce yourself burning into the fistula itself and the quantity into which the nail has entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery over it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity of your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein: or if a fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless there is a fistula in a fleshy place, and you think that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time, then you will know that it has been healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not cut away the matter from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupted opening in its depth, or like those of which remembrance will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or thick wind, and it is diminished because of the weakness of the patient, then it is necessary to cauterize it above almethenem above the kidneys, with a cautery over the entire kidney with a cautery clamp, which preceded this recollection.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the very wound.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more useful in healing.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and moisture until it cannot hold weak urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the comb begin, and with one cautery from the right pubis, and another from the left of it: and let the length of this cauterization be according to the amount of a finger-knuckle, and cauterize it with a lower cautery of the back, or with two cauteries if you need it: and let the cautery be closed as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the Matrix.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When coldness and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented by this from conception, and its menstrual flow is corrupted, and its arrival is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the lower linen on the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be clauile.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the manner of cauterizing a joint in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucus humors are poured out to the Anchae point, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that one leg is lengthened over the other when they are compared adinuicem: and the place of dislocation is found in it empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary that the weak one be cauterized over the base of Anchae with a similar cautery circle; after you have marked with encaustic on the circumference of the base, just as it turns: and that the very base may fall in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let there be a cautery whose form preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-wood cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the amount of thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterization in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint and the cause is cold and moisture, and the sick person is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes old: then it is necessary to treat the sick person from gross humors with foul pills or artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the mode of cauterization in it is according to two modes: either cauterization with medicines that burn, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these is to cauterize over the pyxis of the anus with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make for them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	Let there be a space which is between every cautery of the thickness of a finger; let the cautery be oiled.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes a cautery is applied in the middle on top of the arch of the same (bone).
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: that it be a circle containing the entire hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin entirely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the mode of cauterization in sciatica when the pain adheres to the hip and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the hip, above the place where the sick man indicates, where there is pain, and with your cautery on the tail four fingers' breadth to the left part a little: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient states that the pain extends almost to the toes of his foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a cautery point, three, or four, or more, if it is needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates pain being under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a single knife cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations that you do not go to the extreme with the cautery so as to burn nerves or a large artery and draw through it an evil ill upon the weak, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have indeed seen one and another of those who cauterized above the groin, and continued in the cauterization, and the leg was inflated until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole was perforated and the whole foot corrupted; then there occurred a solution of the belly, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If there is pain in two parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said in cauterization of the anus, whose cautery this is the way.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a probe like a rod of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a finger's kernel, or a little less: and inside that probe let there be a third probe.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be a space which is between every ligature the quantity of a thumb's width: and let the ligatures be open from two parts: and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles: and make for them a handle out of iron fitted in the center in the ligatures.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is set on fire until it glows red and throws sparks; then it is placed upon the wax of the infirm limb laid on its sound side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three round cautery tools in one place.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let him be left undisturbed for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and let the open wound be left for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, on this kind of cautery, my sons, we have used it little, because of the fear of its appearance: and therefore, because we have found few who await it upon itself.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless it is good for those who suffer from it, and finds with it its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	But cauterium with medicinal things burning is, that you make two samia having perforated armilla, into which descends the hinge of its door from brass, or iron, length of the wall: of which the height of them are two knots, or as themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space that is between the two quantities the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let it be such that they contain themselves adjacent to each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it over the wax tablet, with the weak one lying on his healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand upon the resin of the cavity much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles hot water, which has been heated for a short time with fire, and keep it for an hour's time: and let the sick person endure its biting and burning, for he himself found the biting like fire until the biting subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the whole incision with sweet water; then leave it alone for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put butter on top of it until the blackness of the burn is removed; and let it sit for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last resort in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If pain extends to the hip or leg, make for him a position in that which contains water, according to what you have done in ancha equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unquenched quicklime, each one part. Grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity that will enter the radius: and place under the bottom of the pot another pot glazed: and pour over the alkali and quicklime from sweet water, so that both are submerged by a finger: after which you compress them with your hand good compression: and let go of the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glazed pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water and pour it over another lime mortar: and stir it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be a keen sharpness of great force which is administered in many operations of medicine and the cauterization of the remaining members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among medicines there are those with which wounds are cauterized, even as a sponge, and oil of cashew nut, and chalk mixed with soap, so that both may be mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed narrating recounted, of a certain man from ancient times the cure, by which he was cured of pain in the hip and sciatic vein: and magnified it to be truly great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because he did not need other treatment, and because he was healed from one vice until he returned, because perhaps he himself had entered the bath carried in, and came out of it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is, as to be taken from the seitaragi green: and if not found green, take dry, fresh: and arranged much with a little fat, and put upon an ache, where there is pain, or leg, or in the hip: and bind it, and let it go for a quantity of three hours, or for a quantity that the sick person feels sedation burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore the body is made wet, introduce it into the socket.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain departs, and it is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not right for someone to use a cautery with these medicines unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that the dung of goats, when it is cauterized with a vein, helps it; and the cautery is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool and soak it in old oil and place it over the deep spot which is between the little toe and the heel, and it is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and set it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place him upon wool, and let him alone until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat it.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore, do not cease doing this until you come to a sense through mediation up to nightfall, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called cautery Vaccinum.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from evacuation of excess, and those similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cauterization does not apply, except in this single kind, which is produced from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the evacuation of the sick person, with bitter pills and similar ones, let three lines be made on the back where there is pain, according to the width of the wound itself, after having marked signs with encaustic on each line five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity which comes from the endurance of the patient's strength: and let the cauterization be done with a cautery point.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medium-sized clamp cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the manner of cauterizing in an unhealed gibbosity.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often happens to small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in boys is that which occurs upon him constriction in breathing when elevated and in motion; and you find it in the last vertebra of the back and its knots, which has already begun to protrude above the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see that and wish to make that, then cauterize it with a cautery which is a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let him take the cautery over every part of the vertebra equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a cautery point two lines, or three: and let the points be close together in sequence.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place until it heals with what we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, lest you apply a cautery to the hump that occurs in a nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterization in gout, and joint pain.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains in the joints are from cold moisture which flows to any limb of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call that Podagra properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore gout is treated with cold causes and methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that you cauterize him after evacuation at the juncture of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be Oil-bearing.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the face of the foot, then make them with a cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pain rises as far as the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize the area above each knee with three or four cauterizations from every part, using the same cautery as Claudius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If you need more of this cauterization, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If however pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said from cauterization in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are in the hands only, then points on the circumference of the focus, as if two lines were revolving, .
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, above every node and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If pains should rise after days to the armpits, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the sick from good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	If a good regimen is followed and phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God and this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and intestine or part of the bowel descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to approach close: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to abstain from eating on his day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use soothing things so that feces may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back; and command him to hold his breath until it comes out, or the appendix appears, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with encaustic above the rupture on the bone of the breastbone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then the fire cauterizer, whose this form is, until it comes white and throws sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or rectum, to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant places his hand over the place so that the intestine does not escape: and you have already opened between the legs of the infirm, and placed a pillow under him, and one servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery over that mark, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it so until you obtain the bone with it; or if you have not succeeded with it in the first attempt, use another tool with it until you reach the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine at the hour of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and through it there may come over the weak either death or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not achieve the bone with the cautery, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be fine, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with the rest of the ointment, until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you put nourishment to him according to the length of time of his healing, which will soothe his stomach; so that it does not go out of the intestine at defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wishes to have surgery after forty days, then administer a bandage made correctly and let him keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should avoid labor, and overeating of food and drink, and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this treatment is used, it heals with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the cure of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning and you wish them not to increase, then cauterize the rupture with a rounded cautery according to its size; and let that which is burned from then be like one-third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for it as we have said: and nothing more shall be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some of the first said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with wax and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And lay your hand in the middle with the cautery closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But a cautery is first easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the manner of cauterization for pains caused by a fall, or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in certain limbs by chance or percussion, and that pain persists for a long time, and there is no help with medicine in it: then it should be cauterized with the point cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery for every member be a cautery according to its size, and its suitability, and its weakness, and its power, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat cauterization over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the custom of these pains, it is that they are changed from limb to that which is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery until the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the way of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Sometimes leprosy is helped with cauterization, to great benefit.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy, which comes from the rotting of phlegm and black bile: therefore when you wish to cauterize it consider this.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore leprosy is unrelenting, and you have treated it with that which we said in the division, and it has not descended, nor stood still; and you fear above the infirmity, that corruption may encompass the entire complexion of him: then cauterize him upon the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head noted, and a second below towards the forehead at the end of the hairs, and two upon the two horns, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And last your hand with a cautery briefly, until it imprints in the bone a small impression, and the cortices are separated from it: so that the expelling of vapors gross may be alleviated from it, and cauterize also the spleen above it, as preceding.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If leprosy has already spread over the infirm person and is manifest: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which we have said in the beginning, and one cautery on the extremity of the nose, and two cauteries on the two maxillae, and two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the buttocks near the great tail and one above it, in the very middle: and two on the flanks; namely on every flank one, and two on the knees; one on every knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the forearms, and two on the tender parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of the fingers of his hands, and feet of his. And cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are on top of the heel bone, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the breastbone, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the hip.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cauterium, it is more helpful and more effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in cauterization as do those who are healthy, because the body of the former is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that they be cauteries in size and shape according to the members and joints; according to what has preceded from the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for a cautery from herb flour with honey, and the rest of the cure, until it heals.

Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize that numbed limb with cautery irons, according to what the size of the limb or its smallness merits.

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized to some kind of numbness that happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But he should not presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the egress of the moving nerves of the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the manner of cauterization in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LXI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis treats a wound and finds nothing of the medical arts in it; then he cauterizes over it with deep cautery for a short time, according to the quantity of thickness of skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	It does not seem right to me, because I fear that it would become an ulcer, and I have already seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the mode of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess and it is delayed in ripening, either because of an excess of matter forming it, or because of the age of the patient, when he is old and has little blood, or because of time, and the desire to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around it with small, many cauteries, puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then release it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it itself will hasten with ripening.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If you wish to make a perforation of it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And lay him down in the middle of Abulati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows weak, so that the flow may be relieved by the pure.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing in a bad corrosive.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A gnawing is nothing except for corruption in a moving limb, and it gnaws at itself, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosion in a place which can bear cautery with fire, then cauterize with much fire, small and large clamps, according to what is convenient for the place in which the corrosion is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the whole corruption, and let nothing of it remain at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then release him after three days, and place sulfur rubbed with oil on the cauterized areas until all scabs are eradicated, and all corruption is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for him with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days flesh is born healthy in its birth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply cauterization again over that which remains from the places corrupted.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine when corroding.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises in place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Nevertheless, cautery with fire is quicker healing; and I have already said cauterization of it with sharp medicine in the division: therefore take it there when it needs it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the mode of cauterizing in claws and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This pain often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a thick, purulent matter that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed a cautery among them is according to two modes: a cautery with fire, and a cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As much as it is with fire, let the cautery be concave like a feather of an eagle; that it be made of iron, according to the quantity that it contains of nail from every part; and let it have a fine edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the heated piece above the stake.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn the hand with a cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and let it alone for three days until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a poultice of willow leaves, crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will be removed from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a generative ointment of flesh until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then administer cauterium with hot water in them: and it is, that you take a tube from copper, or iron, or from the feather of an owl: and lay it upon a nail, or awl.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and roll it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the tube is impressed on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way deep, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait for an hour over the mordication of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for a claw is removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Thus do with them one after another, until you come over all who are in the body from among these.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are eradicated, with that which produces flesh from ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	On the mode of cauterization in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone has a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from another cause: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra with cauterization, and in his chest with cauterization, and over his stomach with cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor rests with a cautery of olive oil, and the health of coldness hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the manner of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul matter, that is, pustules, are expelled from the body of Albashir, which are made from corrupted thick materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, first of all, when they appear, let them be cauterized over the whole head of the pustule with a fine cauterizing iron made of myrtle wood, whose end has been set alight with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long asarone.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lens-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes the bowels are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase; and the excess is broken, making them whole, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	Nonetheless, it ought to be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterization in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often blood flow occurs from an artery that has been cut at a wound, which happens externally or at the incision of a boil, or cauterization of a limb, and similar to these: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place upon it your index finger: and press it very much, until blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing goes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place in the fire a small oil lamp burner and several of them in large numbers; and blow over them until they become well alight.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one, or a small piece, or a large piece, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and lay the cautery upon the very vein, after which you remove your finger hastily: and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with a finger from the artery's opening, and the fire is extinguished, then receive another cautery more quickly, from the cauteries which are prepared in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease doing this one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and that evil may happen upon the sick one.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to cut it off, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cauterizing iron, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when it is not extracted, with the extraction.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it may be tied with strong ligature thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they may be placed upon it with medicines of property, which are to separate blood, and it is tightened with a poultice compression decent.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But he who administers the excision of it with a bandage, and constriction with cloth, or position of burning things, and similar things, does not apply it entirely to him, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If this happens to someone and there is no physician present, nor medicine: then he should begin with the position of the index finger over the opening of his vein, as we have narrated, and constriction of it strongly, until blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger shall not be moved, from above it with cold water of vehement coldness always, until the blood freezes and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider what is needed from cautery, or from medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	The End of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Puncture, and Phlebotomy in Wounds, and Similar Matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have said in the First Chapter, all sickness in which it is convenient with fire cauterization and burning medicine, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed there heads from the crown to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same way: that the one seeking may have relief from his inquiry.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, it is necessary that you learn, oh sons, that in this chapter is found the thing which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And therefore it is necessary that greater caution be exercised in this, because in the operation which is in this chapter, many times evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision above an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or healing of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision above a stone, and similar things: from all of these tremor and fear are associated, and death falls in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, let not that fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes modes of men with modes of illnesses come to you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	From these is one who becomes angry with his sickness and death is light to him because of the vehemence which he finds from his infirmity and length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with pain comes fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among these there is one who gives his tibia and nourishes you with it, hoping for health, and his sickness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not right that you agree with him who comes to you from those, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	Let your caution be greater than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume about anything from that, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies among you that to which it arrives, a praiseworthy succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And take care in the healing of all your sick people, with prognosis and indication of what is appropriate for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	Therein, indeed, is aid for you over the acquiring of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I indeed have arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on cautery, from the neck to the feet: that your search for what you want from it may be eased, and for what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this ailment often happens to children at birth; or when a midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens also from a hidden cause that is unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I indeed did not see this illness in others than in children: and to every one whom of them I saw it hastened death: therefore it seemed good to me to dismiss the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself saw of these a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this humidity indeed is either gathered between the skin and bone: or is gathered under the bone over the fascia.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on that one, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a fissure in the middle of the head in width: and let the length of the fissure be like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore humidity is increased, and the abscess is greater, then place these two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if humidity is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open from every part; and water is depressed when you press it with your hand to the interior, and it does not hide from you; then you must make three fissures in the middle of the head, in this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten fissures with cloths and dressings.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then embroider it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligament, and care for the wound with a bandage, and ointment.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let go of tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And give the sick person every dry food with little moisture, until the limb is restored and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another way of making an incision is that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is on the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with an incision where the abscess and filling of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, that you do not cut the artery, and that there does not occur a flow of blood, and that the sick person may die from that flow with the evacuation of humidity.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When cataracts occur to someone's eyes or chest, and it becomes old, and medicine does not help: then the last cure in this is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to cut them, let the sick man shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the weak person bind his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And these places are places which are behind the ears depressed: and rarely it is hidden, except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then signs with a coating on both sides: and cut both with a spatula on both sides, the incision coming to the bone: and let it be across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce a spatula under the artery, and cut into it upwards with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is wounded, blood flows out with a pulsating outflow, which leaps inwards with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If, however, the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that measures from the ear quantify the amount of space three fingers' width.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then with a cauterizing iron, and follow up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which ought to be emitted from the blood is six ounces and perhaps you emit more from it, or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The whole thing according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and repletion of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if something remains by the bone from the cutting, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not happen; then tighten the wound with linen bandages.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man an old headache, or acute catarrh because of acrid humors, and heat in the temples, or an old, violent sore, and similar things: and he is treated with the ways of medical treatment, and it does not help; then we have experimented in these ailments extraction of the arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the mode of operation in extracting them is that the infirm one shaves the hairs which are on the temples, and applies to the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For indeed it is shown to you by its pulse, and rarely is it hidden except in a few men, or extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then let the sick person wrap their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or place the vapor with hot water until its appearance becomes manifest to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I formed a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then skin the flesh with it and ease until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw a hook into it, and draw it upwards until you have extracted it from the skin and made it emerge from the tissues beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is fine, then wrap it with the point of a hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the amount that the extremities of it extend and contract, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not struck and if it is not cut away, blood does not rise completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from blood six drachms, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a double, strong thread, of silk: or with cords of al-hohod, so that it does not quickly proceed to its own putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound, and that blood flow occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife-like cautery: until its ends are cut, and it will stand in place of that same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better to operate, unless if the sick person has a fever, or a heated complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is one of those things that help to end moistness.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is better healing.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries it is necessary that the place be filled with old cloth, and on top of this put little balls made neatly.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	After the dissolving it is to be treated with dry medicines which make flesh grow and with liniments until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If while you are operating blood flow occurs from an artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or as to fill the place with wax; and tighten your hand until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things are present for you, then place your finger on the location until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of vehement cold until the sharpness subsides, and be bound according as is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is, that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	Nevertheless, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	If they are sharp, like two knives, apply cold to both; and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When therefore there is a certain amount of thickness in them, heat of fire is applied to them, and flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the work is better, lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between the two knives be the quantity of thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with encaustrum: and lay both burning ones down, until they arrive at the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that the distance between its extremities may be lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For these are not entirely consolidated with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of acute and frequent flow of tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are continual tears and a flow of them from the veins which are above the skull externally, and nothing of medicinal treatment helps with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already red, and he feels in his forehead a crawling like that of ants: and his eyes are weakened, humid, so that even the hairs of them are corroded with corrosion; and his eyelids have been heated from the sharpness of the tears; then the ancients devised a treatment for them with this operation, and they named that treatment “with the Sword.”
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, as you instruct the sick person to shave the hair that is on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions on the forehead equidistant according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be as two fingers' width, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little shorter than the movement of the arms, and the third from the other part: and beware of the incision of the arteries which are on both sides. And extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all the incisions be the quantity of three fingers joined together: and let there be a piece of sponge prepared for you, or many dried cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula of two sharp extremities, whose following is the form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From an incision which is from the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and skin with it, the whole skin which is between two incisions, with the fascia, which is over the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do likewise from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this spatula, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a pointed scalpel, blunt on one side, sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side against the attached flesh with skin, and its blunt side towards the bone: and drive it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision shall continue until that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure of the incision a piece from boiled sheep's gut, and place over them pellets soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, dissolve the ligament, and administer a plentiful infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of basilica, and other things that heal wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	On the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs of the eyes from the interior parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When it happens to someone that acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs occur: and you see their eyes exhausted, small, and already weakened in appearance: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out of them, and there is a sharp, painful pain deep in the head, and a following sneeze: then take from these occurrences, that these matters and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And better treatment in them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, as you instruct the sick person to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, or elsewhere somewhat across its width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right: and let the incision be up to the bone; and extend your hand from the temples which move during chewing: until when the bone is revealed; and you shall dry all blood with sponges.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with a cauterized cow's gut, or with liniments from linen.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind it from above with poultices: and soak the poultices in wine and oil, so that a hot abscess may not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have dissolved it, and see that the hot abscess has already diminished: then it is necessary to cover the bone until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to be born: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	On the treatment of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Anything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid thing, such as water, vinegar, and things like them; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from those which do not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun; if therefore you see the stone, then distill into the ear something from bruised oil, or sesame.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze with condiment, and plug his nostrils at the entrance of sneezing, after which you place around the ear fragments from cloth, or wool, and extend the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this reason he often comes out with this cure.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, Pizigarolis fine splinters: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore he goes out with breathing hard, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a curved and fine hook of little duplication.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not exit through this, then make a tube out of metal, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole much, and fill what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there be no way for the wind except through the tube; then withdraw with your breath attraction forcibly.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Many times indeed it happens as we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If this does not work this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from viscus, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small amount: and put it at the end of the radius after you have enveloped it with a pad placed in the center: then introduce it into the ear opening easily, after you have dried the ear from humidity.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of incision is, that the surgeon first make an incision on the sick man's head; and draw out blood from him according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upward, and find a small fissure in the root of the ear among its fat in the depressed place itself: and let the fissure be lunar shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible to you.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the fissure with speed from your hour, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If something falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not obey you toward the exit, then take a thin, fine spatula, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the removal of that kind from grains which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear until you put it in many strips: then extract them with hooks, or with a subtle probe, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it is eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water which enters into the ear, it is necessary that the sick person should use sneezing with a condyle at first: and already filled his ear with some cooked sheep's wool: and is lying on that ear, in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin, soft, and heat them with fire for a short time, and let the sick person put one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, do not cease doing this with stone and stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now water comes out so that you take from papyrus or reed one, and insert one end into the ear: and set the other end on fire until it is burned as much as possible.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another hook and do this many times until all the water comes out; and remove it with a tube as was previously said in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that has entered it, if it is small in body, such as a flea, and similar to it, care for it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the sense: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its business is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears there from worms, then remove it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, which has this shape, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the slender end into the ear according to the quantity that the weak one tolerates it; then suck with it strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you for an exit, then wrap a tube with wax, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we have said: then administer distillations which ancient men have already experimented with in the destruction of worms: and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring of oil and medicine into the ear be with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore let it be that which is driving in the cavity of the cannula, be made of well-centered bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a ray and wrap its end in a cloth with a decent wrapping; then project oil, or juice, or whatever you wish of these medicines into a tube; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the ray with the cloth from above, and express it with your hand moderate compression until the oil is driven into the cavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside; and what is poured into the ear, should already have been heated with fire for a short time; and beware that it does not become something very cold which distills into it; for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of an accident of the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes some infants come out of their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that an obstruction occurs in the passage of the ear from a wound, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this suppuration sometimes occurs deep in the ear's foramen, which is not reached by sight; and sometimes it happens to the external opening of the foramen a little, and sight reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore that which happens in the deep ear and which is not comprehended by sight, is in many dispositions difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows the sight, it is necessary for you to place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look at it; then if you see apparent suppuration, open it with a delicate spatula, whose form is this which follows, let its end be in which there is a small breadth, whose part is sharp: and the rest of the spatula be smooth on two sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore an abscess is born of flesh in the ear passage: then hold it with a fine hook and cut into it gently, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the matter is deep in the ear, then take a thin, soft rod and heat it with fire for a short time; then put it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel an obstruction with that which the sick person finds with heaviness of hearing, try to open it with ease; and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place licorice in the ear according to the quantity of the size of the opening which you have covered with Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take licorice and infuse it in rose water, and pulverize it with ground ginger on top of it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see an ear already suppurating, then it is necessary that you extract the pus, and allow it with another linen cloth, which is wrapped in a cerate made with rose oil, until the abscess sits hot; then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flow should occur, then immerse a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear; and use the rest of the cure which cuts off the aforementioned blood flow in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of eyelid tumors.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	The injuries to the eyelids that happen to the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you ought to hold them with forceps: or with a hook, and cut them with a spatula from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place over the spots a grinding (or pulverized) zege.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a subtle lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn up, and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of a granuloma of the eyelid.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many times there happens in the eyelids something which is similar to a Cranium in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called Granuloma: and it is an accumulation of gross humidity in the upper eyelid, and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation therefore is, that you should then consider, if there is a swelling proceeding in it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to every part, and the thing of it is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, find a fissure across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every part with ease until it flows out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, you do not prepare the incision for it, but only after you have penetrated the eyelid with a small incision, then it will harm the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large, then gather it together with a suture: and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it itself, and makes flesh.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the granulation is large and slopes towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the granulation with a hook: besides which you will need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened through an incision, it does not harm anything at all.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after cutting the cataract with salt water: and care for the place until it heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the treatment of an ulcer of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	A kind of fat is produced in the tunic of the upper eyelid; and it happens most often to children; and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrh occurs to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears flow to them, and therefore you see them lying on their faces always, and sleeping there, and their eyelids are under their brows moist, which already the swelling has covered; and the prominence of Axirnath appears to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of his operating is, that he puts the head of the sick person into your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare a groove in it, and make a circle from that groove according to the quantity which contains Axirnath from every part.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him upon it, and press with your fingers from every part, so that it may be gathered together as a circle's midpoint.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that humidity with a spatula cut incisions across, and let not the incision be greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut through the whole skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements Axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the form of a white, fleshy twig.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, remove it with the cloth which you have soaked between your fingers to the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add it into the fissure so that you do not arrive with the spatula at the eye and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you add into the fissure a little with ease until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the site, and bind it with a ligature.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And some men grind salt and put it in the hollow of the fissure so that it may liquefy what remains of its moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for the same until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If a hot abscess occurs in a place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the ways of treating a sunken eye, that is, when the eyelid softens the eye, so that it wrinkles as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow on the eyelids besides the course of natural hairs, and age: then they harm the eye, and cause types of illness, such as frequent tearing, and softening of the eyelids, and clouding, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed the eye is cured according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Either by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was said in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or it is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or through tubes, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it is turned (over), it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: introduce a needle into it where the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, in which the hairs are born: and draw the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the hairs added with an incision made from the larger lacrimal to the smaller lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread and place a small piece under the eyelid from boiled cloth or a pad; then sign over the eyelid with encaustic wax so that it is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid; because indeed it is diversified in men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	From these [kinds of incisions], there is one who needs an incision from the eyelid to be made in a quantity that is softened by the eyelid itself.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when the spatula is placed on two lines which you have marked, and begin from the larger lacrimal gland to the lesser lacrimal gland, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape the whole wound.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then, gather the two lips together with a suture, with a needle and a fine wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what is superfluous from the threads above the two eyebrows, with certain things invisible, if you wish to do this: and if not, do not bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let the suture and thread be left for three or four days, afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and care for it so that it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid should be raised during the sealing and gathering of a wound; but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This mode of curing Ataxia was taught by the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Nevertheless, there is care over the weak, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Atxamir also: and it is, as signs over the eyelid a figure, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have told.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelid with three separate or grouped hooks, according to this form which follows, then cut what is superfluous with small shears, according to this form, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold a hook, and it is not equal, then take an awl in which there is a thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure. And insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct. And gather together between your fingers the threads with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then lift your hand with equal elevation: and lift the skin over which is marked the tumor, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather the two lips of the wound together with a suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision or fissure: treat that abscess with a cautery and similar things, from sedative ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs turn.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you should use what we said about the incision; but suture of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of ataxia with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you convert the eyelid and cut the fissure which is inside, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then with skill make two canes or two slender rods, the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of them smaller than the width of a spatula: and you have already cut at the extremities of both parts from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both together with subtlety over that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly bind two tubes from both sides with strong constriction, and let it go for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For if the skin is tightly bound, it will die and become discolored and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it delays, then cut it with shears.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is elevated; and hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the shape of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and the quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of piercing hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation on this is, that you take a fine knife, and introduce into it a thread of silk, subtle, smooth.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bind together the extremities of it, and knots on each side with a fine thread: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then lay another fine thread of flax under it in a short space, and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the sick person places his head in your bosom, and let it be near the sun so that the operation may be declared; for it is a subtle operation, or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce a needle with an awl into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you extract it from above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the needle up above the ligature: and introduce it into the ligature: if there is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with a white thread from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, the eyelash is drawn out and the hair does not come out with it, draw the eyelash downward, with the thread which you have composed in it, until the eyelash comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then indeed draw the eyelash and the thread, and extract both, and close the eye: and dismiss it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh is born above it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from natural hairs, and elevate it with it; or let it alone until it grows longer after a space, and then elevate it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of al-Xatra'ti which happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this occurs to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxa'rati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, an accidental [wound] is made from the closing of a wound, or a cutting, or cauterization, and things similar to these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of operation on it is, that you find that consolidation and that you separate its lips, and put in it what is between them a ligature from linen, and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not right that you use in its cure things which dry and constrict; for if you do this, the Alexatrati will return worse than it was: indeed use in them things which soften, such as meadow hay: and embrocate with water, in which has been cooked marshmallow, flax seed: and ointment of dyaquilon, which is liquefied with some of the oils: and envelop with it licorice, and care for it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your healing is that you try with every skill that it not be consolidated, according to the form which was at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have said, is nothing but a certain rectification of Alxatrati, so that it does not return to the form of the place according to what it was altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of a pterygium which occurs in the lower eyelid and is a wrinkle or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This ulcer which is made lower down, is truly called an ulcer.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And it [wound] happens from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and those similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a doubled thread, and dye it with meat, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal duct to the right lachrymal duct until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upward with a knife, and cut it with a wide spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a ray and place it in the fissure, and turn with it the eyelid: and find two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and make an angle: until when they are gathered together, the figure of them is made like this figure, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount, which is its pointed side below, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather together the separated parts: sew them together with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Thereafter care for them with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a cut should occur from a fissure, and suturing, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make the fissure flat under the hairs of the eyelids, also as previously said.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a linen cloth, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the discourse on the treatment of a fistula, when it is above or below, is that the operation should be carried out according to how it is prepared from the form of the fistula.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For indeed it is of many variations in form: and the prudent artificer prepares the instrument according to whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form, or nearly so, and himself also weak, according to what is fitting for him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	On the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you ought to insert the end of the radius under the eyelid and raise it upward: or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a spatula, subtle, which is not with the sharpness of the incision of spatulas, but rather somewhat obtuse: so that the patient may not be disturbed during the operation, and the spatula may be removed and damage the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were excoriating the adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and the adhesion is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Pour salted water into the eye, and rinse it with water; or distill into it from a sieve made of linen cloth, dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen thread: and place over the eye wool soaked in [something] with albuginea of egg: and on the third day use sieve and with solids until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	On the incision of the fingernail and the prominence of flesh of the tear duct.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a nail is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is a nerve: and it is like a thin tough fiber.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not a nerve, similar to the frozen moisture of white: which when touched with iron or you try to grasp it with a hook, it cuts off, and a hook does not hold fast in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin unless from the greater lacrimal duct, as far as it goes gradually, until it covers the desired amount, and prevents light and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of operating on it is: that the patient places his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect a sponge with a hook of little thickness, and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle and insert into it a thread made from horse hair, ox hair, or camel hair: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle slightly, and fasten it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and remove the skin with the hair on the side of the nail that follows the pupil, and if you bind it with hair all the way to its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then make an incision in the root of the tear duct with a thin scalpel, or with small forceps: and let go of the natural tear meat, so that it does not happen from its incision continuous course of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the claw is extended with a hook, or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it should be scraped with a gentle spatula, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the knife touch the cornea, and rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, throw something crushed salt into the eye, or made from sifting of zinc, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it as is necessary until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor does a hook hold in it, then this type of nail is often cured with medicines, and heals as I have narrated in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a spatula, fine, soft, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the ulcer from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it thins and breaks, and imprints a razor in it, then distill from your hour into the eye from sief made of ziniar, or from sief rubeo, or salt rubbed: and seal the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the procedure on itself until everything is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	If a hot abscess is not in your eye, then let it alone, and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with reason until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	The prominence of the lacrimal cartilage, if it causes great harm to the eye, should be suspended with a hook, and part of it should be cut away. And do not make the incision too deep so that there is no flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then instill a drop of red lachrymal fluid, or one made from zinc ointment, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes, in some human eyes, flesh of a reddish color is born, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards: and it resembles the rose's balustrade.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in this also is, that the sick person puts his head in your bosom.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect that whole flesh with suitable hooks to it; and hold it with one forceps or a clamp.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until you finish the whole of it with the cutting instrument.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision be either with a spatula, which we have narrated in the incision of the nail; or with small forceps, with which the honeycomb is collected, according to what will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore the incision is completed, and the whole of the pus has been removed, then fill the eye with salt ground fine; or pour into it powder red, and similar things from corrosive medicines; and place upon the eye a piece of cloth with its white membrane: so that it may be secured from hot suppuration.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something from a cauterization remains and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess; then dismiss the eye, and care for it with that which will settle an abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with the operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do this with flesh added which happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	Nonetheless, it is necessary that the healing of every weak eye, through natural or accidental means, be done by operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member is bearing that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the gathering of  sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	There are red veins that are woven over the eye, and they prevent the sight from performing its function: and they weaken the eye as the days grow longer.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore it is necessary for you first of all to consider, if the eye in which is Sebel is strong, and there is no infirmity in it other than Sebel: then collect Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, as you should instruct the sick person, that he place his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be fine, doubled, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine forceps those veins with subtlety, and remove the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and dissolved: and beware that you do not injure the eye with the extremities of the spatula.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be firm in your operation indeed: that you may not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then distill into the eye a green or red sieve, so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the seal.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If you are not able to collect the whole thing in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with something that will soothe the pain of the eye: and let it be for several days until the pain subsides: and cure it from the hot boil: then repeat over it according to the same mode, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	On the reduction of a nose to its place.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians name the fistulous opening of Arissat, which they treat with a cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, according to what has preceded in his account.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you find a collection of pus at its birth, and extract all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is revealed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is revealed and you see in it corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Aspiration of the Head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make a tool out of iron and let its head be round like an azure stone, which should be marked with the marking of a file or with the delicate mark of an alembic; and place it over the place where the bone is corrupted.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and you press your hand for a short time until you know that the corruption is now scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with medicines and astringent dressings.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh is born in it, and the course of healing is severed: and it remains for forty days, and does not renew itself, and does not suppurate, and no accident happens to it: then know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no talent in him, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, as you sever from the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone has been detected, then take a terebrum according to this form, let the iron extremity be triangular: and the wood of it be a pyramid diminished until the extremity, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it over the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with a probe until it enters the nostril and feels it weak; by this he will find air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent medicinal dressings as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore the flesh is born, and the place hardens: then the matter which flowed outwards returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter upon the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the Reduction of the Protrusion of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and no harm occurs to vision, nor diminution: then it is necessary to loosen the weak; then phlebotomize him; afterwards put ventilating  ones on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place over the eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tightly bind the eye from above over the plaster with many wads.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of small ones is: that you receive soft cloths, many, and every cloth shall be doubled from them over four: make many from them; then put one on top of another, according to the quantity which the Eye needs; then bind over these with a hard cloth with strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat punctures with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the windbags, and let the eye remain closed day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If, however, the ligament softens again, then it must be tightened very much; then remove the ligament after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye already returning to its white tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and pellets, and constriction, and ventouses, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the bladder tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the eye, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and it defaces the form of man because of it, and one wishes to cut it: then the operation on it is, according to what I narrate: and it is, that you introduce an awl into the root of the eye from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle into which there is a thread double from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate; and release the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place double thread, and tie with it the part of the uva around a needle's circumference: and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in vinegar on the white of the eye: and let him go until the thread falls with a thud.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that which comforts it until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eye is bound with a circle of cloth from every side until it gives great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a fine spatula so that it reaches the depth of the eye, and moistens the white of the eye, and the eye descends, and enters immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the Treatment of Anus Problems.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This sickness called Alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to water descending, and is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the manner of operation in this is, that you make the sick person sit upon a prepared seat, either straight or bent.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head in your hands from two parts, and move it until you see the pus arrive at the lower part with your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is bound and not allowed to descend, and the opening is closed: and may the sick person see things as he was seeing: and if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If the descent of the healthy part is not prepared with what we said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula and find it with it above the skin layer for a short distance at the junction with the corneal tunic in the crown, until pus emerges.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore he goes out, then distill into the eye hot water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled hay and honey; then take care of him with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	On the treatment of water that flows into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have now spoken of the kinds of water in division, and which is suitable for piercing, the speech declaring and explaining it, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore you must make the infirm person sit between your hands, square to the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten him well: then with your right hand, if the eye in which is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand almond, if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the almond near the crown through the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye appearing lesser lacrimal; then drive the almond with force; and you will roll with it your hand until it penetrates into the white of the eye; and feel that the almond has already arrived at the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the journey from the almond to the depth be, the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see this very thing in the pupil of the eye itself, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almond until it reaches the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downward with one finger after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore water descends, then the infirm person sees it above which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore water descends, then lay it down second, except that it may flow out of the almond.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is set, and does not ascend: then draw out the almond with facility: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put a whole wad of cotton wool or wool soaked in rose oil and white of egg over the eye, and tie the sound eye to it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, place upon it pounded cinchona with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the almond does not yield to your entrance into the eye because of its hardness, because it is from men whose eyes are very hard; then you must take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose shape is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, pierce with it that very junction only, and do not push your hand into the hole; and there is no need but to make a way to the almond-shaped place under it.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And in the completion of your work, a decent sickroom should be prepared for the infirm, where he shall sleep on his back in a darkened house: and let him be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing; and place his food that which soothes his nature; and let him not move his head right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the ligature be according to its arrangement up to the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and test its appearance: and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And one should not do this at the hour of healing, or immediately after the incision: rather one should, let another do it; because water rises quickly through vehement aspect.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with what will settle the abscess, until it is settled: then loosen its vision, and place upon its surface an oral which regulates its vision under those few days, the eye being in that darkened house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should leave his house gradually, and return to his affairs.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in surgery a pupil is not excused from viewing often; then indeed may he dare to operate.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed there has come to us someone from those who are from Al-Layrarch, who said that a large drain was made in Al-Layrarch, by which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore, I did not see anyone in your land who has done that; nor did I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of things from the book, so that he who knows them not may stand upon them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of copper, and let their ends be triangular with this same fineness, and the pointed end.
Formae magda.	Magda's Forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes growths of different flesh are born in the nose, of which some resemble the feet of many scorpions: and from this is cancerous flesh, stony, dusky in color: and from this also is that which is soft flesh, not dusky in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In those things therefore which are from these meats gentle, not deceitful, and not cancerous, it is necessary that you make the infirm sit between your hands opposite to the ground, and open his nostrils, and project the hook into those meats; then draw them to the outside, and cut what you have grasped from them with a spatula subtle and sharp on one part, until you know that the whole flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remained of it whose removal is not possible: then carefully remove it with one fine instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood rules over you, or a hot abscess occurs; then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is severed and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar, water, or wine is thrown into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you shall know that it is now healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument does not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you insert a linen thread which has some thickness, and many knots on it. And place between each knot the amount of a finger, or less.  And instruct the weak person, so that he may put one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever possible to him after he has made himself a similar Azer: and draw his own scented [substance] until it reaches the cavity and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed boys similar to this Attomi do in schools; and it is a thing easy to him, who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then put two ends of a thread, one end which emerges above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then and minister a lock of flesh with knots which are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already with knots of thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread: and put it in the nose after the blood has been wiped away, using the licinium which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the matter a lead pipe into the nose for several days until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If a cure is needed that will dry it out, use this.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head fumigator, with which olive oil and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or copper: that it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for making a cautery should be full and open: which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the cure of a nose-bleed.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times a tumor is born at the tip of the nose, and it magnifies itself and increases with days until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this reason it is necessary that at the beginning of its appearance and roots, you eradicate the whole of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the location either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the incision is delayed until it has increased in size, then consider if it is stony, hard, dusky colored, and with few senses; then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times indeed I have seen one who incurred a blood-filled abscess, and from it great wickedness befell him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is mild to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its entirety, then evacuate the sick person, and make an incision into it without fear or hesitation.  Care for the place with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a rupture occurs in one of these cartilages, little is done in it, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, you must consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood; and then gather the edges of the wound with sutures; then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the continuity have already been separated, and each part has been made whole; then it is necessary that one scrape all parts with its own knife until they bleed.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather together the two lips with a suture, and tighten them, and pulverize upon it dragon's blood powder, and frankincense ground: and place above the powders a piece of diaphana plaster, and some other kind of solidifying plaster: and leave him bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it and change the medication: and let it be until the threads are cut by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suture is to join the parts of a severed continuity, either with needles as we have recounted in suturing the abdomen; or to join the parts with thread, as I have made known to you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed suffer from abscesses in their inner lips, hard and similar to grains of herbs; and some are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore it is necessary that you convert the lip, and find its nodes above all, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after incision with pounded ziziphus, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it shall be covered with vinegar, and the place where there is coagulation shall be treated with it until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On cutting flesh born above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often there is born on the gum flesh that the ancients call an abulus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus flow, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place over the rubbed place, or other sticking powders, drying ones.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after healing, for it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the extraction of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they gather on the surfaces of teeth from the inner and outer part, and between the gums cortices rough, unsightly, and sometimes become yellowed, and greenish, until corruption comes from it to the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you ought to make the sick person sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and scrape the callous and tooth, where it appears to you as if there were bark and something like sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do for the blackness, and greenness, and yellowness, and others until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore what is in them is removed from the beginning of the reason, it is good: and if not, then repeat over them the reason on another day, second, and third, until the last study arrives in that which you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth needs razors of different shapes and forms, according to how it is prepared for your operation: therefore, the razor with which a tooth is shaved from the lower part is different from the razor with which a tooth is shaved between teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors be prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that one treat a tooth with pain with all skill and delay in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing that can replace it when it is removed; because it is a sublime substance: so that when there is no excuse for its removal, then when the sick person is compelled to remove it, he must make firm and be certain with you about the aching tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth shaft and extracts it: then the pain does not depart until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore it is certified to you that a tooth aches itself, then it is necessary that you scarify in the circumference of the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gums are loosened from every part; then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps in that place, and the head of the patient between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move; then draw the tooth according to a straight line, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take some one of those instruments and introduce it under it from every part with ease, and attempt its motion, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and bind it with the extremity of a fine thread, so that it does not break at the hour of your tightening upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act with exquisite care when making a cut around the gum on every part very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength so that you will not break it, and let its part remain, and return upon the weak from that evil which is greater pain of his first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and audacity in the removal of it, besides administering what we have recounted.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times indeed they make great illnesses happen to men, of which the more difficult are that they be broken, and that all or some of their roots remain; or that they extract it with some bones of the jawbone: as we have testified many times this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be filled after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If it should happen that there is a flow of blood from these places (for this often happens), then fill that place with something from the bandage, and if not, cauterize it if you do not have a bandage.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps which move a tooth primarily, should be long at the extremities, short at the handle, thick so that they do not double when pressed upon a tooth; like those of thick handles, so that when you tighten them, they do not bend themselves or double; short at the extremities, and made of iron well-wrought, or of steel skillfully crafted, with straight ends. And at their ends let there be teeth which some enter into others, and bind by a decent, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes limbs become like the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, and are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the site of a broken tooth's extraction, then it is necessary to place butter on the spot for one or two days until the place softens; then introduce a probe or forceps, the ends of which resemble the beak of a stork bird.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of this is a forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let the extremities be made like a file inwards: or like an awl.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not obey you in its exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you dig above the root, and uncover the whole flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a Small Lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let the short end of the limb be somewhat thick and not soaked so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore it emerges through that, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	Shape of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	Shape of a slender pointed extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also used with this instrument having two branches, whose shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the extraction of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also let there be an instrument with this one which resembles a large hook, of this form, triangular in shape at the end, twisted, and having some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the other instruments are not numbered, and a wise artificer, subtle in his art finds for himself by himself the instrument, according to what the operation and the pains themselves signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since these are from regions where ancient people did not mention instruments because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, a bone is broken from the jawbone, or from other bones of the mouth, or if it rots: then examine it carefully in its place with that which is suitable to it from instruments and forceps which I have said in the extraction of roots, and help with a clamp, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of a certain thickness gradually, so that it may tighten or hold with the bone, and not escape and bleed until the bone emerges; and restore the place with appropriate medicines to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is a small amount of rot in the bone, then scrape it away from its rot, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the Locking of Teeth Which Are Projecting Over Others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude beyond their natural course, a foul form arises from it, and especially when this happens to women and girls, namely the vulva.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you ought to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	If a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or it is possible to serrate it, nor file it; then eradicate it: and if it is attached with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and it is made of iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be made in many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that it may not move another from the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If it is prominent, exposed from its rasping, then rasp it with a rasp from within, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the entire thing be from wood, and the handle of it have small holes, like a file used to make needles; with which the tooth is gradually limed over many days with ease, so that it does not move the tooth and causes it to fall: then soften it, at the end file it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If it is a tooth that has fractured and injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file it until the roughness of its fracture is removed, and it is made level; and flattened, so that it does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On extracting teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are shaken and bruised by a blow or accident: and the infirm cannot hold what he eats upon it so that it does not fall: and you have treated them with medicinal astringents, and the treatment did not benefit: then the ingenuity is in them to be tied together with gold thread: because silver becomes green and rots after days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be medium in fineness and thickness according to the quantity which it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the ligation is that you take a thread and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth: then weave with both ends of the thread between the moving teeth, whether one there is or more, until you reach with the cloth up to the healthy tooth of the other part.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the part from which you began: and grasp your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is no longer moved: and let your constriction, as you tighten the thread, at the roots of the teeth, be such that it does not leak out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the superfluous ends of the thread with forceps: and bring together both sides, and turn them with a twist: and conceal them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue: then let it be left thus tight until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is loosened, or cut, bind them together with another thread, and it will stand firm with it throughout the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of Teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth, and two mobile teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth, or two, return after injury to their places and remain as we have narrated, and this is done only by an artisan, prudent and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone from the jaw is fitted, and it is shaped like a tooth and placed in the space, from which the tooth is protected and tightened, as we have said: and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in this is, that you open the mouth of the sick person in the head of him in your lap, and elevate his tongue: then cut that nervous ligament across its width, until the tongue is loosened from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound, then throw a hook into it, and pull it sideways until you cut the ligament and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware lest there be a fissure in the deep flesh, and you cut the artery there, and blood flow occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it should be rinsed in the wound with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a poultice of flax, which the sick man will hold throughout the night so that it does not solidify again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If blood flow should occur, then place on the place a bit of crushed wool.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a sluggish cautery, which is suitable for it; then take care of it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of a ranula which is found under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a boil occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it becomes so large that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is, that you open the wound of the sick in front of the sun: and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dusky color, or black, hard, to which the sick person does not find feeling; then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined towards the bladder, and in which there is moisture, then throw into it the hook, and cut into it with a spatula finely, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you in the hour of your operation, then place on it pounded zegi until the blood is stopped; then return to your operation until you have extracted it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be covered with vinegar and salt: and care for it with the rest of the appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the cure of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat and godad, that is, glands, which resemble algodad, which occur deforis: and they are called two almonds: which when you treat with that which we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, dusky in color, with few sensations: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a reddish color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, but let it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will rupture of itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and its root is subtle: then it ought to be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on him is that before you perform your operation, consider if his hot pus has subsided and has quieted completely, or diminished by some reduction: then have the sick person sit down in front of the sun, and his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant receive between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose form is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made from silver or copper, as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you have pressed upon it with him, and the abscess is shown to you, and it falls upon it by your sight: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out to the exterior as much as you can, except that you draw along with it something from the coats.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is similar to scissors; however, its extremities are curved so that the opening of each is directly opposite the sharp point of the other; therefore, care should be taken that it is made from iron or imbued with lead.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, which has this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other following this same kind of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision the sick man should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If blood flow should occur to him, let him gargle with water in which the husks of grains have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things from astringents, until the blood flow is stopped; then take care of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes abscesses are born in the throat, other than the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut it as I said, in the incision of two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself had treated a woman from an abscess which had formed between her throat and was drawing towards the chest, with few sensations, as it almost completely closed the throat; and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water; and she had already advanced to death, if she had remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had grown so much that it had sent out two branches until they emerged above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened and fixed one of them in place.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large portion was extracted from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it where it is grasped from the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did that which had proceeded from the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess: then I cut away part of it, and there flowed out from it only a little blood: therefore the woman's throat was cleansed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period; and an abscess would succeed the place where I cut, until it was extended too much and along with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised and cauterized an abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore I stood after the addition: then I walked away from the part, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	On the incision of a vulval abscess.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When catarrh descends to the womb and suppurates and is long, then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part, thick, round, then it is called a womb.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the cure does not help: and you see that the hot abscess has calmed from it, and is subtle: then it is necessary that you cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And which is a round aggregate from it, and has no length to it, and is bloody, or brownish in color, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary to cut into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	Therein lies fear over the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I have said, and its width, and length, let you make the infirm one sit facing the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the previous account was made; then fix the hook in the uvula, and draw it downward: and cut it with one of the two instruments which I have said in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you not cut from it except what is added above the natural boundary without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	If you cut deeper from that, you injure voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated in the incision of two tonsils: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If the patient fears incisions, then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterization without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the way of cauterizing in it is not unless with sharp water; and it is, as you put the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press down on his tongue with the instrument that we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water that I have told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and put it not thick, nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it, whose shape is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity to which the medicine is applied be concave, like the concavity of a spoon's handle.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with medicine upon the wound itself: and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva from his mouth may flow from the inner medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat, and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you will apply the first of these ointments to the ulcer for a half hour's time, until you see it diminished and calmed by the medicinal medication.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to receive the lint, and wrap it over the end of the radius, and fill the lint with medicine, and introduce the radius with the lint into the tube from above, until the lint adheres to the vessel.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the vein.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it be removed; for it will dry up and fall off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you wish to repeat the medicine, repeat it; and after cauterization wipe around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and purify with that which is around it from the medicine; and cover it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it should be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this kind of treatment is healthier with incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes a wound is treated even when it is more delicate than cauterization and incision: for it is cured by fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a cloth and hyssop and oregano and rue and sage and chamomile and wormwood and similar herbs: and gather all these, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and let them boil: and let the pot be lined with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, on which an instrument is placed concave according to this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze, and let the extremity, in which is the grain, be inserted into the bone of the infirm, until vapor ascends to the bladder above the tube, until the bladder becomes greatly darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeatedly over it many times until it stops.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this cure at the beginning of the coming of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Usually he adds this to a boil, and you should not do it unless the decline of the boil is hot.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube and place cork at its end so that the bone of the infirm does not burn; because cork prevents steam from burning the bone; and this is from good care with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	On the extraction of thorns, and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many times a fish bone or other thing adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore it is necessary that you remove what appears from them which falls upon the sight, after you have pressed the tongue with an instrument at the sun, and it has been made clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary for you to make a vomiting before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps, indeed, the thing attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the sick person swallow a piece of barley, or lettuce root, or a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, gentle, and bind it with thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it comes to the place where the spines, or bones are, and is extracted, then it exits.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not exit with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than the radius a little, and at its end let there be a curvature, so that it may enter its throat with ease; and let it itself have its head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest he have a cough, and drive it in with his mouth or spine, or insert it himself with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	It is indeed better if the infirm person inserts it; because of his knowledge of the place of the annexed thing: and he pushes down below, or pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of it according to the quantity that is prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the removal of leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is applied with what I said in the division on healing with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed their tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with these things: then take a concave tube and insert it into the throat of the sick person up to near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the tube iron heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full mouthful of cold water and open his mouth in it; and let him fill his mouth with it, and not swallow any of it; and move the water every hour with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech, when it feels water, immediately falls down.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not come out as we have narrated, then smoke the sick person with lice, or with asa and the instrument I have narrated in the fumigation of the vulva.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for it will fall of itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which are live plums with fire: and let the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which there is a hole: and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the fumigation, and let the sick person put their mouth at the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the bloodletting area.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the weak one bear thirst, and eat salted foods, and others, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he depart with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which bloodsucker is extracted from the throat when it falls upon itself by sight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which goes into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like the beak of a stork, which has the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the incision of abscesses and their cutting, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of boils, and many ways, according to how they are remembered, namely one, and one in this book: and they are different in their piercing, and cutting them in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of these is a kind of abscess within itself, and that which it contains from humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because a boil occurring in the head is different from a boil occurring in the anus: and a boil occurring in a fleshy place is different from a boil occurring in the joints: and to each of these their own judgment by operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from boils there are some which ought not to be pierced unless after the ripening of the healing in them, and its completion: and from these there are some which ought to be pierced while they are raw, and do not ripen according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess when it happens near a joint and it is prolonged until it rots what is around it, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint will be corrupted: therefore it is the proximate cause of contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess at a main limb: for if you delay its piercing until it ripens, it will harm either him or through that main limb.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	If it is near the anus, pierce it when immature: and it should not be pierced if it is a raw abscess, not yet fully digested, except if it is near the anus so that it does not rot deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or form at its end that which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You ought to know the hour of perforation of a boil that has matured according to its completion: and it is in the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulse, and sharpness of the head of the boil: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess and the more prominent eminence: and let the perforation be sharp in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the lacerations, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and ultimately in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those which are reflected, go with a piercing according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When a boil is in fleshy places: then it is better to let the opening of it discharge, until its digestion has been confirmed, as we have said according to the completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that point, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps the lips of it will endure, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain abscesses are pierced according to the width of the body, as necessity demands; or according to what limb needs it.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a wide perforation; or many incisions according to the likeness of the magnitude of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be scooped out; and it should be cut when it has become like a cloth, and has come to an end, that is, when it has died: such as happens in many cases, so that it may burst, and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And among these are those which are cut with a three-angled incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of these is one which occurs like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of these there are those in which a round incision and a lunar incision are administered, and similar incisions to these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	As for those who lack a head, as in superficial, soft boils, it is necessary to pierce them with a superficial or only flat perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the abscess is large and has already gathered much pus, that you pierce it, so that you do not hurry and extract all the pus in that hour; rather, extract part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then let it be treated with poultices and an abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to gradation, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in virtue, or a pregnant woman, or a small boy, or an old decrepit man: for the animal spirit is much resolved from the animal with the expulsion of phlegm: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, take great care with this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after you have perforated it, through which you pierce the abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound; and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore is a wound of small abscess, or is a flat section, then administer lint from linen, or old cotment.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if it is a large abscess, and there are many fissures of the opening, then you must introduce into every fissure a liniment until they reach each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in an abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or hollowed it out on its edge: then it is necessary that you fill it with old dung, or as when a cloth is used to cover it, or wool is applied without moisture; and bind it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it away, and take care of it with what is necessary ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If it happens that there is bleeding during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar after a cloth has been soaked in them: and place it over the place of bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, bleeding persisted, then it is necessary that you administer a regimen and treatment and powders, which I have recounted in many places in this book of ours, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is in wintertime, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves, then it is necessary that you pour poultices with wine and hot oil, and place them over the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer and the places are fleshy: then you ought to put little sponges soaked in water, and oil, or him with wine and oil, and the whole thing cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you should loosen the abscess and cleanse it, and administer to its cure what is fitting for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of healing boils universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the method of distinction, I have already said about every kind of abscess, how the way to its cure is taken individually chapter by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of boils that occur in the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLIX.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small boils occur in the scalp skin and are of the kind of nodules, which contain sacks, like small bags of chicken's blood.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of these there are fatty ones; and there are those which contain moisture like slime; and those which contain moisture like gruel and porridge; and the like; and there are also those which are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the sectioning of all and their extraction there is no fear, as long as it does not oppose the artery during the sectioning of them.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation on their section is that you should experience it with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	If it is that which contains moisture, then dry it with a cut along its length by a superficial cut: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a cut from line b to line g. When therefore the humidity is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that humidity, and do not allow anything to be taken out of it completely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Often indeed it returns, if anything remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse a wad in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode that which remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the same tumor with an Egyptian second and third time, and if you do not digest it with this, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it contains a fatty node, then cut it according to this form, with the incision having the shape of a cross: and throw hooks between the two lips of the incision, and scrape it from every part: and try your strength in extracting the tunic that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery acts against you, then do that which I shall tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, from incision, and cure the same, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision over a stone abscess is easier because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are in the head in some men, with which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is, because I cut into an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid, hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if it were struck with something by throwing it, it would wound it.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other boils and accidents on the head, besides these namely those which happen on the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the section of all of them should be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or place the perforation of them always from the lower part of them, that the course of healing may be relieved downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for him as is convenient in his cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	On the cutting of strangulated veins in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those which happen from them in the neck, there are one and many: and they are generated from each other: and every strophula from these is inside its own tunic, as it is in nodes and boils of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of these Strophulaes.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from these there are stones; and from these there are those which contain moistures; and from these there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one therefore which you see of good disposition in touch, whose manifest color is near to the skin, and it moves to every part, and is not attached with nerves of the neck, nor with the guidegi, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: it is necessary to cut it by a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along the line, b. to the line, g., and to scrape it from every part: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks if you need it, as we said in abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a matter of great care that one not wound a vein, or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula be not too sharp: so that it does not add your hand with the incision, or trouble the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If, however, you cut a vein, or artery, or something prevents you from operating, then place in the wound ground zegi, or some powders that stop blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess has subsided, and the wound has softened: or it begins and wants to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is cut off, tunic. So go back to your operation until you have finished it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then probe with your index finger if anything of the other small strophuli remains; therefore cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If a large vein is in the root of the strophula: then it is necessary that you do not cut that strophula from its root: rather it is necessary that you tie it with a doubled strong thread, and let it go until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound of the belly, which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for it itself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the strophulus is cut entirely, then it is necessary to bring together the two lips of the wound: and its own, immediately after you see that there remains not at all superfluous matter.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is excess remaining because of the size of the Stropha, then it is necessary to extend it to cut its root and remove it, and administer the suture which we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And that which contains moisture from the strophulus, pierce it with a superficial perforation, so that the place of its maturity may appear to you; and place the perforation below that which follows in the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after perforation administer a plaster with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains from corruption until when you see the wound already clean: then care for it with an ointment of flesh generation, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this incision is in the epiglottis, and I did not see anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those having a synanchia, it is necessary that the section of the Epiglottis be made; when this is not helpful, because all veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no pain in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the Epiglottis, to avoid destruction that occurs from pre-inflammation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, it should be done under three or four circles of the epiglottis with a small incision across its width, in that which is between two circles, so that the section be in the soft tissue and not in the cartilage; and this place is convenient for cutting because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If a surgeon is fearful, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he must lay open the skin until he reaches the vessel; if he sees anything coming from them, let him remove it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he cuts the incision as we have narrated; and it signifies on the cutting of the canal from the pus that comes out of it, with what is broken apart, and the severance of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave an open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore it is removed at the hour when fear of inflammation, bring together the two lips of the wound of skin, and suture itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that make flesh grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of what we have narrated, is not an exposition, unless when they see that some of these abscesses have already opened the throat of the sick person; and the sick person has been raised above death, and wants to be cut open so that he breathes, and is saved from death; therefore they go to cut the Epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with some respiration, and be saved from death; and for this reason they ordered to leave the wound open until the evil of the illness has been consumed, and it is three days in nature, then they ordered to sew up the wound, and take care of it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw with my own eyes was that one maidservant took a knife and sent it into her throat, and it struck the part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to care for him, and I found him mooing, as is the mooing of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I discovered therefore from the wound, and I found blood which had gone out of the wound small.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I am confused that she did not cut off the vein or artery, and wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore attended to his wound and cared for it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the handmaid except a hoarseness of voice; and after days she returned to better disposition of her affairs.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say: that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the incision of an inguinal hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess called Hernia gutturis is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural; or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly it is not natural talent.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	An accident is according to two modes: one of which is similar to fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And another way is similar to an abscess that arises from the tying of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in itself there is fear, and it ought not to be presumed against it with a sword unless in that which is small; and you try it, and investigate it with an introduction.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find a similar lump to the one described, and it is not suspended with any veins: then cut it, just as knots are cut; and extract it along with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then examine the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place as is necessary until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	On cutting above the species of Nodes.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already said all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a Node, and an Fistula: when there is doubt-making.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore I say, that when the heat, fever, and violent pains have subsided until the boiling of superfluity is calmed and putrefaction is complete: then indeed the fever and heat will cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When a node is not hot, nor feverish, nor painful, and it contains them with its own bag called sifachin, which is according to the color of the body: and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a lentil, and larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Node, it is necessary that you examine it and inquire about it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which follows after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the way to inquire about abscesses and all nodes is, that you take this instrument and insert it into the more humid place which you find in the abscess: and you revolve your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already pierced the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then draw out what was inserted, and consider that which comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore a running wetness emerges, whatever color it may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the rest of abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if the moisture does not exit in the path of introduction, then know that it is fat: therefore make a dry incision over it having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from every part with ease; and guard the cyst if you can over it, so that you may extract it sound with the node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If however the bladder bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to remove it whole, since this often happens, then remove it in pieces until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything is left from it, a little or much, a Knot will return according to the greatest amount.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you and there remains a little of it, then fill the wound at your completion with some corrosive powders, and tighten the wound, and place above it that which sits hot abscess, and care for it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore a knot is large, then suture its two lips, and care for it with that which is conjoined.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If however the pulsating vein or non-pulsating vein is against you: then hasten, and fill the place with triturated zege and let it be loose for two or three days until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood subsides: then return to cutting what remains from the Node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning instruments for cutting and piercing the mouth.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are forms of instruments introduced, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From these there is a great one, and from these there is a medium one, and from these there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made from iron lancets of the squares' extremities centered, that they may hasten the entrance into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of Experiences, and no, that is to say, piercing: and one of them is named beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Of these there is a great, and a middle, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	It is necessary that these abscesses, and discharges, and fistula, and swellings be investigated from what exists between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles which they insert under the skin, out of yellow metal, or copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better ones are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	Experience is also made with black lead, which is useful to try out fistula tubes, whose concavity reflects back so that they are reflected gently with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the quantity of width of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of hooks, and there are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because they are simple ones, that is, those with one care: and they are of three kinds as you see, Great, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And of these there are blind pouches: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And of these there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and of these there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and there are three kinds: because among them is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The extremities that are cut are sharp, the other extremities are not sharp; and they are not placed in this way unless that help is given to them with a scraping of nodules out of fear of incision of the vein, or nerve; and that the weak one may be healed through them, and find a little peace from burning as he finds in the scraping of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magda, and there are three kinds of them.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal, and are similar to a Still used for making alcohol: and at the wide end there is a small point hidden called Spatula; and through this it flows inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of pus pockets that are hidden between the fingers at the site of a wound abscess: and the sick do not feel these, and they come in three types, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Wounds of the winds with which the flow of blood is cut off; and they are three kinds, great, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of copper or citrine, round, a little lengthways, as you see: and let them be fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of  wind instruments be with you both great and small: so that you may cut off blood with them quickly when it is necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you do not use them for cutting blood in every place of the body, but only in fleshy places: such as the armpits of the legs, and hips, and armpits of the arms, and nipples, and belly, and groin, and the like, from fleshy, moist wounds.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made from them small instruments similar to the bark of a fist, according to their form: with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or near the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made from them round, according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the treatment of the nipples of men which resemble the nipples of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men swell at the time of sleep (that is, when they begin to dream) until they resemble the breasts of women, and they remain festering with pus.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever avoids this, it is necessary that he cut above the nipples with a lunar section, according to this form from the line, b, to the line, g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill the wound with a medicine of incorporated [ingredients].
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the nipple is inclined downwards and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it must be cut in two sections on its upper sides, similar in shape to the moon, each containing the other at the edges of both, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards scrape the skin which is between the two lips and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however you are not able to make the incision as is required of you because of the restlessness of the sick person, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a thick ointment submerged with corrosive substance, and leave it so, until it corrodes that which remains from fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the incision of a boil that happens under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur under the nipple are of kinds of hard  Strophula, which contain cysts, and from these are those which contain humors.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those which contain moisture should be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g. And when everything that is in the abscess from pus has been evacuated, then fill it with old stool, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the clot is removed, and it is treated with ointment suitable for it until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If an abscess be of the kind of Strophula knots, then cut above it, as we said in the section about cutting into Strophulae equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, a wound is extended so that it emits pus, then administer to it cautery, according to what we have said before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it is healed, often a boil occurs from there, and similarly with veins, that a boil and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and inflammation are due to an artery and a vein are: because when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a crackling sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is because of the Vein, is round on the manifest body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And a section above this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it is necessary that his care be performed with iron, and what from them is also in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it be performed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, about that which is from them by inflation of the artery's opening, make a cut in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with hooks, afterward the Artery: and free it from its coverings until it is revealed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce the point under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place that is between two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood that is in it comes out and the abscess breaks up.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a cure that generates pus until the ligaments fall away; afterwards care for it with ointments suitable to it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you ought to hold with your hand as much as you can from the abscess with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce a needle under the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the band with the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you about the ligament of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another needle with a different thread under the entire abscess at the incision; press and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the abscess in the middle of itself until it brings forth what is in it; then cut away the excess skin, and release what is tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place upon it the little bit that you submerged in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment which is done with liniments and ointment until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	On an abscess that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As an abscess occurs in an artery and vein, so also does it occur in a nerve; which occurs in them by percussion, or by excessive labor, and the like: and it is most frequent in those places of the helpers, or heel, and in every place where joints are moved: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, it feels in it weak like a kind of stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an abscess collected deep in the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go to the front parts, or forward, nor backward to the back parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is among those things in the joints, it ought not to be entered with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which is from them in the head, or on the forehead, cut the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it; then remove it, and close the wound with suture; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter LXI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	There happen to some men many times in their bellies, and in the rest of their bodies, growths which are called Fungalia, by similarity of them with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of which is fine, and their head is thick, and their lips are reversed.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is small of these: and it is much magnified of these.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have seen a man, and in his belly were two swellings which were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, small roots, and their lips were turned inward and they ended, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, cut them and I found in one a weight of almost X and VIII ounces and in the other almost VI ounces. And the operation in their incision is, that you consider then, if the infirm is moist, and the color thelil is white, moist, subtle root: then cut it with a wide spatula, and let cauteries be present in your fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled during its cutting; therefore if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a weak and fearful patient from the cutting with iron, then take a lead thread made properly, and bind it with it athleul: whose way is which we have said, and release him in two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add lead to the constriction.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease pulling on the lead until it is imprinted into the tile, until it breaks off and falls by itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the root is of great size, then in its incision there is some fear and anxiety, especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless it is possible that you cut its half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not presume to cut into the thing that is dusky in color, with few senses, and foul appearance: for this is a cancerous abscess; and I will come back with a remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the treatment of the eminence of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter LI.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A protrusion of the umbilicus arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures which are above the belly and it exits from there either the large intestine or the small intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Either from the blood that flows from a Vein, or from an Artery, according to what has been said before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or contracted by a wind therein.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If it is due to a fissure of the skin and the discharge of pus: then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is because of the protrusion of the intestines, then its location is, with that which we have narrated, of greater variety.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it becomes much larger at the entrance of the bath, and labor is felt.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If it is because of moisture, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is a constriction added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If it is because of blood, then with these signs the pus appears black from the ulcer.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If it is due to flesh being born: then it is a serious, large, hard abscess, and it forms according to the amount of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If it is because of windiness, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on this is that you should consider then if the prominence of the navel is because of blood from the Artery, or Vein, or windiness; then it is necessary that you prevent its cure.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses because of the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominence of the navel is due to intestine or a tumor: then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person so that he holds his breath and stands standing extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with a cautery around the whole navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie down between your hands upon his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a spatula wide around the navel above the place which you have marked with encrustation.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him around with a strong thread, or with a silk cord of firm ligament: and let the knot of the ligament be untied.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the center of the abscess extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already caught by the ligament: then extract it with an instrument, and introduce into it your index finger, and drive the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut away its superfluity.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, the artery or vein is opposite you, then wind around it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	Take two needles and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two needles around the circumference which you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then bind the abscess in four places above the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle, and leave the place, until the extended flesh rots: and falls by itself: or cut it yourself when it becomes subtle and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary from ointment until he heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the prominence of the umbilicus is from flesh or a hernia, or from moisture, then it is necessary to concave the abscess as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And you shall draw out blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with that which solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	On the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have spoken in the division of the kinds of Cancer, and how is the way to its cure with medicines: and beware of it with its cure with iron, that it may not ulcerate: and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the womb, and caution from its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it: such as cancer that is in the nipple, or in the hip, and similar parts, from members located to remove the whole thing: especially when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it becomes old and large, it is not proper that you should approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal anyone from it; nor did I see anyone before me who has ever cured it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation in this case, when it is situated as we have said, is, as before, to open the patient from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find the lancet filled with blood that is clearly visible.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick person for the preparation, in which he will be operated on.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw into the ulcer hooks that fit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterward, hollow out the entire thing with skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the gross blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If a flow of thick blood from an incision in an artery or vein causes you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we speak in the division of the kinds of dropsy, and how the gathering of water is made: and the signs of every kind, and its cure with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is only a species of abscess alone; and it is not approached with iron in the case of otitis, nor in the case of hydrops entirely; for this is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this type of Watery Swelling of the Ear with medicines, and your treatment has not helped, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another infirmity besides dropsy, such as coughing, or diarrhea of the belly, and things similar to these: then beware that you do not treat him with iron; because there is fear of this.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see a patient with abundant strength and the only ailment is hydrops, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the mode of operation on him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and a minister behind him presses his abdomen with his hand, driving water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a pointed spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let there be two acute parts, long and with a sharp end like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	Nevertheless, there should be something of brevity little by little so that you do not pass through it with him at the operation up to the intestines and wound him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	If a Hydrops is generated from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a section from the navel three finger widths down directly above the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If now the generation of Hydropsis is because of the sickness of the liver, then your section should be on the left from the navel three fingers' width.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is because of the spleen, then let a section be made on the right side: and it ought not also to be a section on the side on which the sick person will lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin entirely with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce your hand into that incision, and elevate it with a spatula between the skin, and scrape, as if you were excoriating it; and let the quantity which is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the siphon until it reaches the place of emptiness: and there is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or copper, or brass, soft and polished: which has a small hole in its lower part, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end is cut, according to the way a reed is cut, as you see: at the upper end of it is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore it evacuates from the water in one hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person will die within an hour through the dissolution of his animal spirit; or he may be seized with fainting which is close to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Truly evacuate from it according to the quantity of its power, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person signify to you from the power of his pulse, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is held immediately because of the skin which retains the opening that is above the sica: about which I have told you, so that you pierce it according to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then on the second day, if you see the patient able to tolerate it, repeat the instrument and also withdraw a small amount of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and keep yourself from error, until there remains little water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	If, however, you have brought forth from the water a great deal of infirmity, then take care of him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and let him expect thirst. And take care of him with drying medicines until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have narrated before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care of infants who are born with their urinary passages unperforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LVIII.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone emerges from the womb of his mother and his head is not open, or the opening is narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born with a spatula subtle and fine, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a slender lead pin in the hole, and tie it: and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wishes to pass urine, he should remove it, and micturate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows over the place, will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	He who has a narrow opening is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	Those who have an opening in a place not their own are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is because those who are born have an opening at the end of the member: therefore he cannot urinate forward until he elevates the member with his hand upward.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Therefore, it has no generation because semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line; and it is a foul and terrible suffering.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation on this is that the sick person be laid upon his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of the rod with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the rod from the place of the priapus, with a sharp point, or a sharp spatula: as is the incision of a reed, or as you would cut something with a radish, so that its middle comes similar to the head of the rod: and so that a hole falls in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And take care of yourself during your operation from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	It happens often indeed.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore oppose him with that which cuts blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Of Albucasis concerning things that happen in the prepuce and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These things often happen to Albucasis on the stick, and it is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it another is malignant, and another not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, a non-malignant tumor should not be suspended with a fine hook and cut off until it is completely removed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it a poultice submerged in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for him afterwards with diacynon ointment until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If Albucasis is malignant, of foul color, then you must administer cautery to it after its incision and its root.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however the albather is in the foreskin of a captive who has not been circumcised, and part of the albather is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary that you remove the albather which is inside first, until when it solidifies, then care for the one outside: because when you care for it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal but is pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And sometimes blackening and corruption also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you must hollow out everything that has been blackened and which wants to be corrupted, or that is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then a line on top of it after that with honey which has already been mixed with flour and the cortex of pomegranate seeds, and the herb called cribellum.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, bleeding occurs, then administer cautery with lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is a help for two dispositions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and for a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the vine is cut and destroyed in an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the sick person may urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary to excise it with a blunt Spatula until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these delicate things, then it is necessary to scrape something from the head of the penis and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is, because when the prepuce is thin, it may be pierced because of its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated with a wine compress until it solidifies.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the purification of infants, and the treatment of what happens to them by mistake.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds: however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is in boys properly, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation, and a smoother way leading to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore I say, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is because I have found that most surgeons and bloodletters use purification by cutting around with a knife and forceps; and they use a pointed stick, and tie it up with thread, and make incisions with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I indeed have already tested all of these methods, and I have not found a better purification with forceps and ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For when, in purification, with a knife, skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the foreskin has two layers of skin: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower tunic remains: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and the future pain will be caused.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when purification is made with the alfacat, that is, a finger (used) by surgeons, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In purification, however, when the nail possibly comes out with iron, and spoils your operation: and indeed the skin of a child is short in nature, and many times they are born like this, that they do not need purification: and already I have seen it.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Purification with forceps and a thread ligature proved to be a good experience for me because the forceps are proportional to the incision; indeed, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you have laid your hand upon it, the two points are proportioned, and they cut according to the operation one at a time: and compression is made of a similar figure, containing the skin of the twig from every part, with which there falls no error whatsoever.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the way of operating is this, that you make him, especially a boy, if he is one who understands somewhat, to think that you are doing nothing except tying a thread on his staff; and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible to you because of what he receives with his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands prepared posture, and let him not be sitting: and conceal the forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy sees them not at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then put your hand into its shaft and puff on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the shaft comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it of the dirt that has gathered upon it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind below with a little ligature secondarily.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament well, and make an incision between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin upward quickly, and remove the head of the staff.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to flow gradually (for it is better) and place powder on top: and above the powder, a cloth in which a sponge was soaked in rose water, shaken with rose oil. Recent good; and let him be laid upon it until the next day; and take care of the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let there be two blunt ends, and let them be applied: so that no branch of the key may go out of them: and let the length of two points be equal to the length of two manubria.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	A mistake that can occur during cleansing is this: for perhaps it completely escapes the inner skin, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your finger before the suppuration of the place: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then remove it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If it should happen that three days have passed and the thing under the rod remains swollen, an abscess: then dismiss it until the abscess sits warm, and scrape away at it with ease, and cut into it according to what is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	It will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore care for it with that which solidifies a wound from the powders, which we have narrated in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut from the skin above measure, and goes out to higher parts, it does not harm it even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by a blockage made from stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar things of those which we said in the modes of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if urine does not pass and you see its retention is because of a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder; then it is necessary that he be weak over his knees bent.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then he shall place his feet upon his back, and extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and tighten his labored breathing as much as possible to him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is compelled towards the posterior for the expulsion of the stone, urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not dissolved with what we have said, and the matter is strong over the weak: then you must administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose shape is this: Let it be made of silver, and be subtle, gentle, concave like the quill of a bird’s feather in subtlety of radius, long in similarity to one and a half palm: let it have a subtle cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way out of Urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or linen to its end, a good ligature: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe: and cut with scissors if anything superfluous from the wool, but insert into the cannula with force, like alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then wet the syringe with oil or butter, and albumen of egg; and make the sick person sit on a seat, and introduce the bougie into the bladder, and its rod with moist oils, and olive oil, and lukewarm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the rod with ease until it reaches the root of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above the navel from the upper part.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then drive the syringe into it, until it reaches the bladder, and feel that it has come weak to the empty place: and this is not done in this order, unless because the passage, in which it goes, is in which there is twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For urine will follow wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then remove it, and make the urine flow through the urethra: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of clysterizing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood freezes in it, or pus is constricted in it, and water and medicines are distilled into it: then a tool called Clepshydra is made, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed shut, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place where that which propels it is, should be according to the quantity which it requires without addition, until when it is drawn with it, it draws from humidities: and when it is pushed, with it it expels to a distance: according to what the syphon does, which projects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to throw the humidity into the vein, introduce the end of the syringe into the humidity, and draw with it that which drives it upwards, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the syringe.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the extremity of it into the rod, according to what we have narrated in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the moisture with that which drives it for that moisture comes to the vein immediately, so that the weak one feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a thin enema for irrigating the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass: whose head is higher like a small sickle, and below it a groove where the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a sheep's bladder and put moisture in it, with which you wish to irrigate the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature and double thread: and heat that humidity for a little while over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the clyster into the rod, afterwards grasp your hand over the vessel with moisture of a decent constriction, until the sick person feels that this moisture has already arrived at the vessel.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If a bladder is not present for you, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those openings, as they turn.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather a circle as if it were being gathered with wool; after you have placed within it what you wish of moist substances, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie him in the instrument: and do with him as you did with the bladder from the expression with your hand, until moisture comes to the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the Extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the division of kinds of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have said the difference between stone generated in the kidneys, and bladder, and the signs of all of it: and I have said the stone in which the operation falls with hand and section: and it is stone generated in the bladder properly: and he who is fixed on a rod: and I am narrating this with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is that urine comes out of the bladder similar to water in its fineness: and it appears in it white sand, and the sick man rubs his rod, and labors with it, and many times it hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is erected and goes out with it anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is an easy healing of boys up until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths, however, it is medium, in that which is between these: and of its whose Stone is greater, healing is easier: and if small, it is reversed the care of it.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When therefore we come to the cure, it is necessary first of all that we cleanse the sick man with an enema, which will extract all the dung which is in his intestines; for this sometimes prevents the finding of the Stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then take the patient with his feet and jostle him, and move him downwards: so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or leaps from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands, and his hands be under his hips, that the whole bladder may slope downward.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then inquire about him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then hasten immediately with a section upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you ought to wipe the index finger with the oil of the left hand, if the boy is weak; or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth; and introduce it into his anus, and inquire for the Stone until it stands under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards towards the place whose section you desire; and order your assistant to press the scrotum with his hand, and order another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert a spatula, whose shape is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find it where it is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left hip: and let the section be above that stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let a transverse section be made, so that the outward section may be wide, and the inward one narrow, according to the quantity that it is possible for the Stone to exit from it no greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger which is in the anus compresses a stone at the site of the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from the stone there are those which have corners and margins, wherefore it is difficult an exit because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from that it is soft, like a gland, and round: and an easy exit is made of it.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore to him who has angles and margins, add to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out this way, then it is necessary to make a handle over it; or bind it with a strap properly, whose end is like the Moon, which binds upon the Stone and does not run away from it; or to insert a subtle instrument under it, of curved end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot lift it above, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something from blood overcomes you, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If, however, there are more than one stones, then drive the largest one first to the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterward thrust a little behind it: and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is large, then ignorance is such that a cut should not be made on it.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it happens to the sick one of two things, either that he will die or that there is constant dribbling of urine, because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or use instruments in its fracture with forceps until you extract it piecemeal.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense and aloe and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, that a hot abscess may sit.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the patient flat on his back, and do not loosen the ligatures until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with dyacinion ointment and basilinum ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a hot abscess occurs in a wound, and corroded, and similar things: such as if blood clots in the bladder, and urination is prevented from it: and this is known by the egress of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its decay.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply of every kind with that which is fitting for healing, until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the course of healing the whole wound, that you lay down two thighs, and join them together, because of the medicines which are placed upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and is in the urethra and lodged there, and prevents the passage of urine: then take care of it with that which I have told you before you come to the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often you will be excused from making incisions through this cure, for I have now proved that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you receive a perforator from iron alferic, whose this is the shape, of triangular extremity, acute, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with a stick under a stone so that it does not return to the wound.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the rod with ease until the perforator reaches the stone; and revolve the perforator in the stone with your hand gradually; and try the perforation of it until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Urine is indeed completed immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the staff.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	He himself breaks and comes out with urine, and the sick man is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then bind a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry over a stone in the very stick between two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, dissolve the ligament, and cleanse the coagulated blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, except that it may not return to the vessel: and another thread from above, except that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin may return to its place, and cover the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you raise the skin upwards, that it may return to its proper place, and cover the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of the stone from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXIX.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stone is produced rarely in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If someone should suffer from one of these stones, then it is a difficult cure and is forbidden because of many ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that a woman may perhaps be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is because you do not find a woman who will unveil herself to a physician when she is chaste, or among those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third reason is that you don't find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with her hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the stone's place: therefore, a deep incision is needed, and there is fear in it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity compels one to this, then it is necessary to take a female physician, well-knowing; and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you do this first, then seek a chaste, subtle physician and present the woman to an experienced midwife who is well-versed in women's affairs, or a woman who acknowledges having some knowledge of this art: do this, and especially instruct her to perform everything that you prescribe to her based on the examination of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, it is necessary to see if the woman is a virgin. Then it is necessary for him to insert his finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore he finds it, he shall constrict it under his finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the womb of the weak one, and inquire about the stone after she has placed her left hand upon the abdomen, and compresses it with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower regions with the utmost skill until he comes to the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts above it at the opposition of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whatever part it is prepared, and feels for the stone in that part: and his finger does not move away from the stone, pressing under it: and let the section be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts a probe above that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore he feels a stone, then he should add into the section according to the quantity proportionate to how much the stone comes out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stone.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these it is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, know its kind, as it will be signified to you by this above that which you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood conquers you, then add to the place of the wound crushed (something), and hold it for one hour until the blood stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and do as you have prepared with instruments which I said in the extraction of the stone in men, so that you may help yourself in your operation by them.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If you are defeated by a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and bind it with small strips of constriction adequately: and do not move it: and let go the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When therefore the sharpness of blood has subsided after days, and the place has decayed, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the cutting of an aquatic hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The ramex is not watery, but a collection of moisture in the white sifac, which is under the skin containing the testicle: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes there is in the fold of its own skin which nature has prepared for it in that part until it is thought to be: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white surface, which we have said: and this is not done except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And this generation of these branches is from weakness which happens to the testicles: therefore this matter is poured out unto them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Either its color slopes towards yellowness, or it is bloody red, or it is foul, black, or it is watery white, and this is the most common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	If there is in the white discharge what we said, then the abscess is round to a short length like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because moisture contains it on every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the own cloth, then the abscess is round with a part like an egg, and therefore a man thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white fascia, then it falls under sensation.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of humidity, then experiment with the color of humidity in an abscess with a square introduced, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to that which emerges in the track of introduction, judge of that which is between it and itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person to be bled if possible and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it is placed on its back, high up a little, and cloths are put under it behind.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and bid the minister to sit on his right, that he may extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the miraculous belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to near the pubis bone: and let a section be made according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane enclosing it; and scrape this and observe, or carefully avoid cutting into this, so as not to cut into it: and let your scraping be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and carefully examine with the scraping according to the quantity that is possible to you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce a syringe full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the scalpel upwards, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and cut the scrotum as you are able to cut it, either with its entirety or in parts, especially the subtle side of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there will be no safety in its incision, but water will return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however a foreign object proceeds from its cutting edge during the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the section of the knife, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it like other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted egg from another blackness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut away the testicle with its suspension ligament, and extract the sperm; afterwards take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: therefore dry the other part according to what you did in the other, equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it seems right to you that there should be one operation, then do so; then wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions wool immersed in oil, or in roseated oil: and place before the opening another wool which you have immersed in wine and oil, and expand it over the two testicles, and the miracle of the belly: and place above double cloths, and they are pouches: and tie them from above with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken and sewn together and filled with a carminative plaster according to this likeness: and the ends which press are made of wool or wet wool: and they are gathered with the bandage in the loin cloth: and one end receives over the anus up to the back, and the second receives at the side of the breast: and the two ends above the two lower hips, and the two other ends above the two groins, and the whole bandage is gathered together in the loincloth.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this ramus is treated artificially with a cautery at the site of the incision with an iron; and it is, that you take a subtle cauterizing knife, and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it is ignited, according to what we have narrated: until when it reveals a white sifac containing water; then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It is like the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that, and ignite it until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the scalpel with hooks and scrape with a fine burning cautery, and cut into it as far as you are able until you have eradicated the whole of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware from egg, lest it touch fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is healthier and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, it causes you opposition during the time of incision or cauterization, a hot abscess, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you cure what causes opposition to you from that with the care which is suitable for it, according to what has been said before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If however the patient is fearful and does not wait for this operation because of its horror: then administer the perforation according to what I narrate it: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is made certain to you by that which we have said about the significations, that a branch is watery: then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upon an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until water runs entirely through it.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a pad over the usual location and tie it, and allow it to run off any remaining water; then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, the resistance is to the exit of water at the hour that you perforate it; and this is not except because the white flesh opposes resistance in the orifice of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you must insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydrops is drawn out, whose form precedes: or add a little more to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and gathers together after six months, or about those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it is aggregated, then it shall be returned according to the same manner, and the sick person shall pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of fleshy branches (gangrene).
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the cutting of this branch, there is fear leading to harm in many cases.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me his dismissal from it is salutary.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in bodies, of which are composed the testicles: and this is caused by many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from excess of acute, or sharp, which flows down to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or by percussion.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of an abscess is according to the color of the body, and pain is not found in it, and it is a severe abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, which is brown in color, and has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the tying of arteries, and their inflation: as has already been said in its recollection: or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, what is from them from the inflation of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That which is done from the inflation of veins, does not scatter anything among the compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that a section may be made on this kind and on the remaining flesh; and it is as if one were to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then stretch the ovary upward and remove it with a white cloth; and free the ligament from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the ovary.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg has become consolidated with those fleshy parts born, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg and cut into it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if adherence is between something from the siphon, or in that which is between vessels: then it is necessary that you free all of that adherence, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, the birth of flesh is in the place of adherence which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut all of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool steeped in rose oil, and wine; then take care of it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the care of branches, which is with the vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A boil is an abscess wrapped in some kind of wrapping, similar to a bottle gourd, with the softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult for the weak person to move and exercise, and to walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure of this illness there is fear, on account of the recollection of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Truly it is necessary, that we say the operation in this according to what the first did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the testicle suspension downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the assistants who are near the staff: and let another person hold it, and extend it with strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a broad, sharp spatula, transversely across the direct vessels until they are revealed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape from every part, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards fix in them a needle in which there is a thread double, and bind it in the first place where the wounds occur: and bind it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry that in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and remove what is gathered from moist, foul, rotten excretions.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for a wound as with the treatment of other wounds, in which the desire to generate healthy tissue is so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles may fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not bad for that reason.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If it happens that the vessels are all cut, then it is necessary that they be extracted along with the testicles; so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment because of the incision, and does not waste away or become scorched, and is not helpful with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of intestinal strangulation.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXVIII.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The occurrence of this is from a section, which happens on an incision extended over the abdomen in the groin region out from the navel.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a hernia or an extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds occur from many causes. Or by percussion. Or by jumping. Or with a shout. Or by elevation of a heavy thing, and the like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	This is what happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal to the depth, because the siphon compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign when it is from the cutting of the sifach, because it causes a violent pain to happen suddenly from its beginning: and it is a different abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with a loop of intestine: and this is called Intestinal Ramp, and loop: and sometimes it is done with windiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces runs into the intestines and is retained there: and this is harmful to the sick man because it causes bad pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the cure of these kinds of illness with iron there is fear: therefore it is necessary that one should be cautious about the case in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you instruct the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand into the cavity of his body, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then, he is laid on his back over his neck between your hands: and raise up his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upward, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the section be according to the quantity, as much as is possible, that an egg may come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the skin of the testicle, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when it reveals white, hard scrotum from every part: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white scrotum, which is under the skin, and the secondary scrotum, and separate with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the testicle.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white cloth upwards, with your left hand: and raise the testicle with the cloth to the part of the incision: and order your assistant to extend the testicle upwards: and you alone loosen the adhesion which is behind complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And feel with your fingers so that nothing is there from the intestine wound up in the hard white cloth.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If you find anything from it, then drive it toward the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a coarse thread made of ten threads; and introduce it into the last sifach, that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles following the section: then cut the ends which protrude from the thread until there are four strands.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others with a shape in the form of a cross; and tie them with alsifac, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin ligament of the testicles, until it can not allow any of the vessels that nourish them to send anything to them: so that there will not be a hot abscess.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the ligament second outside the first ligament, distant from it less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments are released from the siphons, which is under the skin of the testicles, the quantity of the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely according to its roundness, and take out from it the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry the lower part of the skin of the scrotum with a section from which blood and pus flow, as we have narrated previously.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and administer the ligature which we have narrated.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sifach, which we have said, is cauterized after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	It happens often indeed.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let the ligament go, until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case of him is delayed, then it shall be embrocated with hot water: and place upon it that which we said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the wound care, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	On a windswept branch.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this text no one has dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it is done as we narrated in the branch which is with the Vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as you cut the bowel after sectioning, bring it down easily; then dry it in the middle, and finally take care of it with what opens it until the bowels fall out. And take care of the wound, according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Of the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is small, and returns every hour; but if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the siphash, until the intestines descend into the siphash.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the siphon, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	This is because it extends, ifach; then it softens, and the place suppurates, and swells.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as his narrative preceding this has stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with a knife, in this way: and let the sick person lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture and abscess and prominent, by a cut across, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the forceps and those that are under the skin until when the white sifach is revealed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a probe, and place it over the prominent location from the sifach, and press it deep into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then suture two prominent places above the end of the radius from the shaft, and connect one with the other with a suture; then remove the end of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the intestines at all, nor pull out the bowel, nor anything else, just as I have taught you in the treatment of a rupture in the intestines.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then take care of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	If the incision is contracted, and no prominence is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And a cautery is better in this place; because it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles becomes soft in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them softens and its appearance is defiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked about the cure of this, that he make the one lying on his back, and cut the whole skin which has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he will bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, sew in the first excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds, until they heal and the threads fall away.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and for this reason it was permitted to me that I not remember it in this my book: and it is not necessary to remember it, except for two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when he is asked about it; and that he may know the cure for him who has it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another way is, that we often need the castration of some animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by rubbing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Either through incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by friction, the way of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by incision and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut above every egg with a single incision, until when two eggs proceed: then cut them after you have scraped both, and do not put anything on them except a fine plaster, which is over vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better because it is done by attrition: for perhaps attrition leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	On the treatment of hermaphrodites in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of these is because it appears where the following space is, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine runs out from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women there is one kind, and it is the vulva of the woman above the comb like the testicles of a man small entirely, protruding to the outside: one of which is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut the added flesh until the impression of it flees.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of the treatment of the remaining wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second kind of men, from which urine exits, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	On the incision of the labia and prominent flesh in women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps a growth is added above the natural thing, until its appearance becomes foul and ugly: and sometimes it is magnified in certain women so much that it expands like that in men, and comes even to intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you ought to hold the superfluity of Tentiginis with your hand, or with a hook, and cut into it; and do not cut to the end, especially in the deep part of the root: so that there does not happen a flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Flesh that has grown is flesh which is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges to the outside according to the likeness of a tail; and because of this some first call the ailment taillessness.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that we should cut into it as we cut into a hernia and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of an ulcus al raticum, which is a non-perforated female ulcer.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The vulva of a woman should be unperforated, or have a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is an illness which precedes that pain; and it happens either from flesh added (to the body) or from something fine and thin, or thick: and it happens either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it; and it prohibits intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it also prohibits menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it is obtained by the appearance of the midwife, if the labor pains are apparent and near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If it is not appearing, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the abscess is from a fine fistula and is near the two lips; then hasten, and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place small wads over the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force until the subtle siphon is ruptured and the opening is revealed.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the site: and let the woman every day apply it so that the site does not congeal with another.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the sifeh is large and thick, then it is necessary that one cut it with a spatula wide like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If the boil is born from flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it open. And let there be with you medicinal agents that will stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and also a mass mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a lead pipe wide so that the wound does not close quickly, hold it for several days; and administer a lint from dry linen, then cure the rest as usual until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes birth occurs in the womb of other flesh: it is therefore necessary that they be cut according to this mode: while there is no cancerous abscess, for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, let there be no opposition with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahel, and red boils in all women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are openings of veins, until much blood runs continuously from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become old, they become boils: and I have already said in the division of their kinds, and signs of them: and I will say here what they receive from their cure, and what not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to the sense, then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Those which are from them in the opening of the womb upon which sense falls are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the atheroma with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut it from its roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then pulverize over them at the flow of blood from one powder of incisions without corruption: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and so on, and similar things to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then he drives his feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterward place it in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the blood flow persisted, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and the rind of pomegranate, and roosters, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood is cut with it, that is good: and if not, make it adhere to the back with winds and nipples, without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is aglaster, Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the lion's [wound].
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the abscess rests, then care for the place with ointment until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	The barth is also like the head of an alhaasse, and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said in the beginning equally: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	On the perforation of the uterus which occurs in pregnancy.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stone abscess, and ulcers, and inflamed spots, and blisters, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed I have already said all these ailments and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about an abscess that occurs in the womb when it is from abscesses which collect pus, and you will want to know how its opening with a knife is done.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you ought to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of an abscess at its beginning is acute with percussion, and with heat, and fever; and you see it red: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: but care for it with that which helps on maturation, until when the sharpness of accidents rests.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit upon a seat which leans on two seats, and reclines, or rests on her back, and brings her feet to the lower part of the abdomen: and let her hips be expanded, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side and administer the instrument that opens the opening of the womb.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose shape comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fasten it with a rod deep into the matrix of the woman; so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and does not harm the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If, however, the instrument is more than deep, then it is necessary to put little pellets on the roof of the deep womb: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the deep womb may be prevented; and it is necessary for him to place a whorl, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side; and so that he may hold the instrument, and so that the minister may turn the whorl until the deep womb opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore it appears Exitura, and is touched by hand, and is soft and yielding: then it is necessary to cut the same at its head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a linen cloth submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the linen cloth, and draw out the incision deep in the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place the outer part over the mattress, and over the wool comb submerged in water, in which malvae have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is enemaed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long asarone has been boiled; then return to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If a wound has hidden itself within the uterus, then it is necessary to prohibit healing of it with iron, indeed care for it with that which we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Obstetrical Doctrine, how embryos that are living are treated, according to the form not natural produced.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXXVI.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for an obstetrician to know first of all the shape of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, the signs of this are that when you see a woman being compressed to the lower parts, and she desires to smell the air, and is lifted up by what is above her from childbirth, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is above its head, and secondary with it; or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that the belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon his head, it descends in second place with him, and is cleansed from those superfluities by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Whoever is beyond this birth, is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or it emerges with its head and hands: or it emerges with its belly: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar things from these admirable figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the mind is in each, and it is signified by that, and stands upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges from its head during its natural birth, and it becomes violent against the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see the strength of it already weakened: then make her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her; and vapors of willow with fennel boiled, and with humid oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts a small spatula between her fingers, and finds with it the second one, and cuts it with her nail until it runs which is in it of moisture; and presses the woman’s belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not descend, then a woman should be administered an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then command him after the enema that he be compressed: and make him sneeze with the ointment, and hold his mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will immediately emerge.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus protrude first, it is necessary to join them so that you may reduce them gradually with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not yield upon entry, then place the woman upon a seat and elevate her feet upward; then strike the seat against the ground: and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the impact.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies: then cut them open, and remove the residue of the fetus: and bind the hand of it with cloth, and remove it with equality: for itself will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the fetus upon its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges on its feet, it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards level it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then he shall take one of his feet and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When therefore they proceed as far as the hips, then order him to be compressed and make him sneeze with a condition; for he will emerge, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not exit as we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will then exit by an easy passage.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If this be prohibited with all that we have narrated: then take from the mucilage of aloe, and sesame oil, and gum dissolved: and beat all in a mortar with good percussion; then apply it with linen to the belly of a woman, and below her navel.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she feels a sensation of heat below the navel.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that the lower parts are now heated, then make a cataplasm of myrrh for him and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore one holds it for an hour, then make him sit upon a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and close his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the abdomen with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the pus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this form, then he will apply his hands little by little while introducing them.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then she is turned over onto her neck, and her feet hang down below; and she lies on a bed, and folds her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press upon his belly gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under his feet from the dust and debris until it is prepared on the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take its feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypogastrium gradually until the fetus ascends upwards.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he shall put his hands in, and gently bring forth the fetus; and bid the woman to compress until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging lengthwise from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	He will be skilled in the setting of a hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If, however, he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman up, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If he cannot walk, then have him lie on a bed: and beat his legs with violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from poultices.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she receives it in childbirth, then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study in the reduction of the hand, and equal fetuses according to the natural figure: and make a woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The fetus came out on its neck, with outstretched hands, and its face was towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the fetus in her hand and then turn it gradually, and make it even with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is made equal, then place on top of its surface that which we have narrated from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command him to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make her sit upon a seat, and command her to incline to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command him to be compressed: and make him sneeze with it.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The prepared fetus is laid on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this way with the second instrument, then split the second instrument with your finger until it is evacuated from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then drive the fetus inward until you place it as is necessary; and command the woman to compress herself several times; for he will then come out by a light exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	Exitus of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are born many times; and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	Nevertheless, this is foreign and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	There are five things outside of nature and they do not live at all: and it contains them, even if they multiply, according to one: and they are separated by a siphon, distinguishing among them the ligament in the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge as a fetus emerges from the natural exit, easily; and they emerge from the praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of these are difficult during childbirth and they come to what we said from unnatural figures, then care for them as we narrated: and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and devise according to every figure with that which is prepared for her from skillful guidance to safety.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarried.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has already been verified to me that a woman, aborting, emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	What was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all of this ought to be in the knowledge of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will come to him as similar to that one: therefore let him oppose it to it as is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter Seventy-Sixth.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the division of medicine, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted with any of those things from which perdition may be feared upon her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid upon a bed on her back, and her head be inclined downwards, and her legs elevated: and let the minister hold her by two parts, or be fastened to the bed, so that her body may not be drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the maternal bone with oily moisture along with marshmallow and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and pastes; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then he will seek out with it a place where he will put hooks from the fetus, and suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider therefore then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its collarbone, or in places near the ribs, and under the pubic bone.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is upon his feet, then in the hip bone and ribs of his middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he hold the hook with his right hand and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of his left hand and introduce it with his hand easily and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until it comes to the empty thing.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then place another hook opposite it, or a third if necessary, so that there is equal contraction and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and not be an extension according to straightness only, but rather be moved to every part, so that its exit is relieved; just as it is done when a tooth is removed.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that what is between them be softened in extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part is held from it, then the midwife must anoint some fingers with oil and introduce them from the side so that she may turn what is held with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then let the hooks be changed to a higher place; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand goes out before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its constriction: then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then withdraw it until the whole thing comes out, cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow: and thus you ought to do with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If, however, the fetal head is large, or it is constricted in its exit, or there is water gathered in its head: then it is necessary that he put a Spatula between his fingers, and find with it the head, and extract the water; or break it open with an instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise, if the fetus has a large head, then it is necessary to cut through the soft tissues; or extract it with forceps, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head should protrude and be bound at the fork: then it should be found until the moisture which is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not become complicated, nor yield to an outcome: then cut the head piecemeal, as far as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If a boil or hydrops is in the lower abdomen, then it must be lanced until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If, however, the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is constricted near the abdomen or chest: then you must extract it with the cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and press upon the abdomen, or chest, until that which is within them heals.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, the other limbs are removed and the head returns, then the midwife shall insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the birth canal is open, then he shall insert his hand into the depth of the womb, and with it seek out the head, and draw it up with his fingers to the opening of the birth canal; then he shall insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it up with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the womb is contracted because of a hot abscess that has occurred to it: then it is not necessary to labor over it, rather it is necessary at that time to administer an effusion of humid and fatty things: and apply poultices: and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible for it to be made level: then what we said about a live fetus should be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then cut in pieces and remove it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not let anything from the second cavity inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which happen in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If it happens that there is a flow of blood, then let it descend into water and styptics, and administer the rest of the cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself once saw a woman who had a fetus that was dead in her womb; then she became pregnant again over it, and afterward another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred for him at his navel, and it became swollen until it opened; and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore I was called upon to treat him, and I treated him for a long time: and the wound did not close.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore I placed upon it of certain plasters of strong attraction: and it came out from the place of the bone.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then after some days another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed then, since there is no mouth in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore I thought, because they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	Therefore I inquired about the wound and extracted many bones, with a woman being in better dispositions of herself. And now she has lived thus for a long time, and sends out a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not included this foreign work here unless because there is knowledge in it and aid for that which the skillful physician administers with his hand from healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of instruments necessary in extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the Squeezer, with which books are aligned, having two whirls on each extremity of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	Nevertheless this vertigo ought to be of a more subtle constriction, and it should be made either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the width of all the wood be like two fingers: and the margin of each of the two is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed on both sides, the length of which is a half palm and a little more: and the width of each of them is like two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn two whirls.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of dizziness which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, more subtle, and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see here above; and the length of the whole addition from these is like a palm: and the width of both is, two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the uterus with him, then do make the woman sit upon a bed, with her feet hanging down, with that which is between her legs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two adjuncts joined into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between his hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with an instrument, just as you do with forceps, evenly according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of Vertigo another which the ancients called Form of the Driving Force by which the fetus is driven.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, which is used to crush the large head: and it is similar to a forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which one cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of a small millstone used to crush the head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Shape of a wound having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The shape of tongs having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with serrated teeth, with which the head of a fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula has two extremities for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of two spatulas also sides.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all practiced, and the more they multiply in kind and are prepared by the craftsman, the swifter it is to their operation, and the higher it is among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, you should not despise from them an instrument, unless it is prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Their need is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the Extraction of the Second Tooth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second birth is retained, then it is necessary for you to order the weak one, that she may retain her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make him sneeze with the condice: and grasp your hand over his mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it comes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid; and put inside it herbs that open the matrix, such as calamentum, rue, and anise, and chamomile, and sage, and cassia wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a bundle of reeds over the opening of the pot's cover and the other end in the womb; and hold it until steam reaches the womb's cavity.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	Secondly, it will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this cure and does not come out: then order the Midwife, that she may submerge her hand in sesame oil, or fig sap.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he inserts into the wound and seeks with it the Second [region].
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore he finds it, then let him take it and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If it is attached deep within the womb, then he shall insert his hand, according to what we have narrated, until when he finds the Secundina, and draws it out gradually according to straightness, so that the womb does not fall down at vehement traction: indeed it ought to be turned with ease to the right and left sides; then add in the quantity of traction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it then obeys, and is kept, and departs from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the uterine bone is constricted, as we have already recounted: cure it with sneezing and from medicine of the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then beware of tiring yourself in repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed it is necessary that what issues from the mouth of the womb be brought up to the hip of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then administer an enema with a tetrapharmakon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For indeed it will rot it after days, and dissolve, and it will go out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Nevertheless, when it putrifies, a bad smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some ancients already tested fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument for fumigation used for a woman during retention of the Second (menstruation) and monthly flow.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make a mold like alum from glass or from clay: and put the broad end over fire: and let fumigation be placed over prunes: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born with their anuses unperforated, whom already a subtle hand has repaired.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, let the midwife perforate that siphon with her finger; and if she cannot, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the blade, so that it does not touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however you fear that it should be filled with pus, then put a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it when the boy wants to heal.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now it happens that suppuration of the anus also occurs from the healing of a wound, or from an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary that the consolidation be cut, then it be treated with that which we said from the cure and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower region are Knots and Lumps that happen near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and there is one fistula, or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that knot becomes obsolete, it is opened, and a white watery humidity or a subtle pus runs out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are fistulas penetrating from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore they are recognized as penetrating by what comes out with the excrement and wind, when the sick person uses the excrement; and perhaps it comes out of them worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are of these fistulas when they are in space penetrating as far as the bladder and as far as the male organ's urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they penetrate up to the hip joint and up to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this it is known that a fistula penetrates to the anus, even a non-penetrating one, is, as you insert your index finger into the anus: and you insert a fine probe into the fistula from bronze, or iron: when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twisting in it, then introduce into it a thin leaden probe or a horsehair needle until you feel the probe or needle with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it fully, and nothing proceeds from the hole through excretion, nor windiness, nor worm as I said; then know that it is not penetrating. Therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, then its significance is the exit of urine from it, and the prohibition of this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that it reaches by touch up to there, if there is no crookedness up to the bone; and the finding of pain around the area, and that pus always flows from it; and that medication does not help it, nor does it solidify with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas penetrating every thing there is no cure at all: and the treatment of them is labor and vanity to him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that one which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a clamp, according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it: and it is, that the sick person lie between your hands on his back: and elevate his legs up to his hips, and let his hips be inclined to his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then they introduce a probe of lead, or of iron, if there is a winding in the fistula, until you know where it reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If he feels it weak near the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel in your finger a wound that has already penetrated itself, besides which you feel between your finger and the skin, or flesh; then therefore know certainly, that it is penetrating: do not therefore labor on it, because it is not its healing, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that flesh is healed in some people and from the medicine which is expected to help it, it is to burn a subtle cauterium fire according to the width of the fistula, as it preceded, and introduce it burning into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice, or thrice, until you know that all those added, filtered meats, which are like the quill of a bird’s feather, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for it with linens wrapped in butter, until those burnt flesh parts have come out; then care for it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never healed with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it proceeds forth the probe, and does not reach to your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick veil of flesh, or sifac: and you see a fistula in that which follows the skin's surface, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the probe's extremity arrives, and the probe is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh pieces, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If blood overcomes you, and loosens between you and your operation so that you cut those flesh: then it is better that which is done, and more rapid help, to cauterize it with fire, or with medicine sharp.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cautery with fire gathers good properties, the burning of those added flesh, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of moistures.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it by wrapping it with licenses in butter, or crushed cabbage, until the place emits pus and those burnt flesh parts come out into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then the wound is treated with ointments that are hardening and flesh-producing; and there are medicines which contain astringency and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however fistula has already arrived as deep into the anus, and lengthens from the superfluity of the body: then introduce your finger into the anus, and inquire with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a wound, and between you and it is a veil of linen, or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in one of three ways: either that you cauterize it, as we said; or that you cut it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a ligature, and treatment from next.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with the incision, so that you do not cut the ligament containing the anus, and it happens over the weak exit of excretion without volition.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will heal: or lengthen the wound itself, and clean it after drying it almost to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of sharp extremity.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the incision, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with a section and an upper opening where it is healed, and let the fistula remain open on the inner part of the anus, and be lighter above the weak.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes a fistula is treated in this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula. And it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and edge of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an awl, that is, a prepared hide, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a thread wrapped from five threads, and about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce a probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it is penetrating into the margin of the anus inwardly near, then withdraw the thread from that opening: so that you introduce your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and gather together the two ends together: and tighten both, and release it on one day, or two days: and the more the thread sinks into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshes which are between the two ends of the thread sink in, and fall: then take care of the wound, until it consolidates, and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in any way that you prepare for yourself, unless it is deep in the body much.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you should not do that for a wound so that you do not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of a knife used to make an incision for a fistula, the sharpness of which is very acute on one side and not acute on the other so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows out upon their incision: and the care of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter Eighty-One.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are inside the rectum, similar to bundles of charcoal, or like plums; or as if they were grains of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of these there are small ones and large ones: and blood runs from them always, and it is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are, for the most part, few in moisture, from which flows yellow water, or a small amount of blood with constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the cure of it which is inside the anus is that you order the sick person to strain, and let it be expelled until it comes out of the anus, and appear before you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they are not held by the hooks because of their moisture and softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a swab from double wool, and remove them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them open and pulverize upon them after the incision some hot powders so that they may stand in their place as cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the old woman does not obey the evacuation, then administer to the sick person a clyster with a small opening so that it may be washed with what is in the anus, and it will obey evacuation quickly when the sick person expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however they are external from the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is as if you would take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we have said until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if he shuns cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture of them according to this mode.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a thread wrapped up, and introduce it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw out the athelil upward, and make it penetrate with a point into its root from the other side: and involve both extremities of the thread, at the lower part of the point, and let them be laterally: and tighten the athelil tightly with a strong constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and withdraw the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all atheriel, and let go from them one: nor its own, so that it may run out of it superfluity of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place upon the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cedar oil, and place it upon the anus: and command the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let him go until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore they fall (atheletic), care for them with ointment, and the rest of treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often such things happen from the drying up of feces and the constraint of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become ancient and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and remove from them the upper skin which prevents their consolidation.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they are consolidated as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not solidify: then treat them again with more intense heat than the first, until they bleed much, and are then scraped, and take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inversions of the Almirmar, both inverted and not inverted: and of Athil's scissors, and of Ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it happens in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and pain occurs in them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut and held with forceps or a hook, and be eradicated from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that, and if you wish cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From a certain type of smooth, hard substance there is one small eminence, rough and filtered, round upon the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And many times happen in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its cure is that you extend the atheril and cut it: or bind it with silk thread: or with hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now the athelil are eradicated, both inverted and not inverted with the instrument which I shall say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	An ant's hill is also a small elevation, coarse, on the surface of the body, penetrating deep inward; and when it finds cold, it feels like an ant bite in it, and it happens throughout the body; and most of it happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is, that you take a tube from the feather of a goose, or a strong vulture's feather: and place that tube over the Ant, until it contains a circle of the tube from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with a probe until you cut what is around the ant hill; and place it in the deep flesh, and root out the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, make it with a tube of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the tube be drawn upward with a covering that is silent, so that the grip on the finger is relieved and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize a Formica according to what was said previously about the cauterizing of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the shapes of instruments that are administered to the womb in diseases of the anus, and the solution of the belly, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a clyster is made from silver, or from brass, or from melted copper, or hammered copper.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore what is administered in the healing of young children should be small, and those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too their perinea.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small bladder.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The tube of it, that is, the upper part in which the uterus is bound, should be wide according to this measure: and let there be a distinction so that the uterus may be tied as you see, and its lower end which goes into the anus, be closed, that is, not open, smooth, soft, gently drawing to subtlety: and on one side of it there shall be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the opening be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and let it be in which medicines are placed from the bladder of an animal; or from sheep's gut, which is according to the shape of a small asophragmus: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it shall be perforated with many holes as it is revolved, and let the space which is between every hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those openings a strong thread made from raw yarn, which is of ten threads or thereabouts, and gather it with it the uterus as if you were using a suture.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in the uterus, it is tightened at the head with a clamp between two distinguishable constrictions with strong pressure.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer an enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of the womb here depicted, and the hole.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the clyster is this: that you fill the rectum or bladder with medicine, which shall be heated according to the quantity tolerated by the patient; and beware lest it be too hot, or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient is laid on his back, and his legs are raised to the upper part; and underneath him a cushion, that is, leather upon which men lie, or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the extremity with oil, or with albumen of egg, or with the mucus of fenugreek, or something similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take the rectum with both his hands and press it with force until he expels everything that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clyster and let the sick person elevate his legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine compels him to an outcome, then he should hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more ultimate in healing.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If you give him enemas in ailments of the stomach, and his death hastens: then repeat the enema until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or painful boils in the anus, then a gentle and fine enema should be used, such as those with which children are given enemas.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of enemas for a strict skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the cure of wounds of the head without fracture of bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have said in the division of wound care as was fitting for the book, and I will say here treatment of them with hand and with medicines according to completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say, that wounds differ according to how they are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the things by which wounds are made very often are such as: throwing of a stone; or cutting with a sword or knife; or striking with a spear, or wood, or arrow; and similar things from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or leg: and similar ones from those limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may set forth that reasoning and rule over the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I begin with simple wounds of the head: for the recollection of compositions will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	Therefore I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a wound occurs on the head that is simple and there is no bone fracture: consider then if it is from a stone throw, or something similar, and already has broken only the skin; and it is a large wound, and fear the bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay this: and draw out of the blood according to the quantity of its virtue: if nothing forbids phlebotomy, especially if it is the blood that flows from the wound little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let bloodletting be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick one beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prevents diminution, then it should be reduced from food and not approach meats or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if it happens to have a hot abscess, rose oil infusion alone, or with wine that has astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are sure about a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and has not changed the air, the powder which I will tell you about shortly; and if it has already changed the air, then place some ointment on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its lips do not come together by their own accord, then gather them together with suture, according to what I will tell in wounds of the belly about the suturing of them.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If now a wound has been detected from bone, and it hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension; then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore the hardened flesh in place of the skin, and order the sick to be fed with foods that have thickness, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge; and things similar to this.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find in the skin putrefaction, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut out the entire putrefaction, and throw it away: then take care of it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and it is not severed by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a spatula, or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity demands when that which we said does not avail, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small, simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that one puts this powder upon them: because it solidifies them before they change in air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Mode of Incarnate Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt quicklime: mix all together well, and sift it; and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good constriction until it adheres well on top of it, and clots with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it above with pads and let it go, and do not loosen it until it remains, so that it does not burst out.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not eradicated from it until it heals.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes it does this alone with lime, when you do not have frankincense at hand, and dragon's blood also does the same operation in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to place it on them and tie them up, and there are recent wounds with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If it has already been changed by some kind of change, especially when it is in summer time, then there is no point in the position of this powder: therefore take care of it with what we have said, so that you place over it some unguents digestives: or place over it poultices made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If however it happens with a wound a fracture in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with Gesti: and I now say the cure of fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound on the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If a nerve of the neck or an artery has already been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no need to treat it except with something that causes strong clotting, such as ziniar, zegi, and similar substances.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For they harm the nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold upon the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is most exalted of the limbs; and let it be healed with medicines gentle, such as lime washed with sweet water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil, and myrrh, and when washed also with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones, according to this manner, and humid ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or tie together its edges with splints.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the depth of a wound is great, or if there has formed a pocket in the lower part of it, into which pus already gathers, then pierce it at a more depressed spot therein.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If an artery has already been cut in a wound and its blood flow has begun, then separate it, or dry it out, and tie it up; or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, a spine has already fallen into the throat, or the whole of it, and the alhaudegi have been saved: then gather together the lips of skin with suture above the throat tube, and do not touch the throat, but rather equal it, and reduce it back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the constriction gently, and let it go for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment which contains astringency and drying properties, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If now the wound has made an impression on bone, then examine it; and if there are fragments of bone in it, remove them all or as many as you can. And what cannot be prepared, leave it, until the wound putrefies and the exit of it separates and becomes easier.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then apply the powder which I have described on top of it.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, a fistula is formed in a wound and bone is visible, then care for it should be done according to the chapter pertaining to its remembrance.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	On a wound in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore from the wound there issues windiness, when he breathes out from it weakly, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is recent with its own blood: then do not place powder in it from the first hour, nor bind it tightly so that blood is not held in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the weak one: but place ointment on it, attractive, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If ointment is not present to you, then put in the wound opening old wool, so that it draws out what comes forth from it of humors; and make that the sick person sleeps upon the wound, so that it may cure what is gathered in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, three days or more have passed since the wound and no spasm has occurred to the injured person, nor any bad fluttering of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of his dispositions good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, care for the wound itself and with permission, and the rest of the care, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, healing is excluded and it always opens, then know that a fistula has already been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, care for it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if a wound is from the cut of a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or back: then care for it with that which preceded regarding sutures, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If it has already made an impression in the bone, and a fragment has broken out of it, then examine the wound, and quickly proceed to remove those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If, however, they are not separated, then let them be left alone until the wound has rotted away, for it will be easier to extract them afterwards.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment in the cure of the remaining wounds, in the remaining limbs, is that which we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On wounds of the abdomen, and the exit of the intestines, and their protrusion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	A rupture that happens to the belly is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From this great sometimes a intestine exits, or number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore it is made an introduction of them, and their suture more difficult and harder.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even a small disruption can be difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that the reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten in its introduction to its place immediately; because it becomes inflated, opens, and increases: therefore, its entrance becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a middle disruption is better for ruptures because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the vulva is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are used in the suture of the abdomen and in the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Nevertheless, they are more proper with suture of the abdomen: and I tell you each one with an explanation and a declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore I say, that when a wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is because of one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore this is so, then it is necessary that you heat it, so that you may submerge a sponge, or a piece of cloth, wet in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with a little squinant, and cypress, and spice, and embrocations with it, the intestine, until the swelling resolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes it makes a wine that has astringency; and it is better than water alone in resolving swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the swelling already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the lettuce, or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that it will be relieved the entrance of it with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, his return is excused after this cure, then find in the disruption a little, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and the lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be curved, pointed, and the other part blunt, and the slender tip not be as slender as a spatula, but rather a little more blunt: and this one that resembles a hoe, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that there be a reduction of it according to its natural form in its own place, if it is possible above it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When a rupture is wide in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head and chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your attention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it is necessary that you administer this to large wounds and to medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, place it as it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a pious minister present between your hands, who will hold the entire disruption with his hand: and gather together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it something after something for him who follows the suture; and this is the manner of a common suture of one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you may take a knife, or number of knives according to the quantity of width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then release from the edge of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, the surgeon's: and fix a needle aside from which you insert a thread in the two ends of the skin, with the two ends of the sifac which is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already gathered together the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the sifac: and four orders are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then bind with a doubled thread around the wound's edge several times from two parts together, until the two lips of the wound are joined by a decent union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of the finger also, and place another point in them; afterwards sew it with a thread, just as you did with the first point.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore, do not cease doing this with him who needs it from the points, until you complete the tightening of the wound completely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium size between thickness and thinness: because very fine needles pierce flesh quickly; and thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin. Therefore, they ought to be of medium size in both thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that a needle be fastened in the two extremities of skin close together so that flesh may not be cut quickly and the wound may not open before its clotting, and also so that they are not elongated with suture so that the wound is prevented from clotting.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the bandage so that it does not harm the sick one in his sleep: and put on them pads from cloths from every part, which hold the ends of the bandages: and let them go until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it suffices in sewing them one needle, or two, or about as many.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second kind of suture is common, as it joins the edges with four sutures: two edges of skin and two edges of fascia in one place, with a needle on which is wound thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced with the point these four extremities, withdraw the point from the part where you began, so that the thread may fall from the upper part of the wound: so that it may be a suture, like a suture of cloth which is tightened on cloth, and put between each suture the quantity of thickness of less than one finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	These sutures are known to people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I sewed the wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a disruption of one palm's width: and about two palms had come out of the intestines from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I reduced it after 24 hours when his intestine stood outside the wound.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space which had been about fifteen days; and I took care of it, and it healed; and he lived after that for many years, conversed in his dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not be cured.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor anything from medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed upon the old wound a poultice twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I shall speak of two kinds of sutures proper according to the account of the discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, as you begin with a sharp suture: and introduce the point from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore a needle penetrates the skin and enters the flesh going according to the length and width of the whole body: let go the end of the needle on the side where you introduced the needle, and make it penetrate into the other end from the interior part to the exterior in the other extremity mirach.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity mirach from the external part to the interior: and let go the extremity sifac, which is in this side, and make it penetrate with a point into the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior: and make it penetrate with the penetration that you make it penetrate in the sifac extremity mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity which is from the other side, and extract the point from the skin that it has pierced.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into that skin, and suture its extremity which is on the other side with this extremity mirach. And extract it from the skin which is on its part, and make them together one, and the other: and make them together alternately, until you have brought all its exterior according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that you should bring its sutures to the skin as if they were skins: so that you should bring one part from one end of the skin and let go of it on the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of suture, which Galen called his own.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This discourse of his is narrated, so that he should make his according to the likeness, as some medicinal men do, so that they gather every part to its own corresponding part by nature: and apply one extremity of sifac to its other extremity, and one extremity of mirach to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you insert a pointed stake into the limb close to you from the outer part and cause it to penetrate to the interior within the flesh; and let go of the two ends of the stake.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then roll back the point and make it penetrate from the outside part to the inside in two extremities, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then roll both over, and make them penetrate both from the inside out to the two extremities called miracles which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of sewing is a better sewing than the common one, and it is the sewing whose previous account has been given.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also the saying of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the abdomen should be repaired with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, to introduce into both one thread: and begin with the introduction of a needle, from that which is at your hand, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when a rupture is in the middle of the abdomen: then its suture is more difficult than the rest of the places of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you find a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it: and you reduce the intestine, and your own, and fit it: then place on top powder of incense.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then put upon it some ointment that is present to you until they make pus and the threads fall away, and the wound closes and heals miraculously.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as is the care for other wounds until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If medicines are not present to you, then place upon it immediately, from where it begins to discharge pus, a poultice of old wool: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need another medicine in many conditions when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If you fear that the wound may communicate with the principal limbs in injury, then it is necessary to immerse a soft wool in oil tempered to moderate heat, or in rose oil; and place it around the places which are between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer a clyster with warm, black spiced wine: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and made an exitus penetrating to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing, and that which is from those things which are fine is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	The intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that happens in it at all; and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If however that which proceeds from the wound is a zizzer, and you pursue it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, the space has passed and it has already become green or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has darkened from it, so that blood flow does not happen.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In the wrist there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging ends of thread from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that the attraction above you will be lessened, and the extraction of it in the case of a boil, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A remembrance of a wound that happened in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When rupture occurs in the intestine and is small, it is possible that it can be restored in some people, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old. And a fistula was made, and excrement and wind came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I made treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; nor did I cease to treat him carefully, until he was healed and the place had been consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw that the place was already consolidated, I feared for the weak spot, that a misfortune might happen to him within his belly: and it did not happen to him from that misfortune.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and going to stool, and went into the bath, and exercised in his diets.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and is small, then it ought to be ligated according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, as you receive ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place a single ant from those which have an open mouth on top of the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore he seizes it above and clamps its mouth, cut off its head for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease doing this with an ant after each ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it and sew its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is fed and healed, and no further harm comes to the sick person.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible, that the intestine may also be ligated with a fine thread; which has been taken from the intestine of an animal, and attached to it after it has been introduced into the point (of the instrument).
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is, that you receive the end of this thread from the intestine, and that it be thoroughly cleaned.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then bind a thread of fine linen wrapped at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the point and sew with it the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then put it back together again.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with worms and intestine is nothing but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines, then there is no remedy except for cunning, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	On the treatment of Zuchemen and fistulae.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or abscess when it ages and becomes old, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and always emits pus, and is not cut away: then it is called universally wherever it is in the body a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	A fistula indeed is according to truth a knot filtered, hard, white: with which there is no pain, whose concavity is that of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And there are some hours which are moist, which discharge pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps moisture is split at certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is much, and sometimes little: and it is thick, and sometimes subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already stated in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, and no flesh is born in it, is not due to anything but one new cause.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these is due to the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its evil nature; or because between it and its upper lip there is hard flesh that prevents the birth of flesh; or because there is much dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its cure; or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence; or because of the property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where digestion of ailments is difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because it has one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have now shown you all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in division: and it is necessary here that I should make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For some of these are fistulas which reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or siphons; or to the intestine, or bladder, or to one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the joints composed: such as the hands and feet: and some of them run to the neighborhood of the principal member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, these fistulas, according to this manner, are from ailments of difficult healing, and do not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from fistulas of some depth which does not reach these places which I have said: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and you wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe made of bronze, or iron, if the fistula stretches along a straight line, and explore it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If there is a winding path in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead, because of the softness of its body, is lifted and bent around curves.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If a fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with your finger.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cleanse with a clyster each opening from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture that you introduce by clyster, flows through other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire carefully according to what way is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or a nerve, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or near; or whether it is one fistula which has many openings, and stand over all of it with your utmost strength: with your questioning, as you question the sick person, and by finding pain upon compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidental abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have stood over all these things truly, then go to the cure according to confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if there is a fistula near appearing, or in a place safe far from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then dry the fistula according to what has been said before from my narration, and remove that which is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, which is born at its opening from flesh, or thread, and similar things: and care for it, until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, a fistula is of great depth and is straight, then it is necessary for you to cut it in the depth as far as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse the same of all corrupt flesh from it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer a linen cloth rolled up in sharp medicines: and introduce it into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with iron: do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes everything that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal by that means, then cauterize it according to what we have recounted.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is ascertained to you: then inquire into that, and dry it according to what I have told you; if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore a bone is discovered by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it, until the whole corruption is removed from it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which has enveloped it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did: then you will know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, cleanse it again with care, and make a careful dissection of it, and its purification with your utmost fortitude.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If therefore it is healed, that is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in the depth far away of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	There is therefore no skill in you, except to let nature take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If a small bone is broken and it is possible for you, draw it together with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If there are many bones, then with great care attract them all, and release nothing from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something from the moistures does harm to you and there is no fear or error in their incision, then cut those moistures and the flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your hour, then place over the wound so that it may rot; and dismiss it until it has rotted what is around those bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And keep the wound so that it does not close.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the section that you cut in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	If you are afraid, place on top of this a pad soaked in sulfur rubbed with oil; or a pad soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other medicinal ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures, namely, rot, and the bones separate from them, the removal of them is relieved, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If it is a large single bone, such as the femur or hip bone, and similar to these, and that which has become corrupted from it is a large part, then carefully scrape it last until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If now that which is in it is corrupted, and the part is large, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it through, and to cut it entirely up to the place where it reaches corruption: then care for it until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a wound which happened to a man in his leg: that you may put this very example and help on your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years old to whom pain came in his leg, from a cause which was moved upon him within the body, that is, from the insides, until the matter went to the leg, and an abscess became a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time was extended with him due to the error of the doctors, until the abscess opened and many substances gathered around it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And after treatment had been applied to him, until the leg became ulcerated, and many openings were made in it: which all discharged pus, and the humors of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of the hand until I was called upon, and I saw his leg, and the materials which flowed out of those openings in great course: also the whole body of the man had become withered, and his color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore I introduced a probe into one of the openings and it reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I carefully examined all the openings; and found that they communicated with each other from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Therefore I prepared and cut into one of the openings until I found the part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Therefore I have shown what was discovered and prepared from corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I have shown that there was not in the bone anything other than that corruption which I cut out and sawed away.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed a restoration of the wound with solidifying medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not united.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I examined and discovered above the bone, second to the first discovery: and I found continuous decay with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me even from that decay.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I again examined it and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to try its restoration; and it was not restored until I cut out of the bone about a hand's breadth, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored him with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition of the operation and section on him was not necessary, except because of the disposition of weakness of the sick man, and his lack of endurance, and my fear for him about death; because he used to faint in every hour from the excess of evacuation.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore, he was healed completely: and in the place of the bone firm flesh grew, and a good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he turned back to his usual ways: and it did him no harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, the prominent bone in the place of the body has already been broken: then it is necessary that you bind it together, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament, and tighten it at the end of the prominent bone: and command someone who extends it upward: and put another ligament from wool thicker than the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the lower part: and you will uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to suture, so that it does not harm the saw by cutting the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a stick, or a board under the bone below in the center; because when you do this, it does not prevent cutting rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that a clamp be placed upon the place corrupted for a short time, so that there may not be corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it may not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compel to the clamp of its vice another thing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is broken and not protruding, but its part continues with that part; and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all parts altogether.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the lower wood.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, saw it on the first part, where is the corruption, until the sawing continues on the other part: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption a little, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If however corruption is in the junction of two articulations, then there is no skill in it except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is in the breast of the hand, or in the breast of the foot: then the matter is very difficult there.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And having scraped it, and cleansed it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever ingenuity it may be rectified for you: when it does not make opposition to you of Vein, or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that the cutting tools, and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the location of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and fineness, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that instruments suitable for each kind of operation be prepared.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you about the kind of instrument which you will need when it is a long study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the modes of this art is a testimony to the modes of illnesses: for then indeed you will find through yourself that which is suitable for it from instruments to every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am affirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will put examples upon which you will cut and proof which you will try on others.
Forma Serrae.	The Form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw, as depicted, is well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its arc be above, its sharpness from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidal in shape, made off-center.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of a knife for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped key: and its points be according to the shape of the points of the  elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not fitting, unless they are rubbed with it, heads of the joints, when they are corrupted, or a wide and large bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of the Greater Scalpel.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of a scalpel's middle.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of a broad scalpel.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of a scalpel which has a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of another fine razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of a lancet for another curved limb.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The form of the scalpel is small and fine blade.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of a chisel used for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape of the large scalpel also.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a chisel, and its extremity is like a saw: it is shown in many places from the sawing of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of a scalpel which is suitable for the cutting of something that has been pierced through from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	The extremity of it is triangular, and its points are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it is necessary that all things which we have said be done from razors, and incisions, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of extremities, and the setting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrify, either from an external cause, or from an internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have medicated that corruption with medicine, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption to affect the limb, which is not struck by anything: then it is necessary that you should cut into that limb until where the corruption follows, so that the sick man may be delivered through it from death, or from the evil which is greater than the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this is that the limb is darkened until it is thought to be burned by fire or rotting after blackening: until the rot comes down to that which follows the limb and creeps into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, it is proper to make an incision with it, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the sting of certain venomous things, such as a sea scorpion, and viper, and rattle snake, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore decay or percussion is in the extremity of the finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave space for the decay, so that it may go as far as the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger and do not close the space for corruption until it reaches the elbow.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades in it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however corruption passes through, and you see him about the arm: then there is death of the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And in addition to this from healing, is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do for the foot, when corruption has invaded the finger, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it seizes on the arch of the foot, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it except to release and leave the weak to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the manner of cutting a limb, or sewing it up is, as you would cut the ligament below, which you wish to cut; and tie another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let one minister extend a ligament downward: and let another minister extend a ligament upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is uncovered.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut, or sewn up.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you put linen from all parts, and let the saw not touch the healthy place: and let the infirmity added with an abscess happen.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If it happens that there is an internal bleeding while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or put some powders on top of it that stop the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable ligament, and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same thing that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is because it happened in his foot, blackness, when a burning which is assimilated to the fire's burning; and that corruption first happened in his finger, until it began the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore a man made use of himself after he had seen the corruption to fall upon his limb with violence of it, which he found from the pain and burning of it: and he cut it at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed for him, the same corruption happened to his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He therefore came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with what I had placed on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the superfluity was not recovered, and it began to move into another finger; until corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me to cut his hand: and I refused it, hoping for an outcome from me beyond the repercussions of that superfluity; and I also feared for him death upon the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For his skill was superior to that of others.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to pass concerning him that he hurried, and fell with his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought forward this account, except that it may be an aid concerning that which falls under the kind of this ailment: and that it may be a sign by which it is signified, and according to which it is treated.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the care of sinuses, and the nature of clysters with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a boil occurs in some fleshy limbs and the space of the boil is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and what is in it comes out of the pus, and a hollow place remains like a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has already been finely woven: and does not reach to the last stage of corruption, nor does it imprint on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: but if the space of it is prolonged until the corruption imprints itself on any of these limbs, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care of it is, that you cut that skin entirely as it turns over: and especially when it has been softened and made like cloth: and trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If you hope that it will adhere to the skin and not lead to that final corruption, and if there is thickness from flesh in the skin, then care for it with a clyster, and it is, as you consider, to the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus which comes forth from it is of foul smell: then clysterize it with an Egyptian remedy, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, parts receiving equal, are gathered into a vessel: and they are boiled over fire until the remedy boils: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the sinus with it. And close its opening, and let the medicine remain in it for the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression: do this for so many days until the sinus is purified and the stench is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is administered with water and ashes when this medicine is not present to you; and it is that you receive the ash of grape wood, or ash from holly wood; and you pour it over the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then treat it with a compress and use an enema until you are confident that the sinus has been cleared.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water of ash, then give him an enema with water and honey, to which has already been mixed something of ground zinjar.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cleanse him with an enema of honey and wine mixed together, because it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times and trust that the corruption of the sinus has already been removed: then irrigate it with that which causes flesh to grow there.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you may receive from the diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil, and stiptic wine: or clysterize it with certain medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the sinus is narrow, in which a clyster cannula does not fit; then enlarge it with a small knife: or place within it a linen cloth smeared with Egyptian ointment, or with basilica ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then gather its lips together with a suture: and release from it the quantity into which the clyster will enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening from which the pus runs is elevated upwards: then dry it out in a lower place that is in it, so that it may run from there downwards; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus approximately below it as you wish: then try to prepare the limb with preparation which will allow it to drain pus easily as it is being prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all; and take medicinal poultices which are placed over the wound, suitable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	Let a cloth be of such size that communication of the whole sinus is made.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps at the direct opening of the sinus foramen, a little wider than the opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the ointments gentle on another cloth, according to the amount of the hole: and place it above it in a position far from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be eased: and do not remove the large cloth, except after some days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is over the opening of the Sinus, is he whom you remove at every hour, that what accumulates there from pus may go out; and so that you may know, whether that which runs out from it is much or little; or digested or indigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And again with this consider the place of the sinus itself, whether the lord feels pain in it, or whether there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or whether there is not an abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is thus extended, and you see the material which comes out above the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus has already adhered, or approaches adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you have dissolved the wound, then change the other cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If a subtle virus emerges from the sinus after a long time, do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because some people delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If after many days undigested pus comes out of the sinus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed, and its process is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, truly make the physicians so that they are medicines in their substance humid, and in their virtue dry: such as unguentum dyafinicon, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And of the most final cure, it is, that you take ointment diyafinicum and dissolve it with rose oil, and return it upon itself old wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then make it with him and use it yourself.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now he does something similar to this action, when you do not have dyafinicon ointment at hand, honey, when you have boiled it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh and aloes and frankincense: pound the whole thing together, and pulverize it over honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then a line over the very cloth, and tighten it over the sinus: and a line with honey which you have cooked, until it has thickened; and pulverize on top of it spices, and put them on top of the cloth, and tighten it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes it is administered there, the long birthwort, and roots of celestial lily, and it is lily, and herb flour, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use these simple ones, or those that are combined, rub them and the strainers themselves; and pulverize above honey as I have narrated, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus condition persists and does not heal with this treatment: then know that there is corruption in its depths; or it has already made an impression on the bones, or the other hard members, or the ligaments; then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what was previously stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the treatment of a paronychia and an abraded nail, and on the addition of a finger digit, and on the cutting (open).
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCIX.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A pimple is an abscess that is born under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot: and perhaps it is born in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the matter is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes a hot abscess: or it rots, and discharges pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the extremity of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you care for a wound and what we said in the division is not useful, and your care does not help; then it is necessary that you cut with a knife the whole superfluity which remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after this.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	A cautery is indeed very useful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of the nail already press flesh to the inside, and begin to prick it, and harm it: then it is necessary that you put a thin radium under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upward: and cut that flesh with ease, and place on top of that which remains of the flesh from burning medicines, corrosive ones, until the whole of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If corruption has already set in on the bone, then it is necessary to cut into that bone and remove it; for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains there.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see decay and corruption progressing in the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what has been said before about its recollection.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, it happens that a nail be rubbed or struck and a severe pain comes upon it, then it is necessary for the surgeon first to blood-lett the affected person.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse section from top to bottom as desired.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard yourself so that the incision does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause a very violent pain to happen through it to the sick man, and it will be the cause for added flesh growth in its place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is fleshy throughout; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore he who is born in certain knots of the finger, does not move: and he who is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, it is easy to make an incision in that which of these is fleshy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, that you cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	The healing of one whose nativity is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In that one who is born with a fingernail at the last node, it is necessary to cut first the flesh of it with a round incision until the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw with one of those saws fitting for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation that occurs in the fingers of adjacency, often happens either from birth, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary that you cut away that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them linen cloths, or rags soaked in rose oil: so that they do not solidify too quickly, and separate between them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place has solidified as is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if it happens that a digit is fused with the palm, then cut that fusion, according to how it is prepared and convenient for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the Incision of a Defect.
Caput XCII.	Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins are found wrapped and large, full of superfluous melancholic substances that occur in many parts of the body; and most frequently they occur in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and labor, and carry things.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary that you administer an incision of the body from black bile several times with a strong incision.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then the phlebotomist should take the patient's blood vessel.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of them with iron, is according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are cut and black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another method is, that the vein be lifted and drawn out entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it is according to this way.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	Swell the leg first with hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the leg of the infirm from the upper part of the hip, to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw blood from the lower part of the leg upward with your hand, and from above it is necessary for the lancet to cut the weak first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the nail until it comes out from the blood as much as you see sufficient, and as much as the strength of the weak can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile. And repeat evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and this harms the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its elevation is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If the leg is weak, and has many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce it into the bath: or embrocate it on his leg with warm water until it reddens, and the veins swell: or exercise him vigorously, if there is no bath present, until the limb heats up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in a direct vein incision lengthwise: or at its end near the knee, or in the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and excise the vein from every part until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, you see it red to blackness sloping.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it comes out of the skin, you see it white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce under it a radium until when it is raised and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make a dry incision near that incision with three fingers' width.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then raise it with Rays as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another dry incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then elevate and make an incision at its last section near the heel bone.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then draw it out to the section which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have removed it from the incision which is higher, or all higher incisions, until when it emerges wholly; then cut into it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If it does not obey you to extract and elevate it, then introduce a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it, and extract it; or introduce a probe under it, and revolve your hand to every part until it emerges.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, lest it be struck.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it will be difficult for you to remove it well, and it will enter into the weak place from it damage.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have extracted it whole: then place upon the place of the wound wool dipped in wine and rose oil, or oil: and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted, having a winding shape whose convolution goes to parts, and is not as we said according to straightness; then it is necessary that you feel upon it on every part of its winding shape, and the places of its convolution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you have lifted the whole thing; and be careful at your incision upon it that you do not cut a vein or wound it, for it will be difficult to lift or extract it above you.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, keep your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Method of Cutting for the Healing of a Grapevine
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of a blind pouch.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	There is no need for it to be as fine as the other needles, nor does it have a sharp point so that it does not wound a vein; and it is of thick flexibility, gentle: because if it were fine, it would wound a vein with its fineness; indeed let its thickness be superfluous, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Vein of the Thigh.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCI.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as those of Alizegi and Arabia, and in dry, hot lands with little tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is indeed from putrefaction that happens under the skin, just as it happens within bodies of snakes and worms ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this Vein's incision is that a fierce inflammation happens in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then it is cauterized.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then begins the vein to exit from the place of that urination, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore the extremity of it appears, then it is necessary that you wrap upon itself a lead piece, whose weight be from one drachma to two drachmas and tie it; and let go the suspended lead from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore anything comes out of it to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged for a long time, then cut part of it, and wrap up the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it root and branch before it has come out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if it cuts, it contracts and enters into flesh; and it causes an abscess to happen, and rot in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently and extracted gradually until it emerges from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein some men emerge which is in length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has come to me, because a man has emerged from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	If you encounter this during your medical treatment: then insert a reed into its hole and pierce it with a long hole together with the body until all that is within it of matter is evacuated, and administer corruption to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and it happens to have many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, care for it, as we said in the division, and with what was previously stated.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	On the incision over worms generated under the skin, and it is called the illness of a bull.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCI.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This illness is called among us in a certain land "bull's sickness," because it happens very often to oxen, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes through the whole body, ascending and descending; and it is shown to the sense in its movement from limb to limb, until it ruptures wherever it ruptures in the skin, and exits.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the rot of some humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and serpents, that is, roundworms and pinworms, happen in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when he enters the body and is raised to the head and comes to the place: then perhaps he opens it and emerges and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to cure him and extract it, then this is done only when he walks about and appears to his senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you must bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong constricting band.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and take it out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it goes deep into the flesh and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire over the spot until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater thing to be feared is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If you see him having arrived near the eye on the head, then tighten under it a good constriction of the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry him over and remove him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person use the purification of his body, with medicines dissolving the bad, putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On incision for disease according to Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XC.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is pain which occurs in certain limbs: then it changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed have already seen him, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was summoned to a weak woman with some wounds.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he exposed his arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I waited one hour, I saw one inflation moving with a finger, like a worm, ascending to his shoulder faster than it could: like live silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore pain went from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for an hour, and it ran throughout the rest of his body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that he was turning over his whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed at the speed of its transfer from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I indeed before this had not seen this sickness with my eyes in this way according to this manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find pain to change from one limb to another; and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that this is otherwise, because the woman was from those who have veins of dry body tissue exposed; hence, it appears to the sense that lightness has been changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels this pain; then if it appears to your eye, as we have said, then tightly bind above it, and below it quickly: and dry above it until that windiness is expelled constrainedly: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with a scraping of the body and with that which expels winds, and carminates them with foul pills, and pills from serpentaria, and similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their kinds and according to the places in which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is: because among them are those that have large points, and small: and concave, and deaf.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And there are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And from those who have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And from those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are according to two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or else the limbs are from the principal members concave, such as the brain, and the heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and the like.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you which I tell you after, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these signs of evil do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then draw it out, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	When an arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the skull and emerges from the part above the brain, the signs are: because there occurs from it violent frothing, and scotoma, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may issue from the nose, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there comes forth from the place of the wound a white moisture like gruel.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it comes out from there like a watery fleshiness.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple: and he feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the movement of an arrow is similar to the movement of a pulse; and blood runs from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And following this comes coldness of the extremities and cold sweat and fainting spells.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore that death certainly comes.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow wound to the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck suppurate, and the color of the sick man changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales great, high spirit: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow falls into the membrane that is in the chest: then it is near the ribs: and a great gasp with intense pain, with a sigh: and all the members of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something indigested will exit from the wound along with food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow falls into the belly and lodges in it, something of feces comes out from the wound, or a piece of intestine which is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope of healing it, nor of extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow falls into the bladder and urine flows out, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the patient: then you shall know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and spatula, and auxiliary tool, and dorsal vertebrae, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and things similar to these members are healed according to various arrangements: when it does not find the artery, or nerve: and is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may understand through this about your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is because to a certain man an arrow fell into the lacrimal gland of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not extract it except for its small extremity, with which it adheres to its shaft: and the arrow was large of the arrows of the Turkish bows, with gentle iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And there was an Arabian arrow, and it is that which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore followed it between two guides; and now it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I worked skillfully with it until I extracted it: and Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I removed another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut along the shaft of the arrow: and I fashioned it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom an arrow fell on his back, and the wound had become solid over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years, a shaft emerged from the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound was consolidated over her, and the arrow remained inside her: and nothing was changed from her dispositions, and the woman did not find harm to her in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, to whom an arrow fell upon his face: and the wound was consolidated, and remained, not finding much pain in him: and similar things like these many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already declined to the right side a little: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore I was called to his cure after the arrow wound for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore found a wound from an arrow quite constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore I examined it with a fine probe and did not feel it; and he himself was finding a prickling and pain under his ear on the right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore I supposed that the prick was from the point of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore I placed a plaster on the spot with a plaster which had the power of attraction and digestion, trusting that the place would fester and that a sign like an arrow would appear to me so that I could cut above it: but nothing happened in the spot that indicated that the arrow had followed the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore I diligently applied a poultice to it for many days; and no accident occurred, and the wound was consolidated in the meantime; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore I placed on the wound medicine acute and corrosive for many days until it opened; and when I probed it and felt the subtle point of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that acute medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to us; and about four months elapsed with him in that time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not obey to exit: then I did not cease to be subtle, and to devise over it with modes of ingenuity, until I began upon a certain day with forceps made properly, according to what will come in the form of them at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm person was healed in perfect health: and nothing harmed him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that rule and meaning over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not grasped with the narration; nor does it encompass that book, and a wise craftsman compares little to much; and what is present to what is absent; and finds a new operation, and a new instrument among the descents of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that arrows do not come out of limbs in which they are fixed, except according to two modes.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either by drawing it out from where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or on the contrary, the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in fleshy place: and it is drawn out, and it comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to removal by the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you dismiss it for several days, until the flesh that is around it rots: and the attraction of it is relieved, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it becomes lodged in the bone, and does not obey you to come out, then leave it also for several days: and repeat it with traction and movement every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you to the end after days, then you ought to pierce it around the arrow shaft in the bone itself from every part with a fine awl until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already progressed into one part of the brain's ventricle, and some of those accidents which I have said appear from the sick man, then abstain from drawing out the arrow, and let it go, until it may be equal to be removed after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if an arrow reaches the lung, then death does not delay for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, only in the bone, and does not penetrate to the fascia, and remains weak for several days, and nothing happens to him from those accidents; then the ingenuity is in drawing out the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is firmly fixed and does not obey you when you try to pull it out: then administer a trepanation around the arrowhead, as I have told you before. Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If now the arrow is hidden in the place of the body and is concealed and hidden from sense, then seek it out with your touch.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its removal.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot, however, because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then find upon it, until the wound becomes enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If he has ears that are held fast, then free the flesh fixed in them from every part, with all your skill as you can, and the skills, if it is not possible above the evasion of flesh in a fracture of the ears, and their twisting, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of a arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you cause it to emerge: and with the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and it be difficult for you its attraction, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it within one hour, then leave it for several days until what is around it has decayed.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the process: for if blood flow is loosened, and if it opposes you, then administer what we said from the cure in its chapter: and keep your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer the skill in every way you can of the evacuation of the arrow, and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, just as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that you do when drawing an arrow, that it be weak according to the figure, according to how it was with the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow which comes out from the opposite part of another, or has already come out from it to the exterior; or makes a swelling at the extremity of the arrow by feeling from the upper part of the skin close by, and you see it protruding: therefore dry it carefully on it, and let the section be according to the quantity which they grasp in it with forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out; for indeed it becomes easy to be drawn out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow imprints itself in the bone and amplifies itself; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let her be left for a few days; then repeat it until she comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If a piece of wood from an arrow is in it, then drive that out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If a stick has fallen and you wish to administer an impulse: then introduce an instrument with a concave shape into it so that the cavity of the instrument enters the tail of the arrow, then drive it in with the same force.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrow is concave, then drive it in with an instrument going into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is lifted up by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh in which the poison is: if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it as is fitting for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is falling into the chest, or belly, or bladder, or side: and it is near because you touch it with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of incision of vein, or nerve, and draw it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound if you see it, and care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be like the beak of a bird, which have been made like iron: when they grasp a shaft, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds are made from these, large and small and medium, according to the quantity of the magnitude of the arrow, and its smallness, and the wideness of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Shape of the Concave Impelling Tool.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the Impeller for the deaf.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is for the deaf extremity like the radius, so that its entrance may be relieved into a concave arrow and it may be driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this instrument is concave like a bird's feather so that the entrance of the arrow into it and its impulse may be eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On the incision of veins.

Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, a lancet should not be sharp at the extremity, like other lancets, but rather blunt at the extremity.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And let the lancet be passed across it because the bone is near, and perhaps the lancet will break when it is fine.

Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	On phlebotomy. The vein under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the usefulness of phlebotomy is this: that cephalic phlebotomy is good for affections which are in the throat, and pains of the gums, and pains of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The veins which are let in the elbow, there are three of which the cutting has custom in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bloodletting of these is done according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad myrtle knife blade: or olive-wood to the fineness of a slope: or cutting with a surgical knife and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Al-Zahrawi is, that which is convenient for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And among these are broad and subtle kinds, according to the width of the veins and their strictness.  The form of the phlebotomy knife should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is proper to open the hollow veins, full, coming forth, appearing, thick, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of less width and more delicate point.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is fitting for bloodletting of the veins that contain fine, yellow-tinged blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	On bloodletting at Basilicas.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The basilica vein of these three is helpful for bloodletting.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from ailments that are in the throat and neck, because it follows the chest and abdomen: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to take care with the phlebotomy, so that he may beware and be above fear from it, because under it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds in incision of the vein, he incites that artery, and there occurs a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary that she be bled not with a sharp lancet: but rather with a cutting one like Alnesil's.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilica does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is necessary that one takes another basilica, and change it to another, or seek some branch of it; or in place of the phlebotome, a rope of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is manifest, and dry it with a lancet named Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same person, then before the stricture of the arm, you must touch the place until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then signs over the place with a cauterizer, then the arm, and the vein dry cut with a concave incision with the phlebotome Alnesil, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And take care lest the blow fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, an inflation in the place which you marked with wax, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rising during bloodletting like a boy's urine, and it is fine-grained, red; then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore hasten, and place your finger upon it, long space, then take away your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut (for many times indeed it is cut), then bind the arm, and release it; and let the sick person guard against movement of it; and let him be over fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let it not be moved for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If blood does not cease flowing and overcomes you, and there is no medicine present to you at the moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities are contracted, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of ficus and soften it: take half of it and bind it over the place of the vein constriction with a bandage and cotton wool until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not so: then treat the one with it whose preceding remembrance from the place of powder cutting flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a ligament from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On the bleeding of the vein called Fusca.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The veins of the Fusca are helpful for phlebotomy, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower part of the body, because it is composed of the Basilica branch and the Cephalic branch, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that he be above fear from his phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds in the puncture of phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, it happens in that numbness occurs, and healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve appears often to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	If it is hidden in some people, and it is subtle, and does not appear: then you must place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize, a section with Alnesil, and sever the nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful because it draws blood from the head and brings relief to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you prick it with a lancet, either with an olive-tree lancet, or with a myrtle-tree lancet; because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the lancet the head of the lacerti, and seek a gentler place: and it does not harm him, if when first struck, it is not found, that it be repeated upon it several times with phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Nevertheless, perhaps a boil will develop in some men when it is not lanced in the first percussion, but it does not harm him in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents from it, in which you ought to think about rectification.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Therefore, first of all, it is important for you to know that bloodletting is not administered unless for the preservation of health and its perseverance, and caution against the advent of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that a phlebotomy be made in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely Cephalic, and Dark, and Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that venesection should be performed at the beginning of Spring on a fast, in summer, and in autumn and winter after a meal, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	Let a bloodletting be performed on the first or third day, after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Venesection, which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when convenience and necessity call for it, at night, or day, and in every hour, and in every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not right that boys should be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	A pregnant woman shall not be bled, unless from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	The elderly who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wants to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that he purify his intestines before bleeding with a gentle enema, if in them there is much feces retained: so that the veins at the time of bleeding do not attract impurities from the intestines harmful to the main limbs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is vomiting be bled, that is, full of nausea; nor one who is drunk, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until it has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor one with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic passion, and vomiting, and flux of the belly, and multiplication of intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and all that dissolves the strength from the physical or animal thing.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for it.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he enters the bath, if nothing prevents him; or he is exercised with some exercise, so that the blood may be refined.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the phlebotomy in his chest, around the third day, as we said; and try so that his chest be evacuated on that day from all accidents of evil animals: such as tightness, and anger, and fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and punishment, and superfluity, and those similar.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make present to his seat things whose use men have acquired from fragrance, and scent, and joy and the like, to the extent of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit upon a stool, that it be higher than the phlebotomist's stool; afterwards he shall withdraw his arm, and rub himself with his hand twice, or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he tightens the ligament with corrections and wraps it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, because when a constriction is unequal, either through excess in the constriction, then it prevents the course of blood; or in softening, then it also prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after constriction it is necessary that the surgeon rub his hands simultaneously and again until the veins swell and become apparent to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the surgeon cut the vein with a little oil, as was formerly done.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he puts his index finger of the left hand upon the vein in the place where he wants to perform a phlebotomy, little: so that the vein does not flee, and the percussion is missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because from veins there is one which you find as a fleeing cord in the vein-letting operation; and from them is that which is full of windiness; and when you put the vein-letter on it, it contracts under the vein-letter, and the vein-letterer is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is strict. Therefore it is necessary that the vein-letterer be firm, and be solicitous in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he puts down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore a vein is opened from one source, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that with another incision under it in a small place, or above it with haste: if the place does not suppurate.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it becomes suppurating or the patient weakens, then dismiss him on that day or two days after, and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	He shall not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him return to phlebotomy, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or blood flows subtly: and you fear that the quantity of blood which you desire may not exit; then repeat the incision of the vein in the very foramen according to straightness, and add little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste, before the place becomes suppurated, for a suppurating place is in many people at a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see the abscess already, then do not return on it at all, for it excuses nothing to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place upon it something of the feces of oil; because it will alleviate the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than the rest of olive.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the feces of oil in all your bloodletting, where you bleed veins at the prohibition of blood flow, and they make it with tyriaca alfarach, and sagzenea, when one of them is placed over the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood, when it is thick, becomes refined and resolved.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess occurs at the site of bloodletting, which often happens, especially to those who are not bled unless absolutely necessary, or have a small vein opened, then hasten and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated for a short time: and bind it for an hour; because it will be dissolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out of the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something remains in place after days, some black or greenish, it does not harm: and if you wish, put on top of it something of aloe, or myrrh solution: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamine or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And often indeed abscesses and swellings occur at basilica bloodletting.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore place your hand upon it, then if you find softness at your compression upon it, then that eminence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, beware that you place something upon it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of an artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for him with that in which there is stypticity, that the place may be covered.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from every man from his blood according to the amount of his virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color winning over blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	If the blood is black, then let it flow out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow out until it becomes thinner; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting with one vein only, that the incision be made wide and broad, and for the weak person, let the opposite be done.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it in incisions, and that the opening be narrow: and better which is administered in phlebotomy of the vein is, that a transverse section be made, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to come among the bloodletters with fainting, let it be that food before phlebotomy is given moderately with bread infused in pomegranate juice: or boiled rice, if it is heated: and draw out of his blood in three or four times.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if it is of a cold constitution, then let him take before the bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of myrrh, or in syrup of honey flavored with spices, or in aromatic and fragrant syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope should occur during phlebotomy, and the cause is the exit of much blood, then it is necessary that he take a drink of water with flesh, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with algae, and liniment his chest with it; and use the rest which we said in the division in the chapter on syncopes from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But whoever wants to let blood from his arm, and release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is because of much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he should release the blood gradually by the amount of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	He who wants to let blood from his arm, and loosen his blood the second time, and his body is strong; then he should do it after seven or nine hours from his first incision.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In the body of which there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and it causes fever to occur: it is necessary that the blood go out from it in one vein, and a large quantity be extracted from it: and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs: after you have been conserving all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you put your hand over his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Many times indeed it happens that the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not right when you wish to loosen the arm and loosen the blood a second time, since the orifice of the vein has already been closed and difficult exit of blood is made, that one should press upon it violently and quickly stretch the cut.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a very bad evil, indeed let it alone until it is bled second.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Either remove with the sharpness of a lancet that which is clotted from the blood at the opening of the vein, and place something salt dissolved in water above it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something of alfarach ointment, or sazzena, and place it with a gentle compression until the blood departs.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If a vein has already been affected by an abscess, then let it go and do not hold it until the abscess sits.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity compels blood to be let for a second time and there is no excuse, then either the phlebotomist should make the incision above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The cord of the arm is cut by the vein where the Fuscous and Basilica are located, when these veins are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of bloodletting is that the sick person should put his hand into hot water until the vein becomes visible and prominent.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is bound over itself with a bandage with slight constriction in the middle.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then make the incision with the lancet second to the transverse direction, gradually and not laterally or lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your incision be such that it cuts across the joint of the hand for a short distance.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the exit of blood is prevented, then repeat your hand in warm water, and let the blood flow in the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And most especially the flow of blood is put in hot water in wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And vein incision of this vein is safer than all veins, because under this vein there is neither pulsating nor nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	A bloodletting on the right hand of Salvatella is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that you should tie the vein with a bandage or your hand after you have put it in warm water until the vein swells and becomes apparent to the touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the surgeon cuts it transversely with a lancet.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care, lest you last use your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it are the nerves of the fingers laid bare of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then apply your hand to the hot water, and let the blood run into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not run it in hot water, blood clots at the opening of the vein and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have extracted from the blood the quantity of necessity, then place over the vein oil and salt, that it not solidify quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly you must do with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	Now the incision for phlebotomy from the left hand is this: because it is helpful against spleen diseases: and do similarly in phlebotomy of it, as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of cutting the saphenous vein is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as pains in the womb, and retention of menstruation, and infirmities of the kidneys, and ulcers of the hips and legs, old ones, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person shall put his foot into hot water and make friction upon it until the veins swell up, and bind above the joint of the foot with a ligature.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the veins are indeed located near the heel bone, appearing towards the thumb: and they branch out from it on the face of the foot into many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, let the phlebotomist make the incision in the larger branch of it, or near the heel in its collection: because it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If he opens a vein on the face of the foot, then be cautious of the nerves which are below it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your incision for phlebotomy as if you want to cut it transversely, and let the lancet be named Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If the exit of blood is prevented, then immerse his foot again in hot water; and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then he should return with phlebotomy to the upper region for a short time, for that place is safe, and you should not fear evil from it, when you are careful of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the calcaneum from the left side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the remedy for this incision is to the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that he who is sick should enter the bath and hasten; and wrap his leg from the side of the buttock to above the heel four fingers' width with a slender long bandage: for it does not appear unless for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then the phlebotomist shall open it according to whichever art is possible to you, or according to the transverse cutting. And it is better, either that you cut it with an incision, or separate it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	The place of it is safer, and it itself is hidden in many people's bodies.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the sense, then let a phlebotomist take some branch of it, and it is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and make it run from the blood as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the constriction, and place leather over the site of the incision, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals quickly indeed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Wind Evacuation and its Use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Surgical instruments are made from horn, and from bronze, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventosaion is indeed done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With incision and bloodletting: and another is ventosaion without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this type of cupping which is without incision is according to two modes.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or else it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And there are fourteen places in the body that receive treatment with scarification and bloodletting.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	There is one called Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and  Ventosatio Alhagdahim, and these are two plates of the neck from two parts together: and Ventosatio menti, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth: and Ventosatio duarum spatularum: and Ventosatio Alachosos over the end of the tail: and Ventosatio duorum focilium, and these are in the middle of the two arms: and Ventosatio duorum crurium: and Ventosatio duarum cauillarum.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping does not draw blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for that reason there is no loss of strength from them, as there is in the case of phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not proper to administer cauterization, whether with fire or without fire, in any ailment that arises from fullness, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity compels us to bloodletting from sickness or out of habit, we administer it at any hour, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at any time whatsoever.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because among men there are those who when blood multiplies in them until it needs to be extracted through venesection, find heaviness and pain in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And of these there is one who has found a fullness and redness in his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And of these there is one who found itching on his face and forehead, and darkness, and dimness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among these is one who sharpens the place of his ventilation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And of these there is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And of these is he who finds a taste of blood in his mouth; or the tongue becomes inflamed and discharges blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there are those who see in their dream blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of these things, and properly if it is on the third day of the month: we prescribe then for ventilation to be done, after two hours or three have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	A wound of the neck, namely, because it contributes to gravity in the head and that which flows out towards the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that it should be after evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this certain one is called Ventosa in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use it by someone who has a cold constitution, or one who has a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it inflicts great harm upon him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore it is not necessary that they should use these things (the elderly), and those who have cold pains in their heads.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	He who is diligent over it, forgets it upon himself.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason, it is necessary that you instruct the Operator to place his hand with a somewhat wind-carrying instrument below, fearing the production of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation or Alkehel is in the place of phlebotomy Fuscae and phlebotomy Basilicae, and because of this it brings on asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the instrument, and coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the pessary be driven by a gentle wind, because if it is put below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Bloodletting in the head relieves pains due to accidents, ophthalmia, migraine, and perforation, and pain in tooth roots; it is in place of bloodletting in the basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Wind-drawer not to press his hand with the cutting so that he does not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Bloodletting under the chin is helpful for ulcers in the mouth and for similar ailments that are in the mouth; it takes the place of other types of bloodletting which are on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	The application of a spoon, however, contributes to the softening, which is made by rubbing and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Bloodletting of the internal parts with two leeches aids phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilicae, Fuscae, and Cephalicae: for it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three major veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the Wind-sucker, so that he does not proceed too much in the cutting; for the place is laid bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The suction cup, when applied to the affected areas, relieves hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-catcher to be large and made of metal; because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps thin wind-catchers break. And let it be scarified with a large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Bloodletting of the legs diminishes by obvious manifestation because it draws blood from the whole body and brings relief to old pains in the kidneys, wombs, and bladder; it causes menstruation and alleviates fever and dyspnea; and stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and  the external jugular vein.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Nevertheless, they greatly weaken the body and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the treatment of wounds in the arm is similar to the treatment of wounds in two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the syringes is that you put the syringe in first empty, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the syringes, but put them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place with equal arrival; and do not cease to repeat this and continue it until you see the place already red and swollen, and the redness of blood appears; then therefore scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the arrangement of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For one who is of tender flesh and few pores, it is necessary that he be scarified once, not more; so that the place may not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And tell the Ventor (suction apparatus), to increase the depth of incision and make it shallow; and moderate the suction in ease, speed, and its own motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first opening, the way is opened for the refinement of blood and its liquidity; and in the second, for the examination of the exquisite extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If, however, the blood is foul, then let a third type of scarification be made so that it may follow to its end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And lastly, when we want to draw blood gradually, or a little, one incision is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to make many incisions for bloodletting, we make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep incision, and the equal term in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What that thing is which ought to be administered from oils at the positioning of  Winds and what the Wind-setter should beware.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case, if the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are narrow, it should be anointed with ointments of Ventosare, using open, soothing, and dissolving oils: If it is in summer time, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or almond oil, or oil from pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in wintertime, then oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or syrup: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the superfluity is gross and cold, then use bitter oil, or oil of balsamita, or alba oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If a wide and porous wound needs to be treated, of tender flesh: then it is necessary that it be prohibited from oil, and it is necessary that these places be washed after the cleansing with rose water, or with cold water, or with water of saltwort, or with gourd water, or with purslane water: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of much moisture, shall wash wounds with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumagh, and the like.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Those whose superfluities are coarse, he should wash their windy parts with old wine, or with water of Samsocia, or with a decoction of fennel, or chamomile: and the like.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that ventilation be avoided in the bath, or in the place of the bath, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after exiting the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for someone to sleep after an incision.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is that which must be regulated, a Vento-sandus or a Phlebo-matus before venesection?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, it is necessary to consider first: then if it is windy or phlebotomized, and the heat and inflammation dominate over his blood: then it is necessary for him to receive cooling things, such as pomegranate syrup, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and scanabine, and iuleb, and similar ones.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food chicks, and meats of sheep cooked, and foods prepared with herbs: and similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if its complexion is cold, it ought to take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let it take medium scented wine, which is between old and new: and let it be prescribed that it use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put food for him chickens, and sparrows: and small birds: and young pigeons he should give.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drinking on the day of venesection and phlebotomy be more than food; and it is necessary that in some men in the hours before venesection, tyriaca alfaroch be given in drink, or medicine of musk, that is, muscatel, or alesselithe before venesection: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal limbs may be comforted, and the blood made finer.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it ought not that they take it in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On Varicose Veins Without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	There are also incisions that are made without incision, namely those that are placed on the liver, and spleen, and foot, and on the abdomen, navel, and places of the kidneys, and the hip joint: because these members do not tolerate incision upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not sought by means of these, unless it be either a touch from one limb to another, as we place a leech on the nipples in the grief of blood flow in the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to loosen coldness from the invisible wind in a limb; such as placing a pessary over the abdomen and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it indeed thins the limb and warms it, and removes pain because it dissolves that inflammation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when there is a swelling or stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	By virtue of its force perhaps it opens a wound, or removes a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it is done when placed over the flank and the spleen must be treated with poultices on both of these.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these suctions are administered with a cupping only when there is a cutting.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes full warm water is administered in ailments of pleurisy: and this is done so that the suction cup be filled, and be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that are suitable have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of a cupping glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two fingers wide, according to what we have formed: and let its quantity in depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side, in the place which is about the middle of it, according to the size that enters the needle into it:  let it be made of copper or brass, of coarse margin, soft, equal, third: so that it does not injure the limb when it is placed upon it: and let there be a transverse rod in its middle, of copper or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this is made much larger, greater than we have narrated, and somewhat smaller than that, according to the ailments and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For children and thin people there are different types of cupping instruments than those used for men and stout bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this windy [treatment] with fire on the limb is, to light a splint with fire from linen properly, or a small candle from wax: and place it over the middle of the transverse rod that is in the middle of the windy [treatment]: so that the fire be burning around the lower part of the windy [treatment], so that the body of the sick person does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then a finger is placed over the limb and over the opening which I have said, until when we hold the windpipe; while we need, we remove the finger, and vapor will go out through that opening, and the windpipe will be released immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then fire licorice according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In a cupping glass which is administered in the ailment of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not administered, unless it is filled with water, and placed over the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this suction cup, the more it is large, so that it takes much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	On the suspension of blood-letting vessels.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not administered in many places, unless in those limbs where the position of vents is not possible because of their small size, such as the lip and gums, and similar ones.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a bare limb, such as a finger, and nose, and things similar to these.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you take from bloodsuckers which are in fresh waters, clean from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they shall be placed day and night in fresh water until they are famished, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body shall be evacuated first with phlebotomy, and with ventosa.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the limb of the infirm, until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they are to be placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and they fall, and it is possible suction of the place with winds, then it is more final in help: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, it shall be rubbed and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood after the removal of the bloodletting is prolonged and there is a weeping, then place a linen cloth soaked in cold water on top until the weeping stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood multiplies, then powder over it finely crushed zegi or gallic, and similar to them from styptics: until the blood is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or let pads of peeled beans be placed over the area and left until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if a repetition of bloodletting is needed, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If leeches are forbidden from suspension, then the place shall be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or place a point there until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are to be placed, for when they feel something from blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish that they may fall, pulverize upon them something of pounded aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of Surgery of Albucasis Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and cure of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of a fracture and dislocation accidents in the bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that the foolish physicians and the common people boast about this Chapter, and those who have never looked at the ancient book nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this cause it comes about that this method is deprived of sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never found anything good in it whatsoever, and I have not attained from it what I have attained except because of the length of reading ancient books, and study over their understanding, until I extracted knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Thereafter by experience and study throughout the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you in this Chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and above what has passed my experiment, after I have shortened it for you, and delivered it from the occupation of elongation, and shortened it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declination: and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, as it is by addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Therefore, and collections from the kind of bone fractures, of those whose introduction is necessary before we begin the recollection of broken limbs, and diverse, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue to this Chapter, that we set forth the main points and sections, to the understanding of which the artisan first needs to attend to their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him and release him, or both at once: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength: or he is one who has happened something of these things, a child, or an old man decrepit: or the time is vehement heat, or vehement cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	He should be satisfied with his food, with cold herbs and the flesh of birds and hares: and he should forbid wine and coarse meats, and from being filled with foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from the hot abscess, and fear not the outflow of matter to the limb: then let the sick return to his first way of living with which he has custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore a fractured bone begins to be restored, it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, much, thick, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of oxen, and eggs, and fresh fish; and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen, clotting of a fracture is made more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones when they are in men who are in the first old age, and decrepit, it is not possible, that they may be continued and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the drying up of their limbs; and they consolidate and continue which are from them at the end of softness, like the bones of little children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature joins together over a broken bone something like glue, which has thickness, so that it adheres and binds it, until they are conjoined edge to edge, and bound edge to edge, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, just as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you put food for the sick, in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs; because a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all the other limbs exist diversely one from another: and I have come with the remembrance of every kind of fracture exposed in its own Chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of bone fractures also vary within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it is shaped like a bow, besides which stars occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes a fracture of it occurs according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of it stars, that is, star-shaped, and additions proceeding, such as are in a reed, when it is fitted with a knife to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and it is a fracture with wound and rupture in the head: and it is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each kind has its own skill or instrument for its restoration, according to what is remembered of it, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And by that which is known as a fracture of a bone, it is its crookedness, and its prominence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor a sound at your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the sick person find great pain: then there is no fracture there, indeed it is possible that there is twisting, or a small fissure: therefore you ought not to move it with your hand and compression at all, rather put upon it from medicines, of which recollection comes, after the time which is fitting in place: then the constriction should be tightened finely.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is bent and split into two, besides which wounds happen in it, nevertheless all parts are removed from their counterpart: then you must begin from your hour to its rectification, equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however a hot abscess happens to him, then dismiss it for several days until the abscess has quieted.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equal it according to whatever way he can by gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its balancing are easier than bones, in which there occur many breaks.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it, according to what will come to your remembrance of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If there are splinters in the bone, then extension of this limb is necessary from two parts, if it is a hand or a foot: or with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that when you place the limb upon an equal place, according to its natural form, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then try, so that you may return those additions with all your ingenuity, and according to any way you can in their places: and beware, according to your strength, that it does not happen that super infirmum during your operation there is pain, nor injury: and try, according to your strength, so that you apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to the better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary in that hour, that you test and touch him with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, rectify it, and make it equal by the quantity of your virtue.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent stretching and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often they make happen by that their operation an abscess hot, or a contraction in the limb: as we have already seen it from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then bind after the equalization, and a decent operation, and the stricture of that limb, and rest, and tranquility: and warn the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And let him keep himself from moving, lest he move himself in the hour of his vigils, and his sleep at his turning, and his agitation, and at his defecation, and all his movements with his last strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he may guard against it, so that there be not a position of the limb with which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb: then it is necessary that he change it to another position from that in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with it, that its position is equal and straight: so that there does not happen distortion in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of the fractured limb is, according to what I narrate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, for those which are small, such as the arm, and finger, and foot, and similar things, then it ought to be a soft, fine cloth wrapping.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those which are gross, such as the hip and leg, ought to have a wide, hard bandage on them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the large limb and tightens it from every side with an equal constriction, so that no blemish enters into it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable ointment to the equation, on soft padding over the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligament over the place of the fracture of itself with three or four wrappings, according to what the limb deserves: and tighten your hand a little with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part from the fracture site, and tighten less than was your constriction where you constricted the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then lengthen yourself with the rolling from the place of the fracture a little, and soften the constriction gradually until you grasp from a healthy place a large thing.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip and wrap it again over the broken place with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then go with the wrapping down to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in contraction of the stricture and softening it, according to what we said in the first prior evolution.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the bandages soft cotton, or cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is matched, if there is twisting in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then bandage over the same wound another.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, equal bandages are laid over these folds and stars made in a central manner, immediately, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a warm abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If, however, there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place on it what sits above that abscess and remove the swelling; and let it be for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten over the very star.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the Astellae be from the middles of a broad cane, scraped, and wisely shaped; or let them be from wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi: and let the size of every Astellae be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the stellate that is placed over the very wound should be somewhat thicker and wider than the rest of the stellar bodies; and the length of the stellate should be according to what is permitted by the member from its magnitude and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten over the Astellas with another witta, according to the first stricture of the same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind above with threads properly, according to what we said about constriction: and let it be that your constriction is above the place of fracture more; and the more it is elongated from the fracture, the less the constriction.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and fineness, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operation of fools who put their threads from twisted hemp cords, it is a great error; because the stricture falls with them outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very fine threads are not suitable again; because you do not achieve with them through the stricture what you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it ought not to be less than a finger's width between the stars.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If a sick person is wounded by the ends of the stars after stricture in healthy places, then place under them soft wool or carmine-dyed wool until nothing hurts from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with a wound and rupture occurs in the skin, I will come to it in the second chapter with its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every broken limb ought to be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because when a limb is large, it is not necessary to place stars on top of it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of a hot boil.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of plasters which the ancients used to restore, which are put upon a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A method of a common plaster for shortening a fracture, suitable for many constitutions, especially women and children; because it is from that which does not overcome heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is, as you receive from the mill dust, and there is a pulp of flour which hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and you make it like this, except that you sift it with the membrane of an egg: and place its preparation not thick, nor fine.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	A method of poultice, another for restoring fractures, dislocations, and torsions.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take of frankincense, and laurel, and acacia, and euphrasia, and myrrh, and the juice of all ana ʒ X.  Myrrh, and aloes both ana ʒ V, and alethil ʒ XX are ground together, and sifted, and mixed with alethil water; or with egg white if the patient's condition is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	A mode of plaster, which also benefits fractures and torsions.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take ground cinnamon, and white alum, of each ten grains; myrrh, and aloes of each five grains; acacia six grains; twenty grains of Armenian bole. Grind all together with much friction, sift them, and make them into a paste with water or egg white: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it soothes pain that happens to them, and the breaking of bones, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool fleece and submerge it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it over the site.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good in the sedation of a hot abscess: and it drives out pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A Method for a Plaster that Restores a Broken Bone
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig and leaves of wild poppy; and grind them all together, and make a poultice from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of a shortened poultice, administered at the restoration of a broken bone: and when you wish for the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of althea, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, all one part each: grind everything together, and make it into a poultice with wine, if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is heated, then mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another way of making a stronger poultice for dissolving, this first one, when a hard abscess occurs at the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take root of althea, and linseed, and marshmallow, and comfrey, and St. John's wort, and violet flower, and chamomile, all one part each, grind everything together and make it with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of it according to the heat of the limb, and the rest of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that something should be placed over a broken limb during its restoration, except for a dressing made from wax and oil; nothing else; and he recounted it as being of medium between thickness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	It seemed to Galen that when restoring a broken limb, things should be placed upon it which have the drying of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar things to those which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of a poultice which helps with wounds and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take chickpea flour and hairs cut from a human or feathers of a bird, althea root, and salt in equal parts: pound them, sift them, and mix them together; and make a plaster from this.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, however, as is necessary, that the bandage should remain, then it should be loosened, namely to consider then, if there does not happen pain to the infirm, nor itching, nor is the broken bone moved from its place: then do not loosen it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it should happen that there is intense itching, or a troublesome pain, or swelling in the place: then hasten and unbind it at once, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, damp: and submerge it in lukewarm water, and bathe the place with it until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on top of it wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and tie over it at night one time until you are sure about the hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb rests, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply it again to the stricture, small and a little plaster; and do not tighten it with your first constriction, but more subtly with it until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all accidents have been completely removed, and it is no longer inflamed with plaster and constriction, then treat it again as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of those things we said happens to a limb, then you do not loosen it, unless after three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is released after twenty days, the whole thing, according to what appears to you from the solution of the limb, as we said, until when the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of flesh approximates over it: add also then in the stricture more than your first stricture total: and add also in the increase of food of the infirm, according to what preceded remembrance of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see that the place of the fracture has already dried up, and become too extended: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore insert it with lukewarm water at every interval where you have loosened it, and let it be in all three days, and alleviate the stricture a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore, through this operation, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	That which foolish restorers do from a fracture of a limb vice another, when it is not restored in the first place, according to what is proper, and is restored according to crookedness, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were straight, they would have said this, in ancient books of theirs, and operated upon it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see anywhere among them a trace of it, and it is better that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	On the making of an injury in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	There are diverse kinds of fractures, and many forms of them; and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture which is made by a blow with a sword: and the blow takes away bone as far as it reaches to the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood: and because of this, this kind of fracture is named Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or if a sword cuts something of the bone and cuts its surface, but the incision does not penetrate to its end: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, absolute luxation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And from a fracture is [a case] of crushing or attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or things similar to these.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the fleshy layer, which is under the bone; or it is on the face of the bone; and is a wound of these two fractures also either small, or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from a fracture it is, which is hidden in the bone in the fineness of hair: and there is a small fissure, and because of this this kind of fracture is called Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And among these is a fracture which is made by chance, or by the blow of a stone, and things similar to it, which make the lamina of bone go into the interior, and a concavity is made: just as happens to cauldrons of air when they are struck, and a part of them goes into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this is very much done in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And with all these kinds of fractures the scag are separated, and I will come with remembrance of the whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by examination on them, and inquiry into them with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh which is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The capillary type is recognized by this, that it is revealed on the bone, and removed, and lined above it with encaustic; for a fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms that they signify an evident indication of danger, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of intellect, and cessation of voice, and syncopes, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of them, and similar symptoms in many arrangements, without a doubt he is not cured: and if you see non-earthly symptoms and hope for salvation, then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a wounded person comes to you first when he is wounded: and it is on the days of winter, then it is necessary that you study the removal of bone before the fifteenth day according to all arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then you ought to hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the flesh decays, and those accidents which we have narrated happen.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If a fracture of the bone has already reached the panniulum touching the brain, and is with small pieces, and friction: then it is necessary that you cut the broken part, and rubbed, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, as you cut the head of the wound: and cover over the bone according to whichever way possible is to you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is light above the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you when you are examining a bone, that there is a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until pus has settled, and you are secure from blood flow.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the cure of bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	There is one way to cut the jaw with a sharp, straight incision tool: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then administer another incision after the incisions, wider than a little bit, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then administer also another incision wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second way is that you have a number of different scalpels, some wider than others and some shorter than others. They should be sharp at their ends and made of iron or steel. And use ease in striking the scalpel so that it does not strike the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If, however, the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary that you pierce around it, before you administer the cutting instrument, with borers which are called terebras, not penetrating deeply; and they are not called so unless because they themselves do not pass through the limit of bone to flesh to that which is after it; for the borer has a rounded extremity above that which is under its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents submerging and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these trebels a large number, each one corresponding in quantity to the thickness of the bone, until you have for the whole skull a trebel; whose pointed extremity's quantity in length and shortness shall be according to the quantity of the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of Trepans, or Trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of piercing in the circumference of a broken bone is: that you place the terebinth upon the bone, and revolve it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then move the terebinth to another place, and put it where there is a hole of the thickness of a radius or about that size.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors where there is a hole in the bone, and make it more delicately than you can above it from the end of the instrument, as we said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand, or with some other of certain instruments which you have prepared for that purpose: such as pincers, and subtle forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you take every precaution so that the Trepan or scalpel does not touch anything from the sieve.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have pierced the bone and separated it from the (adjacent) tissue, if it is continuous with it, and have extracted it, it is necessary that you should level off the edge of it which remains in the bone with another similar instrument, a knife-like one.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	Nonetheless, it ought to be thin and subtle more than other scalpels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If anything remains of the small bones and ligatures, then take them with ease, with what you have among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after this with ointments as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of performing an operation is easy, very far from fear: which Galen said, and praised him with great praise: and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first, to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place in which the fracture is more violent and more evident: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed under it the extremity of this lenticular Incisor, whose form is this.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part is smooth and does not strike anything, and the pointed part of it goes into two sides of it lengthwise, as you see, so that the lens-shaped part rests on the shaft, its face incident with a point on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the incision with one part of a small mallet until you have cut through the whole bone with ease, as it turns; and be sure from the cloth that nothing will happen to it which you should fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not a fool among men, and more ignorant of this, nor would he be asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the flesh in some places, he would cut it off with the edge of the lenticular incisor from him, and free it from him with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of a bone does not penetrate to the subcutaneous tissue, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and there remain in it roughness and subtle splinters: then it is necessary that you shave that roughness, and eradicate those splinters with fine razors of which you have prepared a number of various quantities, so that it may be possible for you to administer from them at every convenient place, the more appropriate ones, and straighter ones, according to what the operation leads you to, and the broken bone itself, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your ration, which first of the roots of bone, wider of those razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And you shall not cease doing this according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the more delicate and subtle of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every fissure of any sort, and in the fine fracture, it is necessary that you administer care according to that which leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing that is not concealed over all, to whom in this art is whatever study, and stood upon what we have written, and showed in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If however the subcutaneous tissue is exposed and held back when you remove the bone; then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and submerge it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as easily as you can so that it does not irritate the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer above this wide ligament: and do not bind it unless by the amount that holds the wound only: and release it with this care on one day, or two days, until you are certain about a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it and afterwards administer medicines with which there is superfluous dryness; such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things to these: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which is powdered over the wound as if they were dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer therein all medicine of that property so that it may cleanse and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And care according to your skill, so that the wound be clean in your treatment; and let there not be in it filth of ointment, nor dirt.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Do not allow the pus to collect there at all; for when pus collects above the brain’s fatty layer, it spoils and rots it, and a great evil happens to the sick after this; and this often happens in a head wound, when it is cleaned from the bone, especially when its care is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider this, if accidents happen to the sick which we have said, know that it is undoubtedly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make that blackness; then it is necessary, that you take from honey one part, from rose oil three parts, and linen cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place him upon a couch: afterward take care of him with proper kinds of treatment until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except when its two upper parts are broken together or one of them, because the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but it only suffers attrition, twisting, and similar things.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert a small finger into the nostril opening, and equalize the fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural form; and let this be done skillfully, with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest through your operation upon the infirm one there should come pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be leveled with the end of the radius, where there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts, then make something similar to it, and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh day, or tenth at rest of the hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the Nose a ligature from linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two ligatures if the fracture is in two parts: and let the ligature be of such thickness as to fill the opening of the Nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that they should be poured into lard and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	It does not seem to me, indeed it ought not, that licorice should be poured into the white of an eye, after it has been ground with powdered millet.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then let go of the splint until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes solid.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in the place of the license, after it has been wrapped above it with a soft cloth: and it is made that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and so that the weak one is not hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do a ligature.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens that a nose abscess is hot again while you are operating, apply plasters to the nose with an ointment of wax, or with cotton wool soaked in rose oil, or with a little diachylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to apply a poultice to it with sesame flour and the powder of frankincense made with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft pledget over it, and do not touch the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose are broken in a small fracture, or shattered, then it is necessary that you divide them above and extract them with instruments which are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then suture the incision, and take care of him with what has become flesh, and it is solidified from appropriate plasters to that, or ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs in the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with liniments and administer a lead pipe until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not with a wound: look then if the fracture is only on the outside, and does not break in two, and it is bent inwards: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part, you must introduce your left index finger into the broken bone: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jawbone, then introduce the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the prominence of the fracture inward with ease to the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone centrally, and with it equalize.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary that you administer an extension from both parts, according to straightness, until it is possible for it to be equalized.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If however a shock or rupture happens in the teeth, then bind those of which you hope that they will remain with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a splint upon the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place upon this double cloth, and place upon the cloth a large splint made centrally: or a piece of sole leather equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind him above, according to how the bandage is prepared for you and its application is suitable, until it is not destroyed: and order the sick person to be in peace and quiet: and put his food absorptions gentle.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If you estimate that something is changing in shape in any way, then hasten and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster to it from ground meal, with white of egg, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cauterized tissue; and place upon the plaster a soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached and the bone arrangement is not altered, let it go, so you do not loosen it until it heals; or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often set in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If meanwhile a hot abscess should occur, then administer that which we have said many times for its subsidence, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now the piece is separated from the bone, or from the saw: then you must be more subtle in this, so that you remove those pieces of the saw together with that which it is convenient for you to remove from them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If, however, the opening of the wound is narrow, then widen it with a surgical knife according to the amount of necessity you have.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those satagie and nothing remains of them, then close the wound orifice if it is wide; and if not, place above it from plasters which are suitable for that, and cover it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The clavicle is broken most frequently at its anterior part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it may be broken and separated into two, besides which wounds occur in it; and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, which happen in bone fractures: and it is more difficult to restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or so, which is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it when the fracture is without a wound, is, that you make two assistants be present, so that one of them holds the aid which follows the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make the fracture equal with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary; and let there be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If the swelling extends more, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's sphere a pad of cloth or wool: and let its magnitude be according to the quantity of your need: and extend, and elevate the fork, and constrict the sphere with your hand until the fracture is equal, as it ought.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the clavicle outward because it has reached deep within, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on his neck and place a pad under his shoulder approximately medium in size, and have an assistant press his shoulder downwards until the clavicle bone that is deep raises upwards. Then straighten the fracture and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a foreign object in the collarbone, and it moves: then it is necessary to place your fingers on top of it and extract the foreign object with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in bone, then ingenuity in its incision with one of the Incissors which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the Furcula instrument that saves sifach: and it is an instrument of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is assimilated to a bowl which has no concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need it from the magnitude of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length of it also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two extremities, as you see: and one extremity is broad, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the wound disruption which you saw when you extracted the fragment of bone is wide and you are concerned about a hot abscess: then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and wool according to the amount of the wound's opening.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess occurs, then pour linen soaked in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A stricture of bone when it is without a wound and without a section is, as you place over the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft plug over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its eyelid, if it needs that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himatema, that is, a saw which the Saracens hold, which should be long and wide, its width one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then put a small doubled piece over the cotton and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a star from a fine board, whose width be three fingers, and in length similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with a bandage in place of the sling which falls over the fracture and its location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place a splint over the fracture as it is rolled, and wrap it over his neck, and under his healthy and diseased collarbone: and reduce it to all parts, and as you see that stricture holds the fracture together tightly: and this is what is not hidden from you, and the whole thing so that the star bone above the fractured bone is not moved.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary that you look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	When therefore the ligament is softened and you see the star already removed: then rectify it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sleep of the sick person upon his back, and place under his pillow near his sleep a small piece of wood at night, so that when he rises it will be an aid to him from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, a fracture of the clavicle is raised by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to the neck of him: and do not untie the ligament unless an accident occurs in place from itching, or from a boil, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the dressing if you see its face fit for it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add in stricture, and let it be released until it is restored and clots.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed a fracture of the collarbone is bound and fortified for as long as twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens in certain people in a shorter time than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of a scapula fracture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula is rarely broken, and in a wide place of it; and margins of it are not broken from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore that place is broken from it, and broken in the middle of it, and this is not known except by touch: then according to what the figure of the fracture is, try the preparation of it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it back to its natural form in every way that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place over the site powder from a mill with the white of egg, and a soft plug, and place above it a little piece of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place over it a wide spatula from a board, according to the quantity of the whole spatula, or somewhat larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, there is a cavity under the star in some place of the spatula, then make that cavity equal with soft cotton wool, until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind from above with an alum-soaked cloth long and tightly, with proper constriction and firmness of the star until it is moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever therefore the ligament is softened, bind it, and with an equal splint if it is moved from its place. And let the sick person lie on his sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed a spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you shall be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made from bones whose union is not feared, nor their loosening.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If a fragment of bone proceeds and pierces under the skin, then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we have said about a fracture of the collarbone from the heat of an abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	On the restoration of a broken breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	Sometimes the chest breaks in the middle of itself, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	His extremities indeed are very much broken and shattered by accidents of his.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle breaks, which inclines downwards, and there comes a violent pain to him, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing: and perhaps he vomits blood, and the concavity of the broken bone is declared and not hidden from the sense, restoration of it is that he be laid on his back: and put between the splints of his pelvis.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press the shoulders of him and gather the ribs from two parts or sides with your hands: and subtlety bring it into its equation, according to every way that it is possible and convenient, until it returns to the figure of the bone, as it ought.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a bandage and cotton wool over it, and place above a small splint made of thin willow wood or similar light wood, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then, with a needle thread it together over the broken bone so that it does not move; and go with the thread according to the roundness to the back several times, and tighten it with a decent binding.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ligation at every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if necessity requires its release because of itching, or corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and loosen it, and eradicate the plaster, and rectify what happened with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see it fit to do so, and bandage the stricture until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur unless in the thick places which follow the back, and from their extremities from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them attrition, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense when it is examined with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is done so that the fracture may be equal with the fingers according to the possible mode, until the figure be made equal, as is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint, if it is needed.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inwards: then a severe pain occurs to the sick person, and a puncture, like that which happens to him who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also he has difficulty breathing, and coughing, and vomiting blood much: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And now the ancients have been ingenious in it with many ingenuities: and of these there are some who say, that you should place foods for the sick which generate inflammation and wind, so that the belly may be inflamed, and extended, and driven to push the fracture outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	For we avoid that it not be a cause swift to make a hot abscess, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If this has already happened, then he adds it to that.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a wind be placed over the place, then suck it with force, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Nevertheless, it is feared that it will attract windy superfluities to the place because of the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil; and let small pieces be placed between the ribs until it is filled; so that there may be an equal bandage when you wrap it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person is treated with treatment for pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the weak person is overwhelmed by a strong thing which he cannot bear, and the bone pierces the flesh with a piercing wound, and we fear for the weak: then it is necessary that we cut above the place, and uncover the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place upon them an instrument that preserves the incision, the memory of which preceded: and let us cut the bone with ease, and let us cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with suture; and we will treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If it should happen in the meantime that a hot abscess occurs, then hasten and pour small pellets in rose oil, and place on the site: and let the sick person be cared for with what is proper for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, he is also laid on his side where he sleeps until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebra of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Sometimes a fracture happens in the bones of the neck, and rarely they are worn away: and similarly in the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore it happens to someone, and you wish to know, whether he will be healed or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	If you see his hands already softened, and numbed, and dead: and they cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them: and when you constrict them with your fingers, and prick them with a sharp point, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it is not healing, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves them and feels constriction with his fingers and a prick: then you know that the nape of the bone is safe, and that the sick man will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it happens to the vertebrae of the back similar to that of this one, and you want to know if it will heal or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happened to his hands has happened to them: then when he lies on his back, windiness and involuntary excretion occur: and when he turns over onto his stomach, involuntary excretion occurs: and when he lies on his back, and wants to urinate, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore do not labor in its cure.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If nothing of that sort happens to him, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of this which happens from it is, that you try to sedate the hot abscess: so, that you put upon the Spine rubbed oil rose only: or with wool saturated with sheep’s butter.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place upon the boil itself this [treatment] several times a day until when the hot abscess is calmed: then place over the place one of the comforting, drying plasters and bind over it with a bandage: and order the patient to use quiet and peace.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He must not sleep upon the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens during bone scraping, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary to cut above the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with some ointment until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If however the last bone of the tail is broken and it is the end, then you must insert your thumb of the left hand into the anus, and with the other hand equalize the broken bone as much as possible, and by the second equation.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place upon it, and remove it: and care for the wound with the cure which preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the Anus.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of the Anchor are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless there is a comminution at the extremities of them: and they are torn in length, and incline to the interior: and there occurs feeble pain in the place, and puncture: and the leg which is broken becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is, that you extend your hand over it until you stand over the fracture as to the figure of it.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the extremities of it, then equalize that fracture according to how you prepare it from the equation, until it becomes assimilated to its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is lengthwise, or already inclines toward the interior, then have the sick person lie on his stomach until you prepare the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have placed it properly, place a plaster upon it; then place a splint of wood or skin upon it; and bind tightly with a bandage that you do not fear the changing of the fracture nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And make equal the concavity of them with that which fills it, until it takes hold of it stricture according to equality: and command the sick person, that he should sleep on his back, or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a hot abscess should occur to him, then cease from its extension and restoration until the hot abscess has settled. And place upon it what was previously said, then return to its restoration, and bind it as is proper.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it happens in the bone a splinter occurs, or it is fractured, extract.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of a broken bone with assistance.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	A help is that which is between the elbow and the head spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of these is: to take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligatures are tied at both extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then let it be suspended from an elevated place: and let the sick person sit upon a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he shall place his broken arm upon a piece of wood until it reaches the center of its splint, which is attached to the middle of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy above it, so that it may stretch the instrument downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician sets the fracture with his hands until the fracture returns, as it ought.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another way is, that the sick person be laid upon his shoulder and the hand of him be suspended from the neck of him with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then bid two servants to hold one above the fracture with his hands; and that another hold below it, and let each extend to his own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish it to be a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and let each of the two attendants extend it to their own parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed under the skin and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary to place a ligature over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then set the fracture with ease and without labor, until when the fracture is equal according to what is necessary, and apply it with a good application: then bind it, if an abscess does not occur that is hot.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the constriction until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on top of this a piece of cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess quiets down; then bind it: and the way to bind it is, as if you were placing a plaster over a fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new cloth bandage over the dressing.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he will bring together the arm over his assistant and place his hand open over his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind over the helper arm so that the arm stands in the place of the stars; if nothing prevents you from this, nor is anything changed upon you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something may be altered over you from a broken bone, then use splints: and it is that you place over the fracture itself the splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the stars a stricture which I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, that your constriction be above the place of fracture tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more elongated the fracture is, let the constriction be less.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the situation of stars and constriction, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the limb immediately do this: and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the constriction and stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that it does not happen in the place itching, or swelling, or be prohibited food to reach the limb, because of the arrangement of the superfluity of tightness.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, rectify that whole thing, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If you are over confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not release the ligament, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	Let the patient lie on his back, and his hands on his stomach: and place under him a cushion full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of night or day that the figure of the broken limb is not loosened, nor is the ligament softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore rectify it all with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the sick according to the order we have previously given, so that it be first a subtle food until he begins to close his mouth; then it is necessary to make his food coarser.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	It is customary for a leg support and help to be tied on for forty days; therefore, it should be loosened, and a bath administered, and medicated with ointments that rectify it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If a fracture is foul and rubbed, then you do not loosen the ligaments and splints for up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearms.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of these is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And another is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger arrow breaks, or a small one: and perhaps they both break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore a small upper fracture occurs, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower leg is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are broken at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone which is broken is a little above the ankle joint, then it behooves the physician at its restoration to put on a small extension with ease until it levels itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the bone that is broken is large, then it is necessary that a stronger bandage be placed.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he put the figure of the hand at its restoration, and its extension extended over the pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers above, and let the lower joint be higher than all the fingers, or the rest: and let the weak, sitting square, be above itself, and let the cushion be before it, or in its direct line, in height, so that the weak does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant shall stretch upwards similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician straightens the bone until it returns to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are fragments in a bone fracture, then try to return every fragment to its place with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If however it appears that the separated wound is piercing the skin, and you have no hope of restoration of it: then cut over it, and remove it according to the manner which we have said in those things which precede.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, so take its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If it happens at the beginning of your restoration that there is a hot abscess, then take a linen cloth with a cauterized made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a fine bandaging, until when the abscess subsides: then remove the cauterization, and put a prepared plaster from mill powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint that is placed above the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of stars on the arm is six in several arrangements: whether it is a fracture in one fossa or in two fossae at the same time.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your splint over the fracture site stronger and firmer, and somewhat more with the splint towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards its lower part: or place a softer splint, a little bit shorter, according to what was said previously at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let cloths be rolled over the fracture, soft and damp cloths, and not hard, rough ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread for tightening be made of linen properly, medium between fine and coarse, as we have narrated.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens which requires rectification, such as itching that occurs in a limb: then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and let go of the limb without constriction until it subsides, and then repeat the constriction.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture has already been softened, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things to these: then rectify it all with your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	If nourishment is prevented from reaching a limb because of the excess tightness of a constriction, then it is necessary to soften it slightly and release it for several days until it heals itself to the nourishment, then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or about as many.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the infirm person shall be suspended to their neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its neck be equal, and be guarded by its virtue from agitating movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him lie upon his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the dispositions of complexions, and the dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	On the restoration of broken hands.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fractures of the fingers and joints of the hand rarely occur.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him unless many times attrition.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or abrasion of the foot occurs, then it is necessary that the sick person sit square and in front of him let there be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant shall extend the broken bones, and the physician shall set them, until when they are joined with good junction.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and a wad if an abscess does not occur hot.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the splint from above according to the amount of space; and you have now wrapped it in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is about the lower part of the foot near the belly, then make a sphere like shape from cloth: and order the sick man to bind it over it with his broken foot: then tighten it with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let a star be made from leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the foot; and bind it as is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If, however, the fracture is to the outside, then you ought: to place a splint above and another below in the sole of the foot: and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a bandage, like the turning of the hand; and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs to one of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be set accordingly.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it should be tightened with the sole: and if you will, put a straight splint on it, small: so that the fracture may be raised and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, or ring finger, and little finger, then it should be aligned and bandaged with the healthy finger that follows it; or all fingers should be bandaged according to their continuation, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place above it a small splint, as we said in the case of the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the same arrangement of the hot abscess: and oppose with it what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to how its story is repeated.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is broken many times, and it is declared to the senses because it is turned to the inner and outer part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is made so that one ligament is tightened above the fracture and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person shall lie upon his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he should extend every ligament to its part according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If it is a fracture near the root of the hip bone, then one ligament should be to the side of the crest, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if there is a fracture near the knee, then let the ligament near the knee be extended to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician straightens the bone with both his hands until he brings it back according to the likeness of its natural figure: and the bone is joined together with a good joining.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary, that you put a plaster and constriction, if it does not happen abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If it happens that an abscess forms there, then leave it for several days until the abscess sits and is warm, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	Its constriction ought to be so.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap over the fracture a hard cloth, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or thrice: and let there remain from it superfluity.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until you reach the heel at the root of the thigh.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the hip and leg near the knee to the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the thigh and hip what is superfluous from the belly.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place upon the hip at the site of the fracture one splint, and place from them one splint over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the cavities between the leg and hip with soft cloths so that the constriction is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong binding from the middle above the fracture site, in three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more it is elongated with a ligament from the place of the fracture, the less your constriction will be, and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then attend to the two extremities of the thread that you have introduced between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore bind with both three stars which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with two ends of thread to the lower part, until you reach the tendon of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when both are tightened, also bind the extremities of the stars from the other part so that the ligament is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let go of the constriction over it while it remains, so that it does not happen to the member, corrosion, or abscess, or inflation, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, after dissolving it properly, and rectify that which occurred from it, entirely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however in the bone there is a fragment of bone which pierces: then it is necessary, that you make it equal, if it is possible to you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find on that, and remove it; and care with him whose preceded take remembrance, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is tightened, besides which are added splints, as we have said in the adjunct and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Nevertheless, in restoring it broken like this, there does not occur lameness in the infirm.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if only one is restored, besides applying the other leg to it, then it is necessary that the one whose is it always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is taken away: all this is according to the diversity of complexions, and other arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	On the restoration of a broken knee cap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap is rare, but attrition happens very often.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If therefore it happens to him a fracture, then not except a fissure, or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it is placed upon that whole thing with sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that it be made equal to that which was broken from its parts with fingers until it is brought together, and joined according to what is possible from equality and facility, and workmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster made from sesame flour or millet, with egg white: and place upon this a round pad if you need it: and bind over it a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have recounted in other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and similar to it: so that you may oppose every accident with what is fitting for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a broken thigh bone.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is large and is called Femur, and the other slender and is called Fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens in both kinds of fractures that occurs to the two bones of the arm; and because of this restoration is made of it, just as restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If two bones are broken at the same time, the leg turns to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if a bone is fractured more subtly, the broken part turns towards the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if a thick bone is broken, find it below: and it is among those which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension and equalization and ligation of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if a fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many fragments: that an extension be minor, and with milder alleviation yours.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is, that when you equalize the stars, and complete all your operation, then receive two fascias from pine wood, which is administered in the fabrication of solar lamps that are placed under tables: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which have a small thickness, and not be from small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each piece of cloth two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg from one side, and the other from the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie two fasciae in three places from the two extremities and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	When a constriction is prevented, the leg turns to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed a splint should be administered from wood according to the length of the leg, and placed upon it the leg, so that it will preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And most of all it is necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is also a wound properly with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day and study it with the utmost care from abscesses, or inflammation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of these things happens, then oppose it with that which is necessary, until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On a fracture of the bones of the foot and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture through the heel bone does not occur.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the foot, and rarely in the fingers as well; and they do not happen to them unless by friction in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see those bones raised above each other, then let the sick person place his foot on the prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and place your foot upon that which rises from those bones; afterwards press, or tread upon it; and make it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and a pad on top; and put under the foot a small board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with a decent foot strap after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else is needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligament.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find bones equal, whether they are broken, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation therefore is, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your fingertip like a spatula according to the length of your finger, and let it be a little wider than that; then place this tablet under the foot which I have told you about, and bind it with a decent tightening.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If what is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place above every finger a star of its quantity, wrapped in a linen cloth: and bind the board to the lower foot: and let it stand on one head of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you that you do not forget, but consider all that I have said to you in the other fractures from accidents which we have spoken of: and oppose every accident with what is proper.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	On the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the rib bone, and the man’s groin.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is broken, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline it a little toward the back part of his body and hold it back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her womb with cotton, until it is filled: and let a sphere be made in the womb from this.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then beat the woman, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	This often emerges, until it is made in front of the gate of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small piece upon his back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore he wishes to urinate, let him remove the cotum with ease, then urinate; and reduce it back according to the way in which he introduced it at first; then return to his former position.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	He should do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and string over its opening a reed pipe, and insert the whole bladder into its vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within the wound, for the fracture will return.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it is filled with ointment and let it stand for several days, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the breast of a man or a woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and its equivalence that which we have narrated about the bone of the hip.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which occur infrequently, especially for one who has some study or use of it.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine well, because a fracture itself signifies to you in many arrangements the straight way in its restoration and its constriction: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When a man's phallus is broken, take a goose's gizzard and insert it into the penis.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then lay upon it a cloth wrapping and wrap it up, and let it be left for three days, or thereabouts, and it shall heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of a fracture of bones when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is suitable for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as of the hip bone, or of the shoulder, or similar to that, to hasten and to have him bled immediately; if the conditions for phlebotomy are attested to you, as we have previously said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If a wound is bleeding, then it is necessary to hasten to its amputation, so that powdered something crushed upon it be placed; if there is nothing else at hand.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day; and do not postpone it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If a hot abscess occurs, then dismiss its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess sits.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And you do not approach him on the third day, and on the fourth at all, for you would cause misfortune to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the broken bone is protruding above the skin and exposed: then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with ease and little extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however it is not prepared its extension and its equality with your hands: then reduce him with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity which he needs for that cure in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it not be doubled upon itself during compression upon it at the hour of the operation: and let it have a sharp edge, to which there is a margin at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be equal in thickness from its middle to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that the sharp end be placed upon the prominent part of the bone, and to drive it with one vice until when it returns and becomes equal to some equation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore endeavor to equalize the extremities of the fracture in alignment.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the end of it is broken finely and does not receive the instrument in good reception, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you are unable to reduce them as we have narrated entirely, then cut him with that which is suitable for him from the Incisions which we have said; or saw him with one saw in any way possible to you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape that which remains in the bone from roughness and tiny bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and the weak one finds after its reduction a violent pain striking, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do therefore that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For when you bring about the restoration of a limb that has been injured, it will have a great inconvenience upon the infirm.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black wine vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place on a wound a cauterizing material, nor anything which contains oil: lest it cause corruption and decay within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer splints at the hour of completing your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the wound be laid open: so that you cut with scissors a hole in the folds according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And with all caution, lest you tighten a wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times indeed foolish physicians have done this: and they caused to happen upon their sick either death, or corruption, or zuehem, that is, gangrene.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your stricture be soft, gentle, different from other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and fears some of the evils that we have narrated are present above it, and you find pain in the suspended place: then you should not put stars on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages of hard cloths in place of stars, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus, then remove the cloth which you placed upon it with wine from above.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer a liniment and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as ointment of the four drugs, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you that you loosen the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening until it is solidified and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass by wounds and it does not solidify, nor is the pus cut away from it: then know that there are small fragments of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary that you inquire about the wound with your touch.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those things are separated, remove them, and extract them themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separated from them, and prick the limb, and make it happen pain, try to cut them, and remove them in every way that is possible to you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If it happens that a wound is  swollen, or festering, that is, suppurating, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you oppose each of these with what is fitting for its cure, whose explanation precedes in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which it is necessary that my speech stand, and to whom you make present your mind when a bone is broken, and projects above the limb, such as the hip bone, and of the arm, and similar ones from large limbs, it is, that you do not presume the attraction of it, for many times it happens from this death, indeed let it go, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall of itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Therefore, care for the wound if it appears to you; and otherwise, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a knot in the track of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	Many times this Knot occurs in the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, which is near the joints, and it is disfigured from that figure of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents a limb from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, consider if the knot is recent: administer to it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Therefore, to receive from these some or all of them: and make them with a wine poultice, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them over the knot on the swab, and tighten them over the same good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the stricture, and do not loosen it over many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and repeat another one, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over the lead plate itself in a centered manner.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is a property of removing anything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the knot has already been turned into a stone and is tight, and urgent need calls for its removal; then find on it from the upper part of it, and cut away the protruding superfluity; or shave it with certain razors until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On healing when a limb is restored and remains subtle after it, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is repaired, and the limb remains afterwards delicate and weak, then it does not happen unless for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is the multitude of the solution of the ligament and its ligature not as it ought; or because of the excess of the stricture of ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from running to the limb; or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation in its not proper time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the sick person, and his weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the cure for him is, to feed the sick person, and make his body soft, until blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch over the limb: so that the pitch will draw to itself much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And keep applying this ointment with warm water until it draws out nourishment and returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of broken bones when they are set crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens to a limb already restored after its healing, that it has crookedness, and prominence of the broken bone, or knotting: and it is disfigured by this form of the limb, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural operation: then it is not necessary for you to receive the speech of him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And now there have been many foolish physicians and healers who have done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, so that it can be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and stiffness are recent: then it is necessary to poultice with lukewarm water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as althea leaves, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made with a softening plaster, like a diachylon made properly.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Either take mucus from the root of althaea and mix it with chicken fat, or sesame oil; and apply it as a poultice.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or ripe figs may be taken and ground with pigeon dung, and those similar to it which are named from medicines diminishing the formation of clots.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes a knot is loosened with frequent, old-fashioned, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the motion of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however the curvature has already preceded and become strong and turned into stone, and necessity has been brought about for its healing with iron: then it is necessary that the upper part of it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what is superfluous from the knot or bone be cut with fine incisors: and let ease be administered in this with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On Speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	A dislocation is an exit of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its movement, and the figure of the limb is defiled.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And he makes it happen that pains and grievous wounds befall the sick person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When therefore dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: and do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes an abscess, and perhaps with it a reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it ought not to be moved or extended during the hour of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because many times it causes spasm, and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when this happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to the bloodletting of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone until the abscess has subsided.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb will be seared with hot water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is to be restored with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And it should be treated every limb with it whose recollection comes to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocations, also according to what preceded concerning fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And dislocation of both occurs according to one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are moved from their places with little removal and softened for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation until they become softened to the part of the chest, until the patient's saliva flows and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however its dislocation is small, then it returns in many dispositions by itself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If, however, it is a complete and integral dislocation, then it is necessary that the reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and let the attendant hold the head of the sick person, and let the physician insert his thumb of one hand into the root of the jawbone dislocation between its bone, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may insert two fingers at once, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And let the remaining fingers of his hand be outside, with which he equalizes.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to cleanse his jaws and make them ready for eating to every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician straightens the jawbone and pushes the jawbone until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both mandibles are present at once: then administer a vapor with hot water and oil until easy reduction of both is achieved: nor delay the reduction of both entirely, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they are brought back and made level, and the bone of the weak one is closed, and they are not softened; then put on top of them little balls of cloth, with cerate which is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it is bound with ease with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sleep of the sick one be upon his back: and let his head be standing between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor does he attempt, or is compelled, to chew anything: indeed, let his food be given as a soft drink until when the pains are removed, and the jaw nods: then let him eat what he wants, and let it be administered to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not toil upon the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking, and conversation, until the jawbone is joined together, and has healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places, then often fevers and frequent chills happen, and perhaps the belly of the sick person is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When therefore you see that: then know, that it is destruction, and many times he who suffers that dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder, and the extremity of the upper arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula indeed does not dislocate from the inside, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And sometimes it is dislocated to the outside: and this is made known to the sense.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that he should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then bind the place with your hand firmly, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place over the same plaster, and pledgets, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities that follow the elbow and continue with it are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated on some day, then it must be reduced and set as we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put over the same plaster and wads and constriction.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And advise the sick person to adhere to tranquility and quiet until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure the limb of the humerus is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the humerus is not dislocated unless in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of these is to dislocate it to the part of the pubic bone below.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it be dislocated to the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and this rarely happens.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it is very much dislocated and moves downwards towards the groin, especially in those whose flesh is little.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it goes out quickly and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those whose flesh is much, it is the opposite, namely because it goes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people, a blow or a fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot boil, and it is thought because of this that it is dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you test it until you stand upon certainty of it, and then proceed in its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is known when it is towards the lower part of the joint, and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find among them a manifest diversity, and you find in the head of the Humerus concavity, and under the little mound at touch the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the weak one cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a clear touch, and it is not concealed.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this kind of dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent, or when the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And the reduction of it is, that he lift his hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his knuckle, and elevate the joint with strength upwards to its place; and the assistant shall elevate his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he places it lower, for it itself returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred at first, then it is necessary that the patient should bathe in hot water, and an embrocation be given which softens and soothes, such as if the roots of rue, fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person is laid on his back and a sphere of wool placed under his head, which is equal between softness and firmness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician places his heel upon the sphere and elevates the shoulder with strength, and draws the hand of the infirm to the lower part.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant shall hold the head of the sick person so that it does not move downward: for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and let it be, as you make the present man who is longer than the sick one stand beside him, and put his shoulder under the arm of the sick one: and raise his arm up above, until the sick one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant shall draw the hand of the infirm person to his lower belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If, however, the sick person is light: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else, so that it weighs him down: for the dislocation immediately returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another way: and it is, as if a long piece of wood were laid on the ground, whose head is round in shape: like the sleeve of a dead man's shirt: which is not thick, nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then put soft cloths under the patient after placing them on a head of wood; and let the patient stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then the hand is extended toward the lower part on the other side, and the body is extended from the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is, to take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a rounded head so that it will be relieved in entering the depth of the wound, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are bound over the round head so that it does not damage the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then a support should be placed under the patient’s armpit so that the hand or arm may be extended over wood up to the lower part; and the wood is tightened above the support and arm and extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm shall be placed upon the step of a ladder across its width, and the hand shall be extended downwards, and the rest of the body shall be suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The union therefore comes about immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When therefore the entrance is completed according to whatever way possible: then it is necessary that you place under the ligature a sphere equal in quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place a prepared plaster made from ground powder with frankincense and egg white over the whole shoulder, as it turns over from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten under the bandage with a gentle constriction: and the ligament is rolled over the plaster from above: and the hand of him is tied to the neck of him, and it is let go, and the hand of him be not moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person, until the limb has been strengthened: because it is more quickly restored to health.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger dressing should be placed after seven days, or five, and it should be removed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is hardened and does not soften, then now it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, a joint is dislocated many times, on account of the humidity that happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that cautery be administered to it with three holes, according to what has been said before in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all of this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and the dressing is applied again and tightened on it several times, and it does not hold firm, and falls off, and it cannot be elevated to the upper part: then know that the nerves of it which are to the head of the shoulder, have already been cut or extended or softened: and know that the joint will never join in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The dislocation which occurs towards the chest and nipple, or to the back, is reduced by thrusting and extending with the hands until it returns, and thereafter the remaining tightness and care are administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If it happens after healing that there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the sick person use a bath many times until that heaviness is alleviated and returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly it returns with difficulty also: and indeed it is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the anterior, or to the posterior.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it is falling under sight and touch, according to whichever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated joint with a healthy one, it will be clear to you manifestly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is concave, and it cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it happens that he has a hot abscess, its reduction is difficult: and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is in the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and more painful to them; and many times death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And restoration of it when it is one of those things that can be reduced, is, that the hand be extended with two hands: and his arm be spread out, and the hands of the physician be above the elbow and below it, and he impel the joint with thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front, then it returns so that it doubles the hand with its own hand until it strikes with the root of its palm its elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a strong and violent extension; and it is that two attendants extend the arm: and they also hold it so that it does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rolled back to every part after it has been wrapped above its hand with a doubled length of cloth or a wide bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when a physician touches the joint with his hand, he shall anoint it with oil: that it may be one of those which help in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then drive the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, which has astringency and drying power with the membrane of an egg; and let the constriction be tightened moderately.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm shall be suspended from the neck of the infirm: and let it be dismissed for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it shall be untied.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is fixed in its place, then release the ligament from it, and dismiss it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not well joined, then repeat the bandage and ligament, and leave it for several days until it tightens.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then, dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however it happens to him heaviness after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in motion: then administer moisture in bathing, and gentle rubbing, and compression, until it lies flat, or put upon the joint of the hip, that is, a thick wool pad.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound, and let it be left on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it and introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore he sweats, then rub the joint with friction tempered.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over the same wound with one sponge, and second, and third with the introduction of a bath, until it softens.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over it itself feces of cow, wet, heated with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is indeed softened and returns to its own condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of dislocations Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joints of the hands are often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Opposite the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that speed be in the reduction of the dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place suppurates; or a hot suppuration will occur in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of a dislocation in this consists, that you place Mahasem's hand of the infirm hand upon the board, and extend the minister's hand: and let the physician place his palm upon the prominence of the joint, and thrust it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Nonetheless, it should be considered, if the palm has already retreated to the belly of the hand: then the sick person shall place the back of his hand upon a table during extension and reduction: and if the dislocation proceeds toward the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be intrinsically upon the table, that is, the inner part of his hand upon the table, so that the hand of the physician may fall upon the very eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess: and dismiss him, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If he does not tolerate it, and you cannot manage his reduction after some days have passed, but the joint nevertheless remains according to its contortion, and it does not harm the sick man except that it softens the hand, and he cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves have been cut or worn down.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no talent in it, unless it be tightened with a cautery near its case.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that thing does not matter.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Almahassem does not return, then place over him the plaster which we have narrated.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is bound, and left for five days; afterwards it is loosened and left, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If its movement is prevented and something heavy falls on it, then soften it with warm water and friction several times until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the cure of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its place, whether the finger be dislocated to any part, or the finger to the back of the palm, or to its belly: then extend the finger, and drive the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend it toward the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend him and extend him until he becomes straight on his day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore night shall have come, bind him according to the very narrative: and do not cease to loose him during the day: and exercise him with motion: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do with him if it is dislocated to the belly of the hand: and bind him to that part, and do with him your first operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do when it is dislocated to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone a dislocation of the vertebra of the back, or neck, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death quickly approaches the infirm.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the stool of the sick person comes out involuntarily and he cannot hold it back; and oftentimes some limbs of his are softened, or two legs of him, or two arms of him, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it is often removed, and often removal of them occurs to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is moved to the rear, is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of this is, as you consider, if gibbosity happens from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that which happens from chance, or percussion, or similar things, ancients have already said ways of cure in a lengthy discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I myself have now shortened it from that one, which is scarcely excusable from much of its proximity to my intention: and in my exposition which I have laid out and formed its instrument in a different manner than they displayed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore that in humping which happens from the front part, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is done to both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them except that which happens on the back properly, as I tell you: and it is, as if the infirm person stretches himself over his face over a level platform near the wall: and under him spread a wet bandage so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight fixed piece of wood shall be placed in the trench in the ground, at the end of the foot, about the head of it: and another piece of wood about its feet at the other end of the foot: and let the assistant hold the wood, and let it not be firmly fixed in the trench.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap around the head of the sick person, and under his scalp's ligament a soft, firm one; and extend the extremity of the ligament to the wood that is at its head; and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another ligament above the folds of it, and above its knees, and at its groins.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the ligaments and tie them together in a second piece of wood that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every minister extend to the part of the wood a ligament, and do not move two ligaments from their places where they are fixed; however, let them not be fastened, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician places his palms upon the spine with strength, until it returns; or places a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he binds his feet above the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And a cavity in the wall of which we said that it is near the weak place, a place into which the extremity of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place a middle board upon the Spondilium.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet upon the other extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tighten well until it is constricted, the spina, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	If you wish, operate with a tool that is wrapped around your hand: and it is, as you fix in the ground at the head of the sick person in the last foot two planks, whose length is the length of one arm: and at his head in the last foot two planks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between every piece of wood be one palm; and now it has been made in every place a hole, in which runs a saw; and let the whole wood be firmly fixed on the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round piece of wood is inserted: and it is a lathe in which the ligament is turned in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it is a hole, into which a piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with that which revolves: and in two other pieces of wood there is similarly this.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then bind the ligaments that you have tightened in the chest of the sick person with a turn that is at his head: and the ligaments that you have tightened in his legs in a turn that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let there be at every lathe a servant who turns his hand with a strap, with which the lathe is rotated: and the physician levels the spine, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of a tourniquet which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the Spondilis has returned and the place is evened, then it is necessary that you place a dried plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, a plug.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place above the plaster a star from a board, whose width is three fingers, or about that much.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the quantity which it takes up of the gibbosity, and over the part of the sound vertebra.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the ligature which we said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use a subtle diet, until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the application of the tablet which we have narrated for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is administered there.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there happens a prominence at the last vertebra of the back: and it is thought through that dislocation, and it is that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not right that presumption should be made with this medicine, for perhaps it will bring about death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of a dislocated hip joint.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joints of the hip and the shoulder do not occur except for dislocation alone; nor does it happen to them as happens to other joints from a small removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the articulation of the Anca is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is because it is displaced forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is most displaced inwards: and little displaced outwards, and backwards.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the cure for its dislocation inward is: because when you join the sound leg with the unsound one, it is longer: and its knee is prominent more than the sound one, and the unsound one cannot fold its foot at the groin: and there is a place that follows the groin abscess with a hot abscess, because the head of the hip has already arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one who has a dislocation outwards is that his occurrences are contrary to these occurrences.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him to whom a dislocation happens to the front, is, because he extends his healthy leg according to its measure: however, he does not double it without pain which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot step over it to the front: and his urine is retained, and his groin becomes inflamed, and when he walks, his foot falls on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one who has a dislocation to the rear is that he cannot straighten his knee nor can he bend it before he bends his groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and his groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation, however, is as follows, if you consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already aged with him who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	If then you administer a reduction of it, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, one ought not to presume it entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that case, in which the dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, so that you may wish to join the joint, and extend it to the interior and exterior, and move it with your right and left hand: for perhaps it will return, and does not need other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If this does not work, then it is necessary that a strong assistant be prepared, and he extends the leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is bound above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under the scrotum.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he will tighten with a soft bandage above the root of the hip, and hold the extremity of another ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the front part of the groin to the shoulder point, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their extension all be as one, until the sick person is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is a common kind among the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with that which we said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary to do all kinds of that which I shall say about the proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	When indeed a dislocation is towards the interior, it is necessary for the patient to be laid upon his sound side in the reduction.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he places a ligature over the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upward from the groin region to the higher part of the body, to the clavicle area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another person shall take strong arms and reduce the large place of the weak hip and extend it outwards with vigorous extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier of the remaining kinds of cure, in which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If he excuses himself from you and does not obey you concerning the entrance with this kind of cure at all: then it is necessary that two feet be bound together with a strong, gentle ligature upon two heels and upon two knees: and let the length of each be four finger-widths from its fellow: and let the infirm leg be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be suspended over the head of a beam which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong youth to brace the hip joint; and let another support the weak one when found; and let another youth drive, bracing the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In setting it [the bone] back into place on its own, when there is a dislocation outward, it is necessary that the sick person lie upon a platform, according to what we have narrated in the one who has a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And bind the ligament above his leg, which is properly weak, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two planks are placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a piece of wood added in the middle of the foot should be placed, well fixed: over which damp cloths should be wrapped so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the wood be between his hips so that it is not pulled down at extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let every assistant extend to his part, and the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place upon the same tablet and press it, as we said in the prominence, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Nonetheless, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the injured person be extended quickly: and this is according to this same account on the bench: and the physician puts the palm of his right hand above the groin of the injured person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he narrows it with the other hand, and with that narrowing he places it extended downwards to the lower part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the posterior part: then it is not necessary that the infirm be extended downward and raised above the ground; rather it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard thing, as it is necessary, as it is also done if the dislocation is in the anterior part, according to what we said about his lying on two planks: and it is over his face, and the ligaments are extended, according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that a compress with a board be applied even to the place where the joint exits, when reduction is completed as it should be.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the infirm: and when you see them equal, and the infirm tightens his leg, and expands it without excuse: then know, that now the limb returns, according to what is proper: then join the two hips, and put a plaster, and bind with an immemati, that is, a wheel: so that it may not move an inch to any part: and the infirm adheres to quiet for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in state, then know that the dislocation is now firm: therefore dismiss the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something that needs softening: then return and apply a bandage to it, and tighten it according to your first tightness: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it slow down in walking on both sides for several days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated externally, internally, and downward, namely posteriorly.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is, that you order the infirm to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If it does not adhere with the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all kinds of dislocation of it is, that you make the sick person sit straight, so that now he may extend his leg if he can above it, and adhere your back to his face: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then cause his knee to adhere with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers upon his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm both sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant shall stretch his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of healing is that the leg adheres with the hip joint gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster him, and adhere the leg to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind that together with a strip for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then dissolve it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let not the sick person walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with ligaments, about which I have previously spoken in the treatment of the  ankylosis, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of calcaneal dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	Sometimes the heel bone is removed by a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its position.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is made, either inwards, or outwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus inflated, proceeding to the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal is easy restoration: and it is, that it be extended with ease with the hands, and be leveled until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of this ailment when it is dislocated according to its full extent, you must make the sick person sit straight. And let a strong attendant hold him firmly by the middle of his back from behind.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold his foot with your right hand from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot where the heel is.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot to you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with two left vices.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left and drive the chest of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do it twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the chest of the foot towards the leg with a third splint and you will draw the haw.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns to the vice one or two according to this manner, and you see the foot level, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it; because it itself returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, reduction is prevented for you with what we have narrated: then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a small piece of earth firmly on the ground, so that it falls between his hips: and you have already wrapped him in cloth so that he does not harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the assistant take his hip; afterward let another assistant extend his foot, either with his hands or with a bandage which is tied above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every assistant stretch against the stretching of his own comparison: and a cushion shall be standing between the two hips of the infirm, holding him, that he is not drawn down to the lower parts in the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the sound leg toward the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore a dislocation returns, and its health of return is declared to you: then put a plaster and padding, and tightly bind it with cords, and bind the foot with a cord to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear of the nerves which are above the heel bone, so that the ligament above them is not too strong and damages them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him be dismissed for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If he attempts to walk before that space of time, it is not safe unless the dislocation will be resolved upon him, and corrupted, and does not receive after that healing.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If it happens to him a hot abscess: then you ought to administer to him that which we recounted before in another place concerning the cure, and an ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	On the dislocation of the toes and their treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated be set with slight extension without effort; and indeed this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If dislocation is in certain nodes of the foot's back: then it is necessary that the sick person makes his foot sit upon an equal place to earth, or upon a board: and he stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand and put your foot upon that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see that it is even, and does not appear prominent in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under his foot a board which will take up the whole foot, with two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it tightly with a bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then, set it [the broken bone] and have him rest from walking for many days until it tightens and heals from the setting.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	On the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this sort happens and you attempt its healing and restoration, many times death ensues: and because of this, it is not proper that one presumes to heal this kind of thing unless he is prudent in the art, long used, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and that he use in inception medicines which assuage hot abscesses only: and dismiss the sick by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	If you do not understand, or hope for salvation from destruction with the gentleness of sickness, and in which something appears to be hopeful.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the limb returns, according to what we wish, then administer a regimen that calms the abscess; and care for the wound with that which is suitable to it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If dislocation occurs with a fracture, and there are splinters of bone in the separated parts, then attempt to remove them, and do what we have said in simple ailments from what precedes in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear: according to what my prediction has preceded you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthful to your body among those who are yours at your time.
