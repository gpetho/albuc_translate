Chapter Seven:
On the Cauterization of Chronic Apoplexy
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with the remedies we have mentioned and the medication does not help and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on all the horns of the head; with a cautery iron in the middle of the head as we have described; and with a cautery on the nape of the neck.
The method of cauterization is done as previously described.
And it is also cauterized on the pit of the stomach; and this is more posterior; then treat with what has been previously mentioned.
