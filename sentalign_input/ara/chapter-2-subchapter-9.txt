Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of coldness occurring in the eyelids.
Often something appears on the eyelids resembling coldness in its intensity and hardness.
And for that reason it is called coldness, and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid. The procedure for them is that you examine, and if the coldness is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, moving to every side, then its treatment is easy, so make a horizontal incision on it.
Then peel it from every side gently until it is detached, then lift it with a hook and cut it. If it is not possible for you to cut it except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm the patient at all.  If the incision is large, bring it together with stitching and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm for you from it, for the ointment will repair it and heal it. If the coldness is tending towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and lift the coldness with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it away from every side.
If you penetrate the eyelid with the cutting, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the coldness with salt water and treat the area with something that heals, until the patient recovers.
