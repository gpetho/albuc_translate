On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Chapter 32.
Know that in the joints of the hip and the shoulder, only dislocation occurs; they are not subject to the minor displacements and depressions that happen in other joints.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four directions.
That is, it may be dislocated forward and backward.
Most frequently, it dislocates inward; and it rarely dislocates forward or backward.
The treatment for an inward dislocation is this: when you place the patient's healthy leg together with the affected one, it appears longer, and the knee protrudes more than that of the healthy leg. The patient cannot bend his foot near the groin, and the area near the groin is swollen with a hot abscess because the head of the hip has already reached there.
The sign of an outward dislocation is that its symptoms are the opposite of these.
The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient extends his healthy leg completely; however, he cannot bend it without pain in the knee. If he tries to walk, he cannot step forward on it; he retains urine, his groin is swollen, and while walking, he steps on his heel.
The sign of a backward dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor bend it before bending the groin. His leg is also shorter than the other, the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is near the place of the hip bone.
The reduction of each type of dislocation is to be considered if the dislocation is old and has become chronic in the patient.
Then if you attempt the reduction and it stays in place, it is not in need of further treatment.
Therefore, it should not be presumed to require treatment at all.
In the case of a recent dislocation of one of the four types, proceed by rotating the joint, extending it inward and outward, and moving it right and left; it may return to place and need no further treatment.
If it does not return in this way, then a strong assistant should be prepared to extend the patient's leg from below, either with his hands or with a band placed above the knee on his leg. Another assistant should extend the arm from above, inserting his hands under the patient's armpits.
Then he should tighten a soft band over the base of the hip and hold the other end of the band.
The extension should be either from the front part of the groin to the upper chest or from the back to the spine.
All extensions should happen at once until the patient is lifted from the ground with his body hanging.
This type of extension is the general method for all four types.
If the dislocation returns in the manner described, it is good; if not, then each type will need its own specific treatment, as I will now explain.
In the specific reduction for an inward dislocation, the patient should lie on his healthy side.
Then place a band over the base of the hip, between the head of the hip and the place under the groin.
Then extend the band upward from the groin area to the upper part of the body, toward the chest.
Next, another strong assistant should take hold of his arms and press the thick area of the affected hip, extending it forcefully outward.
For now, it returns to its place.
And this method is the easiest of the other types of treatments for returning this limb to its place.
But if it resists you and does not yield in this way of treatment at all, then the patient's two feet must be bound together with a strong, soft band over both heels and both knees; each should be separated from the other by a length of four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended two fingers' length longer than the other.
Then suspend the patient over the top of a beam that is within the house, at a height of about two arm-lengths from the ground.
Then instruct a strong young man to support the head of the hip; another youth should be suspended with the patient, and another youth should push, pressing the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
For its specific reduction when the dislocation is outward, the patient should lie on a platform, as we described for someone with a hunch.
And let a band be bound over his affected leg and across his chest.
Then place two pieces of wood, one by his feet and the other by his head.
Then place an additional wooden piece securely fixed in the middle of the platform, over which wet cloths are wrapped so it does not harm the patient; and place the wood between his thighs so that he is not pulled downward during the extension.
Then let each assistant extend in their respective direction, and the physician aligns the reduction with his hand.
If it responds to the reduction, that will be good.
And if not, place him on the board and press it, as we described for a hunch, evenly.
However, the patient should lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is forward, the patient’s leg should be quickly extended; this follows the same procedure on the platform: and the physician places his right palm over the affected groin.
Then, with the other hand, compress it, and with that compression, push it downwards toward the knee.
And if the dislocation is backward, then the patient should not be extended downward, but instead lifted above the ground. In this case, he should be placed on a hard surface, as should also be done if his hip dislocates outward, according to what we described about his lying on both hips: he lies face down, with the bands extended, as we recently described.
And it is necessary to apply compression with a board over the area where the joint is displaced, once the reduction is completed as it should be.
The sign that it has returned will not escape you: it is when you extend both of the patient’s legs and observe them to be equal, and the patient moves his leg and extends it without difficulty. Then you will know that the limb has returned as it should. Then join the two hips, apply a plaster, and secure it with a support, called a "wheel," so that the hip does not move in any direction. The patient should remain at rest for three or four days.
Then loosen the band and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; if you see them equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation has been fixed: release the patient to walk.
And if you observe any softening, then go back, apply the plaster again, and bind it with the same tightness as before, and leave it again for three days.
Then loosen it and have him walk slowly on both legs for a few days until he regains full strength.
