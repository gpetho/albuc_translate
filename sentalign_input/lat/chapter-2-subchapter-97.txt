On the application of leeches.
Chapter 99.
Leeches are not applied in many places, except in areas where cupping is not possible due to their small size, such as the lip, gum, and similar areas.
Or in parts lacking flesh, such as the finger, nose, and similar areas.
The quality of leeches to be used is that they come from fresh waters, free from impurities.
Then, let them stay day and night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Then cleanse the body first with bloodletting and cupping.
Then cleanse the affected area until it is red.
Afterwards, place them on it.
When they are full and fall off, if suction at the site with a cup is possible, this is more beneficial; if not, wash the site with vinegar.
Then with plenty of water, rub and squeeze it.
If the blood flow continues after the leeches fall off, and it seeps, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top, until the seepage stops.
If the blood increases, then sprinkle powdered alum or galls or similar astringents over it, until the bleeding stops.
Or place halves of peeled beans over the site and leave them until the beans adhere, for the bleeding will stop.
If the repetition of leech application is necessary, they should be changed when possible.
If leeches are prevented from adhering, then clean the site with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle at the site until some blood flows out.
Then place them, for as soon as they sense some blood, they will immediately adhere.
When you want them to fall off, sprinkle powdered aloe, salt, or ashes over them, and they will fall off immediately.
