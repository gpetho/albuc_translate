 CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN.
On the treatment of the rupture that occurs in the groin.
 Sometimes there occurs a rupture in the groin as we have said, and the part protrudes.
No portion of the intestine descends into the scrotum; or if anything it will be only a tiny portion and will reduce at any time.
But if it goes on for a long time the rupture in the membrane increases until the bowel and omentum descend into the scrotum.
It arises from a stretching of the membrane in the groin, as we said; the membrane stretches and then relaxes and the place swells.
Its treatment by the cautery is as I have already described.
Sometimes also it is treated with the knife in this manner: With the patient lying back before you, make an incision three fingers wide, transversely across the swelling of the rupture which projects.
Then perforate the subcutaneous tissues so as to expose the white membrane that lies under the skin alongside the rupture.
Take a probe and place it upon the projecting part of the fascia and push it back into the depths of the abdomen.
Then sew together the two swollen portions of membrane over the end of the probe and suture the one to the other.
Then take out the probe.
On no account make the incision into the fascia nor touch the testis nor anything else, as I taught you on the subject of treating the intestinal hernia.
Then dress the wound, and when the stitches come apart remove them and bandage the wound again until it is healed over.
For the membrane will draw together and the rupture will not come out again.
But the cautery is better at this spot, for it is safer.
