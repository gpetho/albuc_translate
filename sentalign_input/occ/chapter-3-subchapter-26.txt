Chapter XXVI
On the reduction of dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated downward towards the armpit.
The second is that it is dislocated upward, which happens rarely; it is not dislocated backward towards the shoulder blade, nor is it dislocated forward towards the nerves.
It is mostly dislocated outward and downward towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, where it dislocates easily; but in those with more flesh, it is more difficult to dislocate.
Often, due to a blow or fall, the muscle becomes inflamed and is mistaken for a dislocation.
Therefore, you must ascertain this before being certain, and then proceed with the treatment.
The dislocation is recognized when it is downward towards the armpit; you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle by noting a noticeable difference; you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and below the armpit towards the muscle head's touch like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear or move it in all directions.
If it is dislocated towards the chest or upward, then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
This dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent and the patient is a child.
The reduction involves the assistant raising the patient's hand upwards; then placing the thumbs below the armpit, and lifting the joint forcefully to its place, raising the patient's hand and extending it upwards; then gently resting it as it returns easily.
But if it does not return as we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then the patient should be bathed in warm water and given a poultice to soften and relax as if it were made from marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and this should be applied.
Then the patient should lie on their back and a woolen pad of moderate firmness be placed under the armpit, and the doctor places their heel on the pad, lifting the muscle head forcefully, and pulling the patient's hand to prevent downward movement, while another assistant holds the patient's head to prevent downward movement, so it returns to its place quickly.
If you prefer, reduce it this way: have a person taller than the patient stand on the side and place their shoulder under the patient's armpit, lifting it upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand downward from their abdomen.
But if the patient is light, they should be suspended with additional weight, so it adds enough weight, causing the dislocation to return quickly.
Another easy method is to place a long wooden pole on the ground with a round top, like a pestle, not too thick or thin, and place it under the patient; then cover the top of the pole with soft cloths, have the patient lie along the length of the pole, and extend their arm downward from the other side; and stretch their body on the opposite side forcefully, so the joint returns to its place quickly.
If reducing it is difficult despite all the mentioned methods, use this method: take a wooden pole about two arms long, four fingers wide, and its thickness reduced under the armpit according to this shape:
Then wrap the round top with soft cloth so the pole does not hurt the patient.
Then place it under the patient's armpit, and extend their hand or arm over the pole downward, and tie the pole around the support and the arm and hand extremity.
Then place the arm on a step of a ladder horizontally, extending the hand downward, and suspend the body on the other side, so the joint repositions quickly.
Once the repositioning is complete by any method possible for you, place a wool pad of equal size under the armpit; then apply a poultice made of ground flour mixed with vinegar and egg white over the whole muscle, wrapping it, and bandage it tightly under the armpit; the bandage should be wrapped over the poultice, and the hand attached to the neck, leaving it immobile for seven days.
The patient's food intake should be limited until the limb is strengthened, as this aids in recovery.
Afterward, increase the food intake gradually after seven or five days and encourage some movement; if it stabilizes without softening, then it is healed.
But if the joint frequently dislocates due to humidity or other causes, then it should be treated with cauterization with three burns, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
If after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not stable, and the poultice and bandage have been reapplied several times without success, and the arm cannot be raised upwards, know that the nerves at the muscle head are either cut, stretched, or softened, and the joint will never be set in its place.
For the dislocation towards the chest and the breast or the back parts, reduction is done by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns.
Apply the other bandage to it, and treat it until it is healed.
If after healing, the limb feels heavy and movement is slow, the patient should take frequent baths until the heaviness is relieved and the limb returns to its original state.
