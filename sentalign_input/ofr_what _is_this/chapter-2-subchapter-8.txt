about the flesh of eyelids
These little swellings that come on the eyelids when they are moist and dry, you should stretch them with forceps and tweezers, and cut them from their roots with a spatula; then put ground vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after incision is worth more; and they often return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
