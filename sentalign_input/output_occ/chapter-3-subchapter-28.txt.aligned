On the treatment of wrist dislocation, which is the joint between the arm and the hand.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the wrist.	0.7188807
The wrist is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, unlike other joints, but it is important to reduce it quickly before it becomes an inflamed abscess.	The carpus of the hand is often dislocated. Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.	0.80791384
The reduction is done by placing the patient’s wrist on a table, with an assistant extending the hand, while the doctor presses on the joint prominence with his hand or palm, pushing until it returns to its place.	The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.	0.85510147
However, if the palm is already facing the forearm, the patient should place the back of the hand on the table for extension and reduction; if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, the hand should be positioned palm down on the table so the doctor’s hand can press on the joint prominence.	But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself.	0.8325921
If it returns quickly, it is good; if not, then apply a poultice to prevent abscess and leave it; do not repeat this, as it may not endure further reduction attempts.	If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be. Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed.	0.77439815
But if the joint remains twisted, it does not harm the patient except the hand becomes weak and cannot grip; then know the nerves are cut or bruised, and the only remedy is cauterization near the injury, which may help somewhat.	But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised. In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all.	0.8332667
Once the wrist is returned, apply the poultice as recommended, leave it and bandage it for five days; then remove the bandage and exercise the hand.	When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.	0.8609644
But if movement is restricted and heaviness occurs, relieve it with warm water and gentle rubbing several times until it is alleviated.	If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.	0.8348217
