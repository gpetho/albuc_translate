Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After completing this book for you, O sons, which is the last science in medicine with its complement, and following it to a conclusion, I found that it was my pleasure to complete it in this book, by explaining its parts and its declarations, so that I could complete it for you along with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, chirugy with my hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	For operation with the hand is laid low in our region and entirely cut off: until perhaps knowledge of it perishes, and its trace is erased: and they do not remain except small descriptions in ancient books, which have changed hands: and an error and hesitation has come to them, until their intentions are closed, and the time of this one is elongated: It seemed good to me to live it with the order of this treatise in it according to life from its position, and its declaration and abbreviation: and to resemble the forms of the furnaces of Cauterius, and other instruments of work: when it is added by the declaration, and by its operation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, the cause why this good artisan did not find it with his hand in our time, is that medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise before this in the knowledge of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the excitement of the members, and their forms, and their union, and their separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and the number of them, and their exit, and the pulsars, and the quiet places, and the exits of their places:
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And for that Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little, and especially in the art of hands.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is unaware of what we say about anatomy, does not shout, thinking that he still stands on the error from which men are beheaded: just as I have seen many of them, who are formed from this science, and throw themselves without knowledge and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	What this is, because I have seen a stupid physician cut the gumma of a swollen tumor in the neck of a woman, and some arteries were cut in her neck: therefore blood flowed from the woman until she died, lying at his feet.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another physician who presumed to extract a stone that had passed through the urinary tract of a young man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore he went to him and extracted it with a forceps.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	And the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	I myself had already called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the weakness of its position that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who took the stitch from a servant of one of our dukes for medical reasons: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was near his heel, a fracture in his wrist: and the physician, out of ignorance, tightened the fracture on the palm with nails, and with strong rods, and did not release the expiration of the wound.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his greediness.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he released him for some days, and commanded him not to untie the bandage: and he stood like this until the gumma of his foot was swollen, and his own foot, and he was led to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was called to him, and I went to loosen the bandage: and peace followed, and his pains ceased.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption had already been established in the member: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then let the corruption walk around in the member, until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who had pierced a cancerous apoplexy: and the wound became after days, until the malice of his own lord made it great with him.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when there is a pure cancer from the black bile, it does not behoove him to come near with a hammer at all, unless it be in the member that can endure, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for this reason, O son, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation which is associated with safety: and the operation, which is dangerous in many positions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already stirred up in all the places of this book, where the operation comes, in which there is fear and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to protect that, and let it go: so that fools may not come to speak and to dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take the measure with anxiety and protection, and your weak ones with ease and firmness, and use a better help of God's grace for salvation and laudable success: and let go of difficult cures of terrible diseases: and take your souls away from him who makes you to fear, so that he may enter into superstition in our faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining for your glory, and sublime in this world, and finally for your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	You should not cure the sickness with evil: do not call the physicians bad.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now then, this treatise has been divided into three chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	Chapter first.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter first, about cauterization with fire, and cauterization with sharp medicine, a treatise arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of the instruments and tools of cauterization, and all that is necessary for the operation. ¶
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter second, about sectioning and piercing, bloodletting and venting, and wounds: and the removal of arrows and similar things, and the whole treatise arranged according to the forms of the instruments. ¶
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Chapter fourth, about restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisted things, and similar things: the treatise arranged from the head to the feet, and according to the forms of the instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part one.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	¶ Of injury and cauterization, and when it suits, and which complexions agree, and at what time, and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter one.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before that, before the operation, it is necessary to say the quality of the injuries and cauterizations of his own, and in which complexion it will be shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say that the speech about the quality of the injury and cauterization of his own is a long and subtle speech, a science, and a hidden and secret one.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Even a great number of wise men have spoken in it, and they have disputed in it, and for me, indeed, it is enough little from their words, fearing the prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say that cauterization is effective universally on all wounds, whether with matter or without matter, except for two wounds, which are burn wounds without matter and dry wounds without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in hot and dry wounds with matter, they differ.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that cauterization is in the hot and dry wound.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	However, others have said that cauterization is not suitable in the disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat: and it is not suitable to heal from the hot and dry disease with the hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite has said that by cauterization a wound is made in all hot and dry disease that occurs in the bodies of humans: because when you compare the body of a human to its humors, you find the body of a human to be cold when compared to fire.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I myself say by his words: because I have already experienced this through experiment, it will do that several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Nevertheless, it does not belong for him to come on that, unless he has already proved it, and practiced in the chapter of cauterization, and knows the diversity of human wounds, and the arrangement of diseases in themselves, and their causes and accidents, and the time of their occurrence.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, for the rest of the wounds there is no fear in you: and especially in cold and damp diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	Indeed, all physicians have come to them: and they have not differed in the wound with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And you know, O sons, that by the secret of healing with cauterization with fire, and the goodness of it over medicine burning is: because fire is simple, whose action does not harm, except to the member that is cauterized: and it does not hurt the other connected member, unless it harms slightly.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning surgeons in medicine is directed towards that which is extended from the limbs: and perhaps it causes a difficult disease to occur in the affected member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, fire, due to its own subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed, we have learned this by experiment, due to the length of the apprenticeship and study with the art, and the station on the truth of things: and for that I excuse the length of the speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if there were not, because it is not permitted for this book of mine to bring you a secret, hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases that are demonstrated by philosophical language, which is disturbed by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And do you know, sons, that you yourself disagree in the time when it is most fitting for the cauterization to be made, and you set a better time for the lesson.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that the cauterization is fitting in every time, because the harm that happens by the time is submerged in the wound, which is attracted with the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterization is for the pains that are necessary for the pains, which are hard, and urgent, which do not endure the delay: because it is feared from them that a greater malice may happen than the small harm that is done by the delay.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And it will not fall in your minds, O sons, that this is not believed, unless you are vile and stupid physicians, namely that the diseases which are cured by the cauterization are not always a return: and they set it down as a consequence, and the thing is not as it seems: therefore because the cauterization is not but in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and dries up the humors which are causes of the pains, therefore do the pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Indeed, cauterization benefits from the excess of medicine due to its own health, and the strength of its operation, and the swiftness of its lord's dominion: and it is possible that the illness lasts for a certain period of time according to the complexion of the weak, and the location of his illness, and the strength of his illness: and that it is prepared in the body of him from the aggregation of the excess in him: and that it nourishes to it in acquisition from his food, and similar ones from like causes, unless it becomes illness in which the cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a member of few excess and moisture, such as the tooth cauterization, for pain, and similar ones, is possible that it does not remain in that pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But my speech is again a word of wisdom: not to what they intend in it, for they believe that there is no cure which concurs with the medicine, nor with another after the occasion of the cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the case is opposite to that, and the intent of saying that cauterization is the last remedy, is not, unless when we administer modes of cure in some diseases, and they do not concur with the medicine: then we administer at the end of the cauterization, and it concurs: then it falls out that cauterization is the last remedy, not according to the intention which wise and experienced physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than with iron: and they did not say this except for the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that it does not make a pus in the place of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	Indeed, that is not entirely true. For I have already proven that, and found that it does not make that in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	The cauterium, when used by itself, is good, and better than iron, as they have said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	Indeed, when you use the cauterium with fire made of gold, it is not declared to you when it is ignited according to the quantity you wish, because of the reddish color of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add more ignition above it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls away from that in his work: and therefore, the cauterium is used by us more skillfully and nearer with iron, because of the directness to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	Indeed, I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization, according to the chapter: and I have arranged them from the head to the feet: so that they may be sought out by those who wish for that from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	¶ About the manner of cauterizing the head in a circular incision.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is applied to the dominion of moisture and coldness over the head: which are two causes of salt, and the multitude of fluids from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of dreams, and pain of teeth, and pain of the throat: and in general, all sickness that happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and such like from these diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, to first apply it to the weak: so that it may be expelled in the beginning with the medicine softened and cleansed of the head three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then he should ask him to make a cut on his own head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit with his hands squarely between your hands, so that he has already placed his own hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the palm of your hand over his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Then mark the spot with your middle finger as it passes.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then use the olive-oil cauterant: whose form is as follows.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it over the marked spot with your hand lowered, gradually contracting your hand, and you rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly pull back your hand, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already that the amount of bone in the head is less or the amount of flesh, then pull back your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, you will pull back your hand with the same iron, or with another that is frozen: until the bones that I told you about are seen.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from the salt, dissolve it in water, and drink it into your mouth, and place it over the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the swallowed saliva over the spot that has been drunk, and leave it there until the scar is burned by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the Tetrapharmacian ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have said that the more the splinter remains open, the more pus is emitted: therefore it is better and more healed.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the mouth, and it should hold the cauterant until it thickens some bone density.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then the wound is made after it has been hardened from the bone, and then it is cared for.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	When others say that it is necessary to let the cauterized part touch the end, until an impression of the iron is printed on the inner side of the cheek, so that the cheek falls away in the form of a scalpel: or the instrument that women place in the temple with the letter Phi: and they consider that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the gum becomes loose for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is dressed, until it is solidified.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, I do not recognize these two kinds of cauterization at all, except in some men according to their fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to let it go, in my opinion, is better with the health of the patient.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head weakens from the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other parts: and especially when the head is weak and debilitated by nature: and the first kind of cauterization is indeed safer and better with me, and I use it: therefore, to operate with this in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	¶ About the method of cauterizing the head in the pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	¶ Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and it is prolonged in the weak, and it is used with plasters, and pins, and head remedies, and oils, and applications.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if the cauterization has already been done with the iron that we have mentioned, and it does not give anything to it from these: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is weak, but strong by nature of creation, and it is not weak, and it finds cold, then cauterize with another iron under that little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over all the skull of its own cauterization, do not pierce the skin, and do not cut through the quantity of bone that we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And he should cauterize it himself with one cauterization in the back of his head, in the place which is called the eye. And this is the place where the wound is to be made, and he should shave off your hair there, and do not break the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the infirm man finds because of that violent pain, and diverse from the pain of other cauteries of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say this Cauterization in his place: and it must be that it is the cauterization whereby the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head more gently cauterized, whereby the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of him.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	¶ Of the way of cauterizing in one-sided headache, both when the medicine is acidic, and when it is with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When the pain and heat is in the part of the head, and it extends to the eye, and the face is washed with the medicines, and the rest of the cure is given as I said in the divisions of the disease, and it does not all fit together: then the cauterization in him is of two kinds: either with an acidic medicine burning: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But when the cauterization is with an acidic medicine burning, it is like this: take one tooth, and you will make it sharp, and you will cut off the ends of it from two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then divide the place of the pain when the phlebotomy is wide, until there is a place under the skin where the tooth catches.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into the same place under the skin until it is hidden: then tighten it around it with a proper string, and let it be for fifteen hours, then dissolve the tooth, and take out the string, and let it be for two or three days, or four: then put on top of it a submerged belly in honey, until the place produces pus: then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	If you wish to do this with some of the medicines that I have written about in the twelfth book of the work on the arts of the Middle Ages, which are burned.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization, however, is done in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cauterant, which is in this form, is burned.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the Clavicle: for its form is like that of a claw, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it directly on the spot and hold your hand firmly: and you will gently roll the iron with great force: and the quantity that is burned should be according to the thickness of the skin, as in the middle of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery below is not burned and the flow of blood is impeded.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the bandage in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then place the bandage with ointment, and care for it with ointment until it is cured.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemi-headache with the second burning of the Cauterant.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And be careful not to cut the artery in this hemi-headache, properly speaking.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	In the old method of cauterization in hemi-headaches.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a hemi-headache, with what we have said earlier in the treatment of diseases, and not with the division of diseases: and you see that the disease is not sufficient to what we have said about cauterization with the first burning with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to make the Cauterant burn with the second burning, until the white line on the spot above the pain is completely healed, and its length is the middle of the digit, or as if this: and place your hand firmly, and tie it until you cut the artery, and bleed until you reach the jaw.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Indeed, it is necessary for you to prevent the continued motion of the jaw, which moves during mastication, from becoming swollen on the side, or the nerve that moves it, from causing a spasm therefrom.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is for the care and caution of the arterial blood flow that has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	In the act of severing it, there is fear, and especially him who knows not what it does, nor is eager, nor experienced: he lets the operation be performed with that first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I remain with the recollection of the regulation of the blood flow from the artery according to its own mode, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from his ailment, which is not sufficient for him to have this cauterization, and if you see the body enduring the cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have said, take care of the knee until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cauterization that we have said in the chapter of the extraction of the artery with the cauterization having two spits.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When ear pain occurs from cold, and it is treated with loosened ice, and the remaining cure that we have said in division, and the pain does not move away, then fire cauterization: and this is what is called the Point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points are made with it after its burning around the ear, as it rotates: or around the whole, if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch it with the cauterization from the root of the ear as much as you can, after you see the places with the burning: and the amount of the cauterization should be ten points in all ears, and almost like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then attend to the location until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	¶ In the method of cauterization in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture which is performed with cauterization, is none other than from those species which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And he gave a specification of the species which happens from dryness, and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you are treating this species of torture with earwax, and gargles, and your cure does not benefit, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the weakest of the three Cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and secondly a little lower than its time, and thirdly at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterization on the opposite side of the weakest part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For hardening does not happen, unless in the part which appears to be healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cauterization is that it cauterizes itself with the Cauterie in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: and another at its time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lay your hand with the Cauterie, until the quantity of the denseness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the Cauterie, and it is a species from the knife, whose form was previously mentioned: yet it is not too fine for that little, as you see: and it is necessary for it to be a knife with a superfluous bulk which is not too great.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then attend to the location with that which precedes: until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	¶ In the method of cauterization in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes antiquated, and when you treat it as we have said, and your treatment does not conform to your medication, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations over all the horns of his head, and a cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cauterization in the back of the head, according to what precedes: and the mode of cauterization should be according to what precedes.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Even it is cauterized with cauterization over the top of the stomach: and it is the lastest.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then he is treated, with what precedes.

Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that they be done in the first place on the patient who has a great gum, and the pills that cleanse the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shake the head of the patient entirely, and put on top of hisOccipital a plaster from the Synaps book described in the treatise of plasters: and put it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For it is the mode of cauterization: and do this according to the same order that I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then he is cured by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then do him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the upper part of his head to the lower part of the eye: and put between all the cauterization a thickness of the finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauterization with what precedes.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish to add something, and the patient is enduring that: then do him cauterization in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	That if you wish to add something: then cauterize him with two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him, until he is cured: let the cauterization be olive according to the form that was said before.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary to proceed with the cleansing of the head with salt and with what we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then rub the weak head: then cauterize it with cauterization in the middle of the head, and with cauterization on all parts of the head, and with cauterization on the back of the head, and with three on the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	However, if you need more than one cauterization for the softening of the body, and the weak tolerates it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four cauterizations on the back of the neck, and the last with cauterization, until it burns from the most of its skin, and tear it with your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals: and then apply ointment.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary to clean the head of his brain first with salt and with the further treatment that we have said in division, when it is weak or tolerates in acceptance of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and mouth rinses are given to clean the head of his brain before many days with good food.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then rub the head of his, then cauterize it with one cauterization in the middle of the head, according to how it precedes in the way: and with another on the back of his head, and with all parts of the crown of its cauterization.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	That if it is weak and strong, and tolerates it, then cauterize it with the cauterizations that we have said in having paralysis and softening of the body on the neck and back of the neck, and on the back of the neck: and the ointment should be according to the way that precedes.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is superfluous humors that become melancholy, and the body is a moist one, then give it power to cleanse its brain according to what precedes in division; then rase the infirm head, and afterwards make a decent tortellum out of linen, like a circle.

Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard it from all wetness, and make it sit in the bath, for a few days in fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to shave his head and burn it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him twice over two cauteries, if the descent of water is delayed in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side, if the descent of water is delayed in one eye: and cut off with the cauterization all the eyelids and arteries that are under the cheek: and let the cauterizations be long in breadth of time: and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the ancient tears of the eyes are constant: and they are above the eyelids, and the arteries that are in the manifest outside of the cheek, it is believed that this is from superfluous cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cauterization that I will narrate in the delay of water descending, with cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations over two times, and two cauterizations in wool under two bones.

And if you wish, cauterize it above two eyebrows with two cauterizations in all parts: and let them elongate by two times: and the length of the cauterization should be according to the length of the eyebrows: and do not always your hand with the cauterization tool, indeed according to the amount that inflames the third eyelid.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs of the eye become rough.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterization is in two ways: either with fire, or with the medicine burning.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	When using cauterization with fire, the attendant should warn the patient beforehand to let go of his hair, if any of them are shaving him, so that they may prolong and avoid it.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If they should prick him at his own side: then bind his eyes with a thread so that they do not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and they become inflamed, then place the weak head of the patient in your belly: then make a sign on the eyelids of his eyes with a cautery, according to the shape of the myrtle leaf: and that should be the beginning of the sign near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a draught swallowed by the patient on the albumen: or on the mucilage of silk over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then cauterize with fire, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you have gradually drawn in many wounds, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf, totally appearing properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your healing work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the hair being pulled out at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then pull your hand, and let it go three days later.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place over it the draught with honey, until the scar is removed.

And if you wish, submerge wool or cloth in cold ointment and place it over the painful tooth: and place a heated iron over it until the heat penetrates to the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	However, the cauterization of this with fire is what you should aim for to reach the iron tube or the iron tube.

Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.

When pain from coldness and moisture occurs in the head, or from too much vapor, until it escapes from its natural complexion, and is made weak by that which I have said, and does not improve: then it is necessary to let the weak part be shaved over the cauterization, and signs appear on it according to this figure, and the same quantity of this, when it is burned, above the ear, where the sweat comes from the body of man: and there should be a space between every cauterization according to the size of the finger: and the cauterization should be according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cauterization too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And the quantity that burns is from the thickness of the skin, not adding to its middle, and it is weak standing on its own feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if it is not standing, then it is lying down, which has already extended its legs, and has raised its arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cauterization.

Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care that you do not finally reach the cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is not burned all over, because the body is also burned, and it permeates the intestines: for the skin is subtle there, so you know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing epitaxis.
Caput XXX.	Head XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if it is an epitaxis of the flesh of the ear or of its covering, then if it is in the flesh of the ear, it causes a weak pain and grayness without acuteness: and if it is in the covering of the ear, with pain there is acuteness: and you now see why it has exhausted the physicians of their strength in its treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it must be that the weak part should be removed from its own covering.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the place of the epitaxis with the caustic: then the flame of the cauterizing agent that resembles the edge.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And it is cauterized with that cauterizing agent until the whole skin is burned, and then it flows into the siphon, until all the sweat has exuded: then care for the curing of the exits until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it should not be used in this manner unless the student's desire in medicine is prolonged: and by whose hand these diseases come with experimenting several times: then will he dare to try such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But I think it better to let it alone.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Head XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that the cauterizing agent with the roots of Aristolochia was applied to the cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you receive from the dry roots of Aristolochia as long as possible, one longer root than that found in it, and it should be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then dip it in oil: and burn it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize the cauterization one on that which is between the continuity of the shoulder and the neck, and with two cauterizations slightly inclined under the guide of small declivities to the part which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauterizations also in that which is between the fifth and sixth declivities to the posterior, and another one in the middle of the chest, and another one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauterizations from the posterior: one in that which is between two spatulas: and two cauterizations from the two sides of the chest, the lower cauterization which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it does not have to be that you compress your hand with the cauterization, but rather it should be in the manifest skin that smells.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient ones have said that out of humans who use cauterization from the same radiant metal: and they ignite it, and then they send it inside that which is between the ribs, until it comes to the apostema with it, and it issues sanies, as we have said in the apostema of Epatus.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cauterization is out of fear that either the weak one dies immediately, or it happens in the place of the fistula, which has not been cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	¶ About the method of cauterizing the Liver Head, XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you heal the disease of the liver, when the thing that we have said about the cure in the division of diseases does not correspond to your cure, then the cauterization is in it according to three methods, which are all right.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is that you make three cauterizations, or four lineations according to the length of the liver according to the figure of the cauteries of Epatus, which precedes the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	The size of the cauterization should be proportional to the thickness of the finger, or less if possible.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	The method of cauterization that I mentioned for the sole should also be equal in surgery.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	Do not tighten your hand with the cauterization, and make the muscle on the back of your hand weak.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method of cauterization is to use two hot irons, as mentioned in the chapter on shoulder dislocation. Elevate the skin that is in direct contact with the thigh, where the weak side of the knee is located: your elevation should be such that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body, so that they fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two heated irons gently, until they pass through the skin from the other side: then remove the cauterization tool. Therefore, four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	If you wish to cauterize with a cauterization tool that has three hot irons.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then, be careful of the cauterization tool after you let it emit pus for many days: it is more effective than the rest that have preceded it in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	¶ The method of cauterization in Hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	Head 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterization does not fall in Hydrops unless it is properly clamped.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating Hydrops with the methods of treatment that I mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not improve, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the navel, and one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, and two after the back between the vertebrae, one in direct contact with the chest, and another in direct contact with the stomach: the depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then release the open cauterization, so it releases pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not neglect the weak from curing after cauterization, as it is necessary for two intentions to gather there: and he will hurry towards cure with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of cauterization with which the belly is cauterized should be a bandage: according to the form that precedes it: and its form with which the back is cauterized, should be an ointment according to the form that precedes its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	¶ About the method of cauterizing the feet and limbs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are drenched in hydropathy and replenished with citrus water: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in nails, which is between the ear and the ring: and pull out your hand with the cauterization, and do not twist it: then pull out your hand: and do not touch it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrus water will remain, and the cauterization should be in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizations on the two legs, and let the cauterization be at the end of the lance-like cauterization: and let the cauterization be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and one below that, about in the middle of the leg: and over all the belly make two cauterizations: and release the open cauterization without cure for a long time: so that some water remains from it: then care for it with the rest that I have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	¶ About the method of cauterizing in the ventricular solution.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XLV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the ventricular solution is thawed and moistened, until the cold and wet strength becomes weak and digestive that are in the stomach and intestines: and care for it according to the methods of cure, and it does not cure: and you see a weak enduring cauterization with exudating strength, then cauterize it with a large cauterization over the stomach, according to how it precedes in the cauterization of the stomach with the ring-like cauterization, and four cauterizations around the belly with subtle cauterizations, and a cauterization with a subtle claw over the alloy above the aloes, or two cauterizations.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	If you observe the exuding moisture and the one who tolerates it well, then cauterize it with cauterization over the liver, and with cauterization over all of the thighs. And perhaps add two small cauterizations over the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	This is indeed a useful remedy, whose errors do not occur.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of treating hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When hemorrhoids are found in the anus, either many or one, and they are of large humors, cold, or corrupt humors, and are treated as we said in division, and do not agree with the cure: then cauterize them with three cauterizations over the lower back of the spine just under the ribs, roughly triangular, and a cauterization under the navel as if two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that the stomach of this person is cold, and the food does not digest, and you see his face to be pale, then cauterize him with a large cauterization over the stomach according to what precedes: and with cauterizations over the spleen of the same person, and with another over the liver, when you close the open cauterization for some time: then care for it until it recovers.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	On the method of treating an abscess after its rupture.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you rupture an abscess, then use a hot cauterization that resembles the radius.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the hot cauterization into the ruptured abscess: and your last hand until the cauterization reaches the opening of the wound, through which the blood runs: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If then the abscesses are many, then cauterize each one according to what we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for it, when it comes to that which it gives to them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cauterization over tin, it is the last in the wound.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	¶ In the manner of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the weak one does not obey the section and operation that we have told you about in its place, and is afraid of it, perhaps it may be healed with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes old, runs pus from it, and the corrupted moistures,
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is better that what should be done is to test it with thin probes.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of its penetration when tested.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat the cauterization, which is similar to the radio.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself intact into the fistula and in the quantity in which you entered, close the hole.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cauterization on it, until all the corrupted bodies burn, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity necessary to your case.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from the burning of the nerve, if there is one, or of the great wound: or if the fistula goes to the body of the urethra, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all those places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think that it is not permeable.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place is sealed, and the materials are removed from it, and there remains for a long time such a place: then you know that it is healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	If they do not discard that matter, then you know that it is permeable, or there is a corrupted opening deep within it, or perhaps this is one of them: whose remembrance will not be found in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	The method of cauterization of the Renes.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from a large amount of moisture, and it weakens because of this, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the above-mentioned membrane on the kidneys themselves, with cauterization on all the kidneys with the same cauterization, whose remembrance precedes.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize it a second time in the same membrane.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why they do not become three lined.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they will be more at the end of the incision.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	The method of cauterization of the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, until the weak urine does not hold back, then cauterize it on the lower part of the thigh above the bladder, where the hair begins to grow fine and coarse, and on the right thigh on one side and on the left on the other, and the length of the cauterization should be according to the number of the finger nail: and cauterize it with the lower cauterization on the back of the neck, or two cauterizations if you need that, and it should be according to what precedes the clamp.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The method of cauterization of the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the uterus, which prohibits conception and corrupts the menstruation of it, and delays its coming, and a pain occurs in it during the approach of the husband, then it is necessary to cauterize it with three cauterizations around the navel, as I said in the cauterization of the urethra, and on the lower back of the neck or two cauterizations, and it should be a clamp.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The method of cauterization in the case of anchylosis in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the moisture of the mucous membrane is drained to the pixel of Anchae, and a cause of its exit from its place is produced: and this is the sign that extends the crus over another, when they are compared to be inaumed: and the location of the dislocation is found to be vacuous in that place.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the weak part with the same cauterization around the pixel of Anchae: after which you see the signs when you encaust the circumference of the pixels, just as it rolls: and it falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And the cauterization that precedes in the cauterization of the stomach should be the cauterization.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cauterization is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, with a large olive cauterization: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The method of cauterization in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When there is pain in the pixel of Anchae, and the cause of that cold and moisture is, and the weak one is cared for with that which we said in the division, and it does not agree with the treatment, and it becomes old: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak one from the thick humors with pills stinking, or with artificial pills, and such as these.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	The method of cauterization in this is according to two methods: either with the cauterization when the medicines are being applied, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	When one is, it cauterizes on a piece of bone of the same kind, three times with triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And give them good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be space that is between all the cauteries of the size of a finger tip, and it should be an olive-shaped one.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	But when the cauterie is made in the middle on the head of the same bone.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes in the cauterization of the dislocation of the bone, one: so that the circle encompasses the whole bone.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin of the whole body.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is attached to the bone of the same kind, and does not extend to the hip and thigh.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the hip and thigh, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, on the place where the weak one indicates, in which there is pain, and your cauterie on the cilium of four fingers to the part that is slightly slimy, and it should be a punch.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cauterie should be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the weak one indicates that the pain extends to the toes, then cauterize it wherever the weak one indicates with the point of the cauterie, three or four or more, if he wants that.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee and the thigh, then cauterize it wherever the weak one indicates with the punch.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauteries that you do not finally with the cauterie to this that you burn the nerves, or a large artery, and draw through this on the weak one harmful evil, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	Indeed, I have seen one and another of them, who have cauterized above the ankle, and continued the cauterization, and the thigh has become inflamed until the tumor follows the foot, and the whole sole is perforated, and the whole foot is corrupted. Then a discharge of the effusion occurs, and death follows afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If pain is in two parts at once, cauterize both according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	Indeed, some wise men have said that the method of this cauterization is for the anchaea.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make like this with a piece of iron, whose diameter is half the size of the palm: and it should be at the orifice of its own according to the size of the nail of the finger, or less perhaps: and within that iron piece there should be another piece of iron.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there should be a space between all the iron pieces according to the quantity of the nail of the finger: and they should be open from two parts: and their height should be like a node, or two nodes: and make for them manubrium of iron appropriate in the iron pieces.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.

Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says that in this kind of cauterization for the children, we have not used it much because of the fear of its appearance, and therefore, because a few have found that they wait on top of it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Indeed, it is from good cauterizations that he finds a place for him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	When the cauterization is applied with the medicines, as you will do two pieces of two-holed iron rings, through which his door descends from the air or iron, and their length is equal to the wall's: of whose height there are two knots, or rather they seem to be.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be space between the two quantities of the size of the finger, and they should be open below and above: and they should hold together to be inserted, according to this form.

Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is heated with fire almost, and hold it in the amount of hours: and the weak one will endure the mordication of his and its own burning, because he has found the mordication as a fire, until the mordication ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then uncover your hand with the instrument, and withdraw hot water from the wide whole with sweet water: then let it be three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And put on top of it butter, until the blackness of the burning is removed: and let it be some days, and the pus will run from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the final in dressing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the house or crush, make for him a stand in it that contains water, according to what you made in the wide equal.

Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Sum the alkaline and unburnt lime, and take one part of them: grind both, and put them into a new crucible, whose lower part has a hole of one small size, according to the quantity that enters the radius: then put another empty crucible under the first one: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both with your thumb: then compress them with your good hand: and let the crucible go until the sharp lower part of the other crucible descends.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water, and pour it over the other lime: and dry it, until it dries out.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It will then be strong and sharp, which is given in many medical operations and in cauterization of other parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the operation of its own fire.

Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it was not necessary for another treatment, and that it was cured by one drink, until he told it, because perhaps he himself had entered the bath and left already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is good to take from the girl's tears: and if it is not found in her tears, then take the fresh milk, with a little fat, and put it on the anchae, where the pain, or swelling, or in the thigh, and let it lie for three hours, or according to the amount that she feels the austere sedation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the abdomen of the body becomes hard, then insert it into the belly.

Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning and you wish to hold it: then cauterize it with the circular cauterization around it, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last cauterization in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not see that, for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have already seen that several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with the circle, as I have said, or with many cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	§ Method of cauterization in abscesses.
Caput LIII.	Head LIV.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess and it is slow to mature, or because of the excessive making of it, or because of the weakness of age, when there are few drops of blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the abscess: then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to make a hole in it with the cauterization, then burn the cauterization with the fire of which this is the form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	I place it in the middle of Adubalat, until it penetrates the skin: and let it be a cauterizing agent from it that follows the weak one, so that the course may be pure.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	¶ Method of cauterization in the corrupting one.
Caput LIIII.	Head LXXXIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	The corrupting one is not but a corrupting in the walking member, and it corrupts itself: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If then you see the corrupting one in the place where the cauterization endures with fire, then much cauterization, small wounds and great wounds, according to which is in that place where the corrupting one is, will be.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until the total corruption is eradicated, and nothing remains deeply from it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then release it after three days, and put on the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil, until all eschars are eradicated and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of it with the unguents that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If then you see that after three days healthy flesh is generated without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization on that which remains from the places of corruption.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrupting one is treated sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises from the place of cauterization itself.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, the cauterization with fire is more profitable of the medication: and I have already said the cauterization of it with sharp medicine in division: take then it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	¶ Method of cauterization in the scrofula and the warts.
Caput LV.	Head LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often affects the lower parts of the foot: it is a large, sieved, thing that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	Indeed, there is cautery in these parts according to two modes: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However, when it is with fire, it is like a feather made of flame: which is made of iron, according to the quantity that contains it closed from all sides: and it should be of a fine edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the burning one on the closed part.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then roll the hand with the cautery around the closed part, until the cautery reaches the depth of the closed part: and let it remain for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply the plaster with thin ointment, and rough salt: and let it be applied at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with the generated unguent of flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not cured, and there are many of them, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then apply the cautery with hot water to them: and it is like taking a canula from air, or iron, or from feather-like wings: and place it on the closed part, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then take out a small amount of water from the hot water: keep your hand, and roll it with the compression of your hand, until it impresses the margin of the canula on the closed part, and finds hot water at the depth, to the root: and wait for the weak one for a short time after the heat of the water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let it be, for the closed part is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do it one by one with one after another until you touch all those who are in the body from them.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been removed, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	¶ In the method of cauterization in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Head LVII.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that Tremor is from cold in the nerve, or from the fever of the fourth, or otherwise: then it is necessary for him to be cauterized with four cauteries, or five on the back of the spine, and throughout all the spine, and in the chest of his stomach, and over his stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For Tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and hastens the health of the sickness of coldness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	¶ In the method of cauterization of Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Head LVIII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When the Albathir impurities that are formed from the gross materials are expelled from the body, it is called Albathir impurities.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it is necessary to first, when they appear, that they be cauterized over the entire head with a fine olive oil cauterization on the myrtle wood whose ends are burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or if the long roots of Aristolochia are used.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or if the lentil cauterization is used.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized for the removal of adenoids, in the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase: and it tears off the surplus making them, and they heal from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after bloodletting when euacuation has occurred.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	¶ In the method of cauterization in the flow of blood from an artery to the ulnar.
Caput LVIII.	Head 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that blood flows out of an artery that has been cut at the elbow, which happens externally, or at the site of a cut with stakes, or a cauterization of the member, and such as these: and it is difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to someone, then with your hand quickly approach the orifice of the artery, and place your thumb on it: and tightly tie it until the blood is pressed under your thumb and does not flow out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place the small olive-oil cauterization on fire and a larger number of them: and blow on them until they are burned well.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, whether small or large, according to the elbow and the place where the artery is disrupted, and place the cauterization on the wound, after which you quickly remove your thumb: and hold the cauterization until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with your finger from the orifice of the artery and extinguished by the cauterization, then take another cauterization quickly, from the cauterizations that are prepared in fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the tendon that is there, and another evil may happen above it.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you know that when blood flows out of the artery, it is not possible to cut it off at that time: especially if the artery is large, unless with one four-hundredth part.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or if with cauterization, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when the extraction is not made.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is drawn out, the extremities of it contract and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	It is said that with the strong binding of philosophy.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	They are said to be placed above the property of medicine that can cut blood and string around with a proper constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, he who administers the cutting of it with the binding and the stricture with cloth, or the position of things burning, and similar, does not give it a severe blow, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If however something happens to someone of this kind, and there is no present physician nor medicine, then he should start with the position of the index finger over the hole of the wound, as we have said, and a proper constriction, until blood is collected from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, with ice-cold water constantly poured over it, until the blood congeals and becomes hardened, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, he should consider what he needs from cauterization, or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	About the incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar ones.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	I have already mentioned in Chapter One, all the diseases in which it is suitable to use the cauterization and burning fire, and the occasions for them, their causes, and the tools used for them, and the forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed this chapter from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter, as it should be: so that it may appear above the one who is asking for it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I start this, it is necessary that you add to your sons that there is something in this chapter that is feared from the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Because of this, caution is required, for it often happens that venous flow accompanies the operation in this chapter, which is dangerous to the eye, whether it be from an incision on the cheek, or an extraction of a tooth, or an opening for a wound, or a cutting for a stone, or an incision on a stone, and similar operations. For in all these there is trembling and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not let that which is uncertain fall on you, for sometimes it falls to men in this art with the weak.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For it is from those who are angry with their sickness, and death is near to them, because of their quickness which they find from their infirmity and its length.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when sickness is from fear, which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And it is from those who give their slave to you, and says to you with him, hoping for health, and his sickness is dangerous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it does not need to be that you consent to him who comes to you from those whose method is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let our caution be greater than our desire and greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume on anything from him, unless after certain knowledge, which proves to you that this has a successful consequence.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the care of all your sick, by prophecy and indication to that which is convenient for health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that there is an assistant to you for the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, of his understanding, and may he not take away from you the direction and inspiration, for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	I myself do indeed order this chapter to be divided into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter of cauterization, from the hair to the feet: so that it may become clear to you what you want to take from it and where you lack it.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ Regarding the treatment of water that is collected in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Caput I. (This is a heading, not a translation.)
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	¶ You know that this affliction often occurs in children during childbirth: either when the woman tightly grips the head of the child without causing any pain.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	¶ And whenever it also happens from an unknown cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	¶ I myself have not seen this affliction in others than in children: and for all whom I saw die from it, I have therefore decided to abandon the operation in this case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	¶ I have seen a child whose head was full of water, and his head was swollen throughout the day until he could not sit on himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	¶ This indeed moisture, is gathered between the skin and the face: or it gathers under the bones above the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	¶ And the operation in him, if there is moisture between the skin and the face, and the aperture is small, then it is necessary to make one opening in the middle of the head in length: and the length of the fissure is almost two nodes, until the moisture flows.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	¶ And this is a flat shape.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	¶ If then the moisture is more increased, and the aperture is larger, then place them two openings according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	¶ And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see openings in the head from all sides: and the water is drawn out when you compress it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you this: then it is necessary to make three openings in the middle of the head according to this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	After making an incision, remove all moisture completely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tightly stitch the wounds with lint and cotton threads.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a poultice of wine and oil up to the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and care for the elbow with splints and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let the head be tightly tied with equal force.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And drink only small amounts of dry food until the member is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	The method of another incision is such that you consider where the large apoplexy appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is in the back, or in the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with the incision where it appears to you the apoplexy and the filling of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, do not rupture the artery, and let there be a flow of blood, and the weak one dies from that flow with the discharge of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ About the incision of the arteries which are after the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a cataract happens to someone's eyes or heart, and it becomes old and does not respond to the treatment of physicians: then the last treatment is in that, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you need to cut them, it should be such that the weak head of his own radiates.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then tighten the weak neck of his own with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the heart beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	The locations of both ears are those that are behind the depressed ears: and they are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then the signs with wax are placed on both: and cut through both with a sharp knife, with the incision being directed towards the nose, and it is made to go through the width of the head. And so it should be.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the knife under the artery, and cut it towards the upper part with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision should be as if joined by two fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when it is cut, blood will flow out of the wound, which bubbles up with a sudden jump, frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure the distance from the ear with a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then the signs with wax are placed, and find until the nose.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which should be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will emit more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	The whole of this according to the amount that appears to you from the weak vein and the overflow of the artery of it.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the elbow.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains from the nose to the elbow something, then cut it, so that the hot aposteme does not happen: then tie the elbow with ribbons from the linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	¶ Regarding the extraction of arteries that are in temporaries.
Caput III.	Chapter Three.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man with an old hemicranea, or acute cataract due to the sharpness of the acrid and hot humors in the thumbs of the temporaries, or old soda, uveal, and such like, and is treated according to the ways of the curing medicine, and it does not agree with this: then we have learned in these diseases the extraction of arteries from the temporaries, or cauterization of them, as we have mentioned.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	The method of operation for their removal is such that it plucks the weak hairs that are in the time, and intends to the apparent artery in the time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	Indeed, it is shown to you by its own pulsation, and is rarely hidden except in a few humans, or extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then it will pull the weak head of its own with any cloth of its own: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or, if you wish, you can rub the place with hot water until it appears to you with a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take sea-salt, which I formed a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrub the skin with it until the ulcers reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then remove the wool from it and pull it out to the upper part, until you pull it out from the skin, and make it drip out of the clothes that are under it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then cover it with the end of the wool.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut off from it a part according to the quantity by which its ends elongate and contract, and do not allow a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut off, and if it is not cut off, the blood does not ascend deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then let the blood drip out of the blood until it reaches .III.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong thread made of fine thread, or of threads from aloe, so that it does not reach the putrefaction before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that time, or at another later hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with cauterization up to the mouth, as with a kitchen cauterization: until the extremities of its sides are applied, and it will remain in the same place of that operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	It is better to do this, unless he has a fever or his complexion is hot.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For cauterization is from them which are used to dry out moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to be dried out.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it should be filled with the old cloth after the artery extraction, and the appropriate pillows should be placed above it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution is made with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with linen, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if in the meantime while operating, blood flows from the artery, then immediately proceed to cut it with cauterization, or until it fills the place with a bandage: and tighten your hand until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of these is present to you, then place your thumb above the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And rub the place with cold water until the sharpness is quiet and tightens according to what is appropriate.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And since that which is leucine and easier to extract the artery is, it is, to cauterize a wound with this cauterization having two kitchen knives: and the sharpness of the two knives should be similar to that of an arrow.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like two knives, then it should be cold to both: and flesh will not come with violence.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When there is any roughness in them, fire heat is to be applied, and the flesh is quickly removed: for this work is better than all others, and more easily done, and more profitable.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a margin between the two handles, as the breadth of the finger between the two places where you have burned with encaustic: and place the burnt ends in both places, until they reach the end, and let them touch the bone at two places: so that it may extend between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not become solid with this cauterization.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Regarding the care of the course of sharp, frequent tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are frequent and flow from the eyes which are outside the craneum of the head: and nothing of the cure of medicine is found in them with other medicines, and you see the face of the weak one to be red, and she feels her walking on her front as the walking of ants: and her eyes are drooping, moist, so that her eyebrows are already corroded with corrosion: and her eyelids are burned out from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this cure for it, and called it the operation of Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as if the weak one were to be shaved on her front.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in her face, equally distant from the length of the face: and let the length of the incision be almost as long as two fingers, and let the second incision be equidistant from the middle of the nose in the middle of the face, and the third according to the movement of the fingers, and the third from the other part: and be careful not to cut any arteries which are in the two sides: and stretch your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let there be a space of all the quantity of three fingers connected: and let there be for you a piece of sponge ready, or many drying rags, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the two sharp ends of the sponge, whose next form is as follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	After the incision which is on the side of the temple, until the second incision: and it will exfoliate the entire skin that is between the two incisions, when you sift, which is above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this also from the middle incision until the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this sponge, and insert the other instrument into the first incision again, which is called the sharp lancet, from one part gently, not sharply from the other part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of its flank against the flesh turned out with the skin, and the other side gently against the eye: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut off all the moisture that comes down from the hair to the eyes, except for what is continuous with the incision up to the one that appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this until the middle fissure to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after it runs out of blood in equal quantity, express the spots from the points of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place linen strips in all the fissures, and put above them wet cloths soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see if a fever does not occur hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the bandage, and give a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it from the ointment of balsam, and the rest which are used to heal wounds, until it is cured.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ About the care of sharp lachrymal and catarrhal discharge to the eyes from the inside of the head.
Caput V.	Head Five
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp cataracts occur in someone, they are often small and persistent. You notice the eyes looking dim and weak. The eyelids may be swollen, and hair falls out from them. There is severe pain and discomfort in the deep part of the head, with a sensation of something stuck in the eye. At this point, take note of which of these symptoms are not due to the cataract itself, but rather to the many teeth.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	This is a better treatment for them.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	It is best to have the sick person grind the front of their head.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or another one nearby, and start from the left temple to the right temple. The incision should go all the way to the eye: and extend your hand to the fingers that move during chewing: until when the eye is held: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two incisions between the old cloth or linen threads.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie it up from below with pulleys: and soak the pulleys with wine and oil, so that a hot aposteme does not happen.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you untie it, and see that the hot aposteme is about to happen: then it is necessary to press the eye, until flesh begins to be born in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of it with the regimen that causes flesh to be born, just as if you were taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colocynth: and prepare a plaster from them and apply it to the birth of the flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	¶ About the care that falls under Aurum.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls upon the eye is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or one similar to stone, such as iron and gold: or it is of plant origin, such as chestnut and flax: or it is a flowable substance, such as water, vinegar, and their likes: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When a stone falls on the eye, or a kind of stone not added to it, and does not grow in gold, expose the gold alone: if then you see a stone, at that time distill something from olive oil, or use this.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make it bubble with condiment, and stuff the nostrils with the approach of the sneeze, after which you place in the circumference of the ear, either threads of cloth or wool, and extend the ear to the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For many times it goes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with Gestion, that is, Pizigarolis subtle, whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it goes out with Gestion, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a small amount of unguentum caedi subtle, duplicated.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If then it does not go out with this, then make a cannula of air, and insert the extremity of the cannula into the opening of the ear greatly, and stuff what is in the circumference of the cannula with softened ointment with a blunt forceps, so that it does not drip except from the cannula: then draw it out with a strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times it goes out with what we have mentioned.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If then it does not go out in this way: then take from the helkalimbat, or from the husk, that is, prepared flour with which they take the seeds, a moderate amount: and put it at the extremity of the radius after you have placed a comfortable cut on it: then insert it into the opening of the ear with ease, after which you dry the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If then he does not proceed with all that we have mentioned, then immediately before cutting, before the hot application comes or the spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of incision is, to first take out the weak phlebotomy from the head: and then take it out from blood according to its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit down between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small incision at the root of his ear near the fatty part on the lower side of himself: and let the incision be in the shape of the moon, until it reaches the stone: then take it out with it, which is possible from the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then make the incision from your hole with its weakness, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If that which is falling into the ear is from one grain of wheat which are growing and swelling: then give it its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If however it does not obey you to the end: then take a thin, subtle sponge, according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And give it with it the abscission of that kind from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not make this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you put it on many chips: then take it out with tweezers, or with a subtle hand, or with suction, as we said, for the extraction of its is wet.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water which is entering into the ear, it is necessary that the weak one should use its sniffing with the condyle at first: and it has filled its own ear with some old one: and it is lying on top of that ear, in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he proceeds through this, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	If not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin ones, soft ones, and heat them slightly with fire, and insert one of the weaker ones into its ear hole: and it will salivate on its foot one from that part, and strike with a stone another on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, it will not cease to do this with stones and stones, until it has entirely gone out of water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And it will have gone out of water so that you can take one from the parpyro, or from the lobe, and insert the end of it into its ear: and light the other end with fire until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another lobe, and do this many times until it has entirely gone out of water: and remove the same with a cannula according to what was previously placed on the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal that is entering into it, if it is a small body like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I have said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the senses: then give the extraction of its with care, and uncini: and this is easier for all that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of an ovum generated in the ear, when you are caring for it with what I have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and it does not fit your care: then it is necessary to look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If something appears there from the ovum: then remove it with care, or with fine uncini.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however something does not appear there from the ovum: then take a cannula whose form is this, strict below, and wide above: and insert the subtle end of it into the ear according to the quantity that the weak one can bear: and then suck with that strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Perform this frequently until all worms exit.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	However, if they do not obey you to the end, then surround the cannula with a cork, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not exit with what I said: then administer the distillations that the ancients have already found in the interference of worms: and you will find this in the book of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And may your flow be like when you pour olive oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it like you want, either of silver or air, lower and stricter, in which there is a small hole above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	It should be that which is pushing in the connection of the cannula, to be made of air.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take the radium and wrap the end of its cloak around it in a proper way: then pour oil, or honey, or what you want from these medicines into the cannula, and it should be in the ear: then insert the radium with the cloak below, and express it with your compressed hand until the oil is pushed through the connection heard, and feels weak inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be already heated with fire as much as possible: and take care that nothing freezing is poured into it, for medicines do not tolerate that:
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	¶ About the treatment of the accidents of gold care.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants come out of the wombs of their mothers unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people poverty in the ear hole, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this poverty sometimes happens in a deep ear hole, which does not follow the use: and sometimes it happens to the outer hole, and follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which happens deep in the ear, and which is not comprehensible by sight, is difficult to cure in many positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows, use should be made of the weak ear in the sun, and look at it: then if you see an appearance of opulation, open it with gentle suds, whose form is this which follows, which is the extremity of its being in which there is some small latitude, whose some part is sharp: and the rest of the suds is of two sides, soft: so as it will not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then opilation is from the flesh of the ear: then hold it with a thin file, and shave it with ease of strength, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If then opilation is deep in the ear: then take a thin, gentle iron, and heat it slightly: and then throw it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel opilation with that which is found weak with age of the hearing, try to open it with ease: and beware of wounding the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a linen according to the size of the hole which you have made in the unguent of Egypt: do this for a few days until you are secure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take linen and pour it into hot water, and rub on it ground oatmeal, and use that itself.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If then you see the ear already swollen: then it is necessary to take out the linen and allow it with another linen that has been in oil rosace, until the swelling is hot: and then care for it until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, there is a sudden flow of blood: then submerge a sponge, or pieces of cloth in cold water, and place your ear over it: and continue the remaining treatment, which excludes the flow of blood mentioned above, in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	¶ Regarding the care of Altheli's eyes.
Caput VIII.	Head VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Altheli which occur in the eyelid, are sometimes wet and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with tweezers, or with a needle, and to scrape them off with soap from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place it over the shaved areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If, however, blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine-pointed cauterizing iron.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many of them return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	¶ Regarding the care of Grandin's eyes.
Caput IX.	Head IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something similar to Grandin occurs in the eyelids, which is of the same firmness and hardness as his, and is therefore called Grando: it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider at that time if Grando is proceeding from it, which appears on the eyelid, and they are all bent towards every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, find under it a fissure through its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from all sides with ease until it becomes smooth.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a thorn, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	However, if the cut is not prepared for you, unless you pierce the eyelid with the incision almost at once, it will harm that weak one in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large: then gather it with the suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not harm you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment will restore it and make it fat.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if a hailstone is directed to the inner part of the ear, then the inner eyelid, and suspend the hailstone with a thorn: besides which you need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	And if the eyelid is stretched by the incision, it will not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash out the eye after the hailstone incision, with salt water: and take care of the place where it is fat, until the weak one heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ About the care of Axiynath's eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a wax that is generated in the upper eyelids: and it happens most of all to boys: and it grieves their eyes, and cataracts happen to them in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because the tears come to them, and for that reason they should lie down on their faces at all times, and sleep on them, and their eyelids are always wet, and they are swollen with inflation: and the appearance of Axirnath is prominent in the eye, and when you take a place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The method of performing this operation is for the infirm person to place their own weak head in your groove.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen bandage and prepare a braid from it, and make a circle of that braid according to the amount contained in Axlath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that Axlath is aggregated in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find the middle of its moisture with sandpaper, and there should not be a fissure larger than that made in bloodletting in the deep part.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it may be necessary to find the entire skin, until the wounds come to Axlath from many dispositions of Axlath from the fissure according to the form of white flax.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then take it out with the linen cloth that you have injected between your fingers to the outside: and turn your hand to the right and left until it is discharged: and be careful not to add to the fissure so that there are not wounds with sandpaper to the eye, and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if Axlath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, add a little with ease to the fissure until Axlath comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then take it out as I have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the linen cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and tie it with threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And among men there are those who say that salt is, and they place it in the moisture of the fissure so that what remains of that moisture becomes liquid.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if it happens to the place of an aposteme hot, then take care of it with sedative ointments until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Methods of making the eyes dull, that is, when the eyelid is softened, whereby it becomes as if it should blush unnecessarily.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs are added to the eyelids of the eyes before they reach their full growth and become thicker than natural hairs, they become harmful to the eye and cause various diseases such as excessive tearing, softening of the eyelids, and cataracts until this becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And making the eyes dull is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, according to what was said earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or making the eyes dull is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with cannulas, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the weak head in the sinus of your arm.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle in it, where the thread of the eyelid is from the lower part, and make the needle go through the thread with a thin wire, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and take the thread up with the eyelid and turn it with your thumb.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid, where the hairs added to it are under the hairs, from the largest tear to the smallest tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread and place a small piece of wool or cloth under the eyelid, and then draw a figure on the eyelid with a candle, which is like the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	Indeed, it must be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, for that has already diversified among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For these, it is required that the amount is made to fit within the eyelid, according to the quantity which is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, when you find the salve on the two lines you have marked, and begin with the larger tear and go to the smaller tear, and there should be a single fissure near the natural hair, as is the breadth of the rays.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then, insert an awl into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then, scrape off the entire skin.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then, bring the two lips together with a stitch, using a needle and fine thread: and wipe away the blood, and make what is superfluous stick to the threads which are above the two eyebrows, with which some things may adhere, if you wish to do that; and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then, release the stitch and thread up to three or four days, or later care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, release the flap without stitching, and care for it with it, which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid swells at the wound and its gathering, but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This is the way the ancients taught to cure Ataxir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Indeed, there is anxiety about the weakest in it, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another mode in Ataxir as well: and it is that the signs are made on the eyelid, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have mentioned.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then, swell the eyelid with three awls separated or gathered according to this form which follows, and then cut off what is superfluous with small gashes, according to this form, with equal cutting.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold a needle, and it does not suit you: then take an acupuncture point where the thread is, and insert the acupuncture point in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread, slightly larger than the tear, and another thread, slightly smaller than the tear: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then make your hand equal by shaving: and shave the skin over which the stitch was made, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather the two lips of the wound with the suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If it happens to be a stitch at your incision or cut: let the stitch lie on the post-operative aphrosite with its point down, and these similar ones, resting on ointment.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens that the eyelids also turn the hairs of his eyes.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary for you to say in it what we have said in the incision, but the suture is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ About the care of Ataxirim with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is that you cut the eyelids, and open the fissure that was torn, according to what we have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two canes or two thin woods artificially: and the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of its parts should be less than the width of the satin: and you have already reached the ends where you hold the threads from both sides.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather both with fine threads on that which is excessive from the eyelid of the eye, and tighten two canes from both sides with a strong constraint, and let it be for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is killed, and it becomes thin, and putrid, until it falls by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is slow, then cut it with the scalpel.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then the eye is closed, let the eyelid be raised: and they shall not prick the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two cinnamon leaves, which face is made according to this figure, and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	¶ About the excision of the hairs that prick in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in that is, take a fine needle, and thrust into it a thread from fine silk, gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather the ends, and nodes of both, and make them with a fine needle gently: and let the length of the threads be a thumb's breadth.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then make in Alinxotati the thread another fine one under it in a short way, and if you will nodes of its ends.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then lay his weak head in your side, and let it be near the sun, because it is a subtle or little operation: for it is an operation of small or fine threads.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then thrust the needle with Alinxotati into the root of the eye, and make it pierce the eye quickly, until it has pushed out the natural hair outside.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the hair upwards by Alinxotati: and thrust into Alinxotati the hair: if it be one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it, until the hair has slipped out with Alinxotati in the eye with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If then Alinxotati is drawn, and the hair does not slip out with it: draw Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have composed in it, until it has slipped out of the upper hole, and see the eye by this vision: for then draw Alinxotati and the thread: and take out both, and close the eye, and let it be opened again after two or three days, until the hair grows back to its place, and the flesh is raised over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is small, then associate it with a long hair from natural hairs and pluck it together with it: or release it until it grows after some time, and then pluck it then.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Regarding the care of Alxatrati which happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, it is accidental and is formed from the consolidation of a wound, or from sections, or from cauterization, and such like.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of the operation on this is to find that consolidation, and to separate its lips, and put in it that which is between them of linen, and tie it up until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary for you to use things that dry and constrict in the treatment of this: for if you do, Alxatrati becomes worse than it was: indeed use things that soften, such as Greek hay: and embrocate with water, in which althea is boiled, and the linseed is added: and unguent dyaquilon, which is melted with some oil: and cover with it the linen, and care for it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	The treasure of your treatment is that you may overcome all ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate according to its original form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which I mentioned is not anything else but a correction of Alxatrati, so that it does not remain in the form according to which it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the care of Alxatrati which happens in the lower eyelid, and is a rugation or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Head XIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This which follows is what is properly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	It is natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental is made from the elbow, or a fissure, or cauterization, and similar to these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And one of the operations in it is, as you take a needle, in which there is a thread double, and dip it in the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread enters at the two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh with the needle towards the upper parts, and cut it with a slight edge to the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is fitting, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the radium, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and find two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and they are the extremities of the two angles of the incision, until they come together and make an angle: until when they aggregate, make this figure, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the quantity which is the side of its sharp lower part, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then aggregate the separated parts: tie it with wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with those which we said, with the softening drugs and linctuses, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Alxatrati happens from a fissure, and suture, or cauterization: then it is necessary to find the flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelid, even according to what precedes.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the tissue between the two lips according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the main point of the care of Alxatratus, when it is to be done above or below, is that the operation should be performed according to the form of Alxatratus.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, there are many varieties in the form: and the skilled artisan prepares the ingenuity with whatever method is possible for it, until he returns the figure to the natural form, or nearly so, and himself is also weak, according to what suits him from the operation and the instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	¶ About the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens in many people, so that the eyelid becomes firm with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the end of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a finger: then touch the adhesion with very fine sudor, which is not with the sharpness of the sudor its own, but is rather dull, so that the weak one does not tremble during the operation, and the sudor removes it, and hurts the eye with its sharpness: and your cut should be as if you were peeling off this adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and heals the adhesion completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour in salted water into the eye, when you have cleaned it: or distill water into it from the saline made, from the zinc dissolved with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread: and place over the eye a fattened wool with white of egg: and use saline the third day, and when it is solidified, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	De incisione unguli et eminenti carnis lachrymarum.
Caput XVI.	Caput XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that a toe has two kinds.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or is nerveless: and is like the hardness of a hoof, the fineness of silk.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or is not nerveless, like the hardness of frozen white: which when it touches the skin of a hand, or the edge of a sword, it is easily cut, and does not leave a mark of the uncino.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And neither of these kinds begin until the tears are greater, until they gradually increase, until they overcome the light and stop the motion of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the manner of operating in this incision is: to lay his weak head in your groove.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift up his eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then close the toe with a few turns of the uncino, and extend it to the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a thorn from a horse's mane, and insert it into the toe, and either the beard or the hair: and let the thread be strong, and doubly at the end of the thorn, and thrust it into the middle of the toe: and draw it out with the thread, and tie the toe with the thread, and extend it to the upper part: and pluck out with the hair the side of the toe that follows the pupil, as if you were pulling it with your hair up to the end of its tail.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part in the root of the tearful bone with fine sand, or with small furrows: and release the natural flesh of the tearful, so that it does not happen from the incision of its constant course of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the toe is extended with the sole: or with thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then, the skin is scraped gently with a soft brush, like this one.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And let it not touch the fabric with the brush, lest it pierce the skin and cause a rupture, and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, apply something salted and bruised to the eye, or made from boiled honey, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then, take care of it with what is necessary, until it is cured.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the callus is not rough and cannot be inserted into it with a knife, nor does it form a hollow in it, then this kind of callus is treated with many remedies and cured as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to make an incision in it, then open the weak eye, and take a soft, gentle brush, weak in cutting ability, according to this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the callus with a rasp on the side, with gentleness and subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is being thinned and cut, and pressed into it with a rasp, then distill a portion of your salve from the hour into the eye, made from boiled honey, or red honey, or salted and ground: and apply it to the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then, repeat this operation until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is something opposite to your benefit in the eye, hot apostem: then let it go, and take care of the apostem, until it is cured.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then, repeat this operation over the same with the rasp, until it is cured.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the flesh of the tear duct is injurious to the eye, it should be suspended with a pin, and an incision made in that part of it: and not always an incision, so that the course of the tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then take a drop of blood from the red tear, or make it from ginger, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ About the cutting of Alguadencio, and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes a red flesh is born in certain eyes of men, which is either composed or laid upon, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or draws the eyelids together, and may perhaps turn the eyelids outside: and resembles the rose of Aesculapius.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation is also such that the weak head is placed in the fold of your belly.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open the eyes of that one, and take that whole flesh with convenient ropes, and hold it with a hook one, or grasp it.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh at first, until it is all cut with the knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful not to cut it at the eye, so as not to harm it during the operation: and let your cut be the one you make, or with sandpaper that we have spoken about in the cutting of the toe: or with needles, according to what form it has after this stitch.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cut is completed, and the whole Alguadencio is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distill some red girl blood, and similar ones from corrosive medicines: and put on top of the deformed eye a cotton with the bone of the eye: so that it is secure from the heat of the stitch.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains of Alguadencio, and hot blood dominates over you, and you fear the heat of the stitch: then release the eye, and take care of it with what soothes the heat of the stitch.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then proceed over it with the operation, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly, make with the flesh added that happens in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that the treatment of all weak eyes be done with iron, either from natural causes or accidental ones, and you should not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that this member is enduring that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ Regarding the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red and are woven over the eye, and they prevent its own operation from being done: and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you at first to consider whether the eye in which Sebel is, is strong, and there is no disease in it except Sebel: then collect Sebel from that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary to place the weak one head down in your own belly.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those eyes with a thin nail one, or two according to your prudence: and the nail should be of a subtle duplication of this form, or the two nails should be graduated in the body one, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect with fine threads those eyes with fine threads, and abstain from the blood of hour to hour, until you see that these eyes are withdrawn from the eye, and they become flexible: and be careful not to hurt the eye with the sharp ends.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And your operation should be in the noon before the sun, and you should be strong in your operation, so that you do not fail except those eyes.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have filled it, then distill into the eye greenish blue, or red: so that its own acuteness may consume what remains of Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If you are unable to gather the entire thing at once in that hour, then apply an ointment to the eye with it, which soothes the pain of the eye: and let it be for a few days until the pain of it settles down: and protect it from hot application: then repeat over it according to the same manner, until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the thorn.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	¶ Regarding the reduction of Arissas to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Head XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The physicians name Arissas the fistula, which they treat with cauterization, or with burning medicine, according to what is preceeded in his narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no genius in it: unless you find on the edge of its birth, and take out all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until it is clean.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When you see the cleanness of the bone, and there is corruption or blackening, then scrape it with the instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the rough head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make of iron a nail, and let its head be round like an azir, which is punctuated with the line of the lime, or with the line of the aliskilfer, in a subtle line: and place it on the place of the corrupted bones.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption is already clean, and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with the ointments of the excised stitches.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the place is consolidated, and flesh is born in it, and the course of the exudation is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and does not return, and does not burn, and does not happen to it any accident: then you know that it is healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	If not, then there is no genius in him, unless he can reduce the fistula to the nostril, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you remove the bone secondly with a hammer, or with a sharp needle: and when the tooth is detected, then take the chisel according to this form, it should have a sharp end, triangular: and the wood of it should be a pyramid extinguished up to its end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place this over the tooth itself: and it should be near the tear duct: and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then roll your hand with the chisel, until it penetrates the tooth, and feels it weak: by this that he finds the watery humor to come out of it, when he holds his hand over his own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with stinking ointments, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When the flesh is born and the place hardens: then the material that was poured out to the outside returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter over the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On reducing the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye projects with all its parts, and there is no harm in use, nor diminution: then it is necessary to loosen the weak one: then make a bloodletting on it: afterwards put watery ointments on the skin without scraping, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and balsam, and sarcocolla on the eye.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tie the eye tightly over the plaster with many thongs.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the way of the threads is: to take many soft cloths, and double each of them over four times: make many of them: then place them one on top of the other according to the amount that the eye requires: then tie them tightly with a strong cord.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat ventosas with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then withdraw the ventosas, and release the closed eye both day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the bandage is again softened, then it should be tied tightly: afterwards, withdraw the bandage after the day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If then you see the eye already red by the wet bandage, that is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and ointment, and closed eye, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	¶ Of cutting the wet bandage.
Caput XXI.	Head XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the wet bandage, then it should be cut out and it proceeds outside the eyelid like a grain of wheat, and spoils the appearance of the man because of this, and it is said to stick in: then the operation is performed on it as I will describe: and it is, as I say, that you insert an acum into the root of the wet bandage from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another acum into it where the thread is double from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and release the first according to its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut out the place of the double thread, and tie it with that part of the wet bandage around the acum: and tie it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the acum, and place a moistened sponge on the inner side of the eyeball: and release it until the thread of the wet bandage falls.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with that which strengthens it until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when it is tied around all parts with a circle from the cloth, until it adds great prominence to the eye.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it should be scraped with a soft soap that penetrates deep into the eye, and moistens the inner side of the eyeball, and the eye descends, and enters immediately: then tie it tightly until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	The treatment of Alcomnatus.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment known as Alcomnatis is not but squalor, which accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the manner of operating on it is, as you make the feeble one sit down on the prepared or directed seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take its head with your hands from two parts, and move it, until you see a healthy one flowing to the lower eyes of yours.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it will be shaped and not descend, and the light will be absolved: and the feeble one will see as before: and if it does not go down lower, you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of squalor is not prepared with that which I said, then make the feeble one sit down between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine dust, and find it with that above the thin membrane at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea of the eyeball, until the squalor goes down.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And when it goes out, then distill hot water into the eye in which you mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled Greek must and honey: then dress with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	The care of water which goes down into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	I have already said the species of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing a speech declare and demonstrate, then take it according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the feeble one sit down between your hands square, opposite to the light, near the sun: and tie the good eye of it with your hand, and hold it: then close the eye of it with your right hand if the eye through which the water goes is left: or with your left hand if the eye through which the water goes is right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take your right hand, if the eye is left; or your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of your finger near the corona, using the thickness of the ring in the same white appearance of the tearless eye: then push your finger with strength: and you will roll your hand with it, until it penetrates into the eyeball: and you will feel that your finger has now become wet.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of your finger's journey be to the depth, the space from the pupil to the end of the black part: and this is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the same pupil vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal layer.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place your finger up to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down with one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water comes down immediately, then your finger will see it above what opens its own eye at once, and your finger in its own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then the water comes down, then place it secondly, without your finger going out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is formed and does not rise: then take your finger out with ease: and you will roll your hand around a little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from the clear stone of the clear gem in water: and wash out the eye that is tired.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place around the eye a total plaster, or a sponge soaked in rose-scented oil, and the healthy eye: and tie them together.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and they who are of our time, place over it ground almond with rose-scented oil.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If a patch does not submit to your eye due to its hardness, because it comes from a man whose eye is hard-sighted: then you should take alberid, which is called spatumile, of which this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, when you make a connection with it alone, and not finally with your hand in the hole: and it is not otherwise but to make alive to a thin place for the patch.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the patch, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the end of the work, prepare a weak patient in a proper manner, who sleeps on his back in a dark room: and forbid all movements, and the snoring: and place the food of him which lenites his nature: and it will not turn his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its own disposition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and try his wisdom: and make him see the thing.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be made by him in the hour of care, or immediately after the incision: indeed it should be left, because water rises quickly through a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot apostema occurs: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh: and then correct it with that which soothes the apostema until it is soothing: then release his wisdom, and place on his face oral which is used according to the days some in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should gradually leave the house, and be conciliated in his cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	You know that in salve, the student is not exempt from vision several times: then he dares to supervise the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And already some of them, who are from Al-Yaris, said that it was made in Al-Yaris by piercing, through which water is thought to flow.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Indeed, I do not know anyone in your land who made this: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species, as one stands above them who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of true silver: and their ends should be the same as this similarly triangle-shaped one, with an sharp edge.
Formae magda.	Forms of silver.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	¶ About the care of the flesh of the newborn in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes, flesh is born in the nose of newborns, from which something resembles the many-footed scorpion: and from it is cancerous flesh, milky, white in color: and from it is that which is soft, not white in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that which is soft, not deceitful, and not cancerous of the flesh made from these, it is necessary for you to make the weak one sit between your hands facing away, and open its nose, and pull out the hair in those flesh: then take what you have pulled out with your nails, and rub it with a little sharp, acute wet soap, until you know that the whole flesh is completely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remains of it from which removal is not possible, then rub that with one of the fine tools with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If blood dominates you or if an acute burn occurs: then apply it according to what is appropriate: whether it is from harmful boils, then immediately cauterize it, until the blood abscinds and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then it is spat out of the nose after incising vinegar, and wine, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If however the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it up to the tongue, then you know that it is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If however the moisture does not penetrate, according to what is appropriate, then you know that there is flesh within it which has been formed in the upper bones of the nose, which does not become wet with the instrument during the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is appropriate to insert a thread of linen which has some thicknesses and nodes in it, and place the tip of the finger on each node with a small or fewer quantity of finger: and make the hand weak so that it pushes the end of one thread into the nose with the radio, or with which it is possible for it to be similar to the azer after it has made it: and draw out the odorous one, until it reaches the caassum, and goes over the throat of it.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed many children make such an Attom in their schools: and it is easy for him who wishes it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, the one that goes over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then and the string of flesh with the nodes which are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already with the nodes of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread: and place it in the nose after washing the blood with the linen which you drank in the Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place the end of the tube in his nose, and after a few days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however, there is a need for curing that dries out, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making the head-dress, when olive oil and other medicines are being distilled, make this out of silver or air: which is similar to a small lamp, open like a conch shell, and its opening should be similar.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed tube like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the conch should be full, with a handle for the head-dress, which you hold when heating oil or whatever you want to use from burning wood, and other flowable things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	¶ About the cure of Thelul's nose.
Caput XXV.	Head XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times, a head grows at the end of Thelul's nose, and it becomes more prominent and increases with days until a handsome appearance is achieved.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore, it is necessary to cut off the tip of his nose at the beginning of its appearance, and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on top of the place, or cauterization, or the medicine that is burning which is in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If then the cutting of it is slow until it becomes prominent, then consider if it is hard, black in color, few senses: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a wart that is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen the wart of the monk, and it happened because of it great malice towards him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the wart is a gentle touch, not black in color, and you see that the cut is possible throughout it, then remove the weak one, and cut it without fear, without pain: and take care of the place where it comes out and contracts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Regarding the stitching of the nose, and the lips, and the ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when the continuity of a certain one of the cartilages is loosened, it does not benefit much from the operation, except in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone from that, as you see, if it is a recent wound with its own blood, then gather the pain of the wounds with the stitching: and then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the continuity of the stitching in the lips has already been loosened, and a healthy part has been made of each: then it is necessary to remove all the part from its apparent side until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips with the stitching, and tie them, and poultice the blood of the dragon over it, and powdered olibanum: and place a fragment of the dried plaster above the pustules, and some of another plaster that has been consolidated: and release it tied for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it, and change the medicine: and release it until the threads die by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	But the method of stitching is to gather the looseness of continuity, or with a comb, as we have told you about the stitching of the breast: or gather the looseness with thread, as I have shown you to know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Regarding the extraction of the gums of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Indeed, many people have hard lumps in the interior of their lips, like small and large grains of certain plants. And some of them are smaller and larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to open the lips, and scrape around all the gums of it, and hang it with a needle, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the gap after the incision with three layers of thread, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then mix with vinegar, and keep the area where the styptic is located, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Of the birth of flesh on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Head 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh is born above the gum, which ancients call abulliss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore it is necessary that you hang it with a thong: or hold it with pincers and cut it off at its root, and let the healthy part run free, or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on top of the thread-filled place, or other styptic threads, excise them.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	What if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it off again and cauterize it: it itself does not return after the cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Of the reason of the teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they aggregate on the surfaces of the teeth from the interior and outer part, and between the gums, sharp, rough, and sometimes become black, and sometimes become white and yellow, until the corruption of that becomes visible to the gum, and the teeth become unsightly through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore it is necessary that you make the weak sit with their hands on your thighs, and their head in your belt, and rinse with water and tooth, in which appear the bristles, and such as are like sand: until nothing remains of them, and do the same for blackness, and whiteness, and yellowness, and others until they become clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then the good that is at the beginning of the reason is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the reason on another day, secondly, thirdly, until finally the desire in him who wishes to come to an end.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	You know that the tooth requires different shapes and figures of various razors, according to the preparation for your operation: the one on the side is different from the one between the teeth, according to the forms of another.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	These shapes of razors are prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ About the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you remove the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and later in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For the tooth does not supply its place when it is eradicated, because it is a substance of a high nature: until there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then it is necessary to consider the tooth that is painful as being weak, in order that it may be firm and certain to you before you eradicate it.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For the weak pain often deceives the weak pain, and thinks that it is in the tooth itself and eradicates it: then the pain does not leave until the weak tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When the tooth itself is certain to you before you, then it is necessary that you scrape around the tooth with salt, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers or with the finger-tips first slightly, until you rub it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the good wrenching on it with large screws, and the head of the weak tooth between your thighs: that which you hold firmly, in such a way that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not go out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and stir its motion as you have done at the beginning.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If the tooth is perforated or eroded: then it should be filled with that hole a piece of cloth: and tie it up with the end of the thin ends of the ribs, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction over it with the nails.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it should be done very carefully with the scarification all around the gingiva from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so as not to break it, and there remains a part of it, and remain above the greater malice that is in it first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And be careful not to do this that the ignorant make phlebotomers in their hurry, and the courage of theirs over the eradication of it, beyond what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often make the tooth even over the great infirmities of men, whose are harder to break, and all the roots of them or some of them: or to extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have often testified this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it is poured over after the eradication of it with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if the blood flow occurs from the places (for it often happens) then take something from the wool, and fill that place with it: and if not, cauterize it if it does not give you the wool.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the thin nails by which the tooth moves in the beginning, let them be long at the ends, short in the middle, thick, so that they do not double when they are put over the tooth: let them be as you see the thick nails, until when you tie with them, they do not bite themselves, nor double: short at the ends, and let them be of iron or of a nail made in a way that is not decent for the ends, and in their ends let there be teeth, which some enter into some, and are tied with a proper constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	When they become as far as the form of the jaw teeth which is called the hedgehog, and they are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	¶ On the removal of teeth and the extraction of the lower jawbone fragments.
Caput XXXI.	Head 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the site of tooth extraction, it is necessary to place a piece of dough with honey on that spot for one or two days until the area softens, and then insert an intromittere into the same hole, or forcipes, whose extremities are similar to the jaw teeth which is called the hedgehog.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This form is that of a hedgehog.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The ends of these should be made like drunken fingers: or like aliskifegs.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If then you do not obey to the end with these forcipes, it is necessary to make a cut above the root, and remove the entire flesh, and insert the instrument called the small Palanca, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	The end should be short, but rather thick: and it should not be drunk, so as not to break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If it goes down the root through this, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to use other instruments of this form with them.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The first form of the end is a triangle, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The subtle triangular form of the end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also necessary to use this instrument with two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It should also be juice with this instrument that is similar to the large uncino, of this subtle triangular form twisted, in which there is some thickness, so as not to break: and it should not be drunk.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	You know that there are many instruments of the dentist: and likewise other instruments are not counted, and the skilled artificer, being wise and subtle in his art, discovers the instrument by himself, according to which operation and ailments it signifies to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For they are made from diseases for which the ancients did not mention the instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the bone of the jaw is broken from the mandible, or from other bones of the face, or putrefies: then examine it in its place with what is convenient for it from the instruments and forceps which I said in the extraction of the tooth, and handle it with the grasp whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	There should be some roughness in it slightly, so that it may be tied or held with it, and not fear or hurt the tooth until it passes through the bone: and restore the place with suitable medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small putridity in the bone: then rub it with its own putridity, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	About the cutting of the projections of the teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Head thirty-two.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth are projected not according to their natural course, a monstrous form is made: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, virgins.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth is born after another tooth, and it is not set or its cutting is possible, nor its own limming: then remove it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument whose form this is.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small face, and it is made from iron, with sharp extremities, roughly.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	Your cutting should be done at the time of your choosing, due to the hardness of the teeth, and so that it does not affect another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	However, if the edge of your lipping is prominent: then you should sharpen it with a knife of this form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	The entire lipper should be made of the same material as the points of the scalpel, such as the lip that is made with the points: with which it is gradually sharpened over many days until it does not affect the tooth, and then it should be gently rounded off at the end with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If the tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary for the lip to also cover that, until the roughness of that fracture is removed and made equal: and it will smooth out and not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of the treatment of teeth with gold wire.
Caput XXXIII.	Head XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When there is concussion and movement of the teeth in front, or by accident: and a weak person cannot hold on to the one that bites them without it falling off: and they were cared for with stimulent medicines, and did not fail: then it is wise to tie them with gold wire, because silver becomes unclean after a few days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And the gold wire should be of medium thickness and grossness according to the amount that can be held between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	The method of the treatment is to take the wire and insert it twice between two healthy teeth: then you should tie it with the two ends of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until swelling occurs with thread up to the other part of the unhealthy tooth.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then continue reading the text until the part you began with: and tighten your hand with gentleness and wisdom, until it is absolutely firm: and let your constriction be where you tie the thread, at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess threads at the ends with a razor: and gather them together and turn them with your hand: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moving one, so that they do not hurt the tongue: then let it remain as tightly tied as possible.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is loosened or falls off, tie them with another thread and let it remain as tightly tied as possible for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the tooth and the figure of the incision of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth comes out, or two after the horse's heel, and remains as we have described, and does not come out unless it is done by a skilled, wise, and experienced artificer.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes it fits one of the bones of the horse's shoe: and it is made like the shape of the tooth, and is placed in its place, from where the tooth is fastened and tied, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	¶ About the incision of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XLV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes the ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural, which is present when man is born, or accidental, from the bone that has already solidified.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the weak bones in the head of the horse, and to split the tongue: then cut this nerve-like ligament through by its length, until it is loosened from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is a hard knot and a node in it, and it comes from the consolidation of a wound: then extract the thread, and find this along the width until you rupture the ligament, and the node dissolves.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And so, do not cause a fissure in deep flesh, and rupture the artery there, and blood flow may occur.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the incision with rosy water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen bandage under the tongue that will hold firmly all night, so it does not consolidate secondarily.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	However, if blood flow occurs, then place above the spot where the thread was cut, a poultice of ground barley.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If you do not stop the blood, then cauterize the spot with a sharp cauterization that is suitable for this, and then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	¶ About the extraction of Rahulla which is made under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Head XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an aphthae occurs under the tongue that resembles the small Rahulla, forbidding the tongue from performing its natural operation: and it may be so swollen that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is to open the weak mouth before the sun: and consider the aphthae.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If then you see that it is of a dark or black, hard color, which does not feel weak to the sense: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture: then extract the thread into it, and rupture it with soft soap, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood oozes during your surgical operation, place a piece of cloth soaked in vinegar on the spot where the blood flows, until the blood ceases to flow: then return to your operation, until you remove it along with its companion.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then mix it with vinegar and salt: and attend to it with a view to its healing, until it is cured.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	¶ About the curing of two breasts.
Caput XXXVI.	Head 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When certain things happen to the throat, that is, glands which resemble fine linen, and are called two Amygdalae: when these are cut along with what I said earlier, and do not heal, then consider them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If then it is a hard gangrene, of a red color, and few senses: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color, and the root of it is large: then do not touch it with iron, even though you fear the flow of blood, rather let it go, until it is fully ripe.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will perforate it: or it will break itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is white in color, round, and the root of it is fine: then it must be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in it is, that you consider beforehand, if the gangrene of it has been quietly completed warm, or if it is about to diminish by some decrease: then in this case make it sit down firmly in the sun, and the head of it should be in your groove: and open its mouth, and take hold of it with your hands, and cut off its tongue below with the instrument which is in that form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or air, which is as fine as a dagger.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you cut off its tongue, and it is shown to you as the gangrene, and falls on it: then take a thread, and sew it in the breast, and pull it out from it as far as you can, besides what you have taken with it from the cloth.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then make an incision in it with the instrument whose shape follows this.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It should be made like a lancet: for indeed its extremities are sharpened, so that the opening of each is on the opposite acute angle: therefore take care that it is made of iron or steel that can be dipped in fire.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then make an incision with a spatula, whose shape follows this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	The edge should be sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after making an incision in one breast, make the other incision in the same manner as the first.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after making the incision, soften the tissue with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there happens to be a flow of blood, gargle with water in which bark is bathed, or the leaves of myrtle and such like from stimulants, until the blood flow ceases; then take care of it until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when polyps are born in the stomach, other than the two breasts.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore make an incision in it according to what I said about the incisions of the two breasts equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	Indeed I have already treated a woman with a polyp that was born between the two breasts, which she pulled towards the gullet, a few senses, which had almost closed the gullet: and the woman breathed through a narrow opening, and had forbidden him food and drink, and had died if it had remained for one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the polyp only rose to such an extent that it emitted two branches, until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I will then proceed promptly and fasten one of them securely.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then draw it out, and a large portion will be taken from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then cut it off at the point where you can comprehend from the nostril's opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	I then made this of what came out of the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	I then opened his mouth and pressed his tongue, and then fastened the thong to it: I then cut off a large portion from it, and it did not bleed but only a little blood: The woman's throat was thus closed, and she began drinking water immediately, and then took something from her food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I did not then cease from the postnasal cavity for a long time: The postnasal cavity was located in that place which I was incising, until it became too long and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I then made an incision and cauterized the postnasal cavity between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	He remained still after the addition: I then walked around that part and do not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	¶ About the cutting of the postnasal cavity.
Caput XXXVII.	Head 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the cheek, and the postnasal cavity is affected, and it is long: Then it is called a vertical one: And if it is in the lower part of the cheek, it is round, then it is called a vesicle.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what I said in the division, and the treatment does not agree with it: And you see that the postnasal cavity left it hot and was fine: Then it is necessary to make an incision of it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is gathered from it, and it is not long, and it is bloodshot, or red, or black, and it does not have sense: Then it is necessary to cut off its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	In that very fear lies the weakness.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Then you should make it sit before you when I have described its length and shape according to the manner I mentioned, and place your tongue on the instrument whose description I have previously given: then fasten a thread around it and draw it down: and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for the incision of two breasts.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary to cut it only if that which is added above the natural end is without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut it more than that which is added above the natural end, you will hurt your tongue and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after cutting it, use the one we described for the incision of two breasts: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If the weak one is afraid of the cut, then it is necessary to use your skill in cauterization of it without fear and with gentleness.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not, unless with sharp water: and it is, that you place the head of the weak one in the socket of your thigh.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press your tongue on the instrument which I have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have given you for the cauterization of the head, and keep it with the unextinguished heel, and place it not thick, nor thin, and fill it with this concoction of this instrument, whose form is as follows.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extremity of it where it is placed with the medicine concoction be like the concoction of the radius of the cochlea.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same socket: and the weak one should lie on its side, so that saliva may flow from its mouth from within the medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to the throat of the same, and hurt it.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And then from the first part of it, divide it into equal parts of the first hour, so you can see it is already faded and worn out by the medicine's bitterness.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a bite and put it on the end of the finger, and then pour the bite with medicine, and insert the finger with the bite into the cannula from above, until it adheres to the thumb.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you find what you want for cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then release it: for it itself will wane and fall after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you wish to take the medicine again, take the same one: and after cauterization, wipe around the wound with the bite imbibed in honey, and cleanse it with that which is around it from the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And keep it outside with a swab, and gargle with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This is the type of curing that is more salubrious than the fearful incision and longer.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when it is cured even with that which is more subtle than the cauterization and incision, it is cured by fumigation, according to this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamus, hyssop, origanum, rue, sage, chamomile, and similar herbs from the plants: and gather all of them or some of them in a pot, and put them in vinegar and let them boil: and the pot should be covered with a clean cloth: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which the instrument of the chisel should be placed according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	It should be made of silver or metal: and it should be inserted into the end which has a grain of sand, into the weak bone, until the vapor rises to the thumb above the cannula, until the wound becomes very dark.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over the same spot until it fades away.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the patient's arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	However, it is also added to the apostematis for the patient: and it is not appropriate to do this except at the decline of his apostematis heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	However, if this instrument is not present to you, then take some wine, and make a sliver of the flesh at the end of it, so that the weak tooth does not burn: for the flesh of the sliver prevents the saliva from burning the tooth: and this is good for the health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	¶ About the extraction of thorns, and bones from the mouth.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	The bone or tooth often sticks in the throat, whether it is a fish's tooth or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it is necessary to remove what appears above that which falls down, after you have said the word with the instrument at the sun, and it is declared to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to remove a weak man before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the thing attached by vomiting will come out.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or perhaps the weak man will swallow a piece of chewed grass, or the root of the lettuce, or a piece of dry bread: or he may swallow a piece of dry marine salt, and then bind it to a thread, and then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When he has become saturated at the place where the thorns or tooth is, then it will be removed.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out with that which we said: then use the instrument from the ankle according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	The radius should be larger than the hand, and at its tip it should have a curvature that allows it to easily enter the throat of its own kind with ease: and it should itself have its head raised upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it guard against the touch of its own epiglottis, so as not to cause it to have a fit, and it should push with it the mouth, or the backbone, or it should insert it itself using the physician's hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed, if it weakly inserts, this is better: because of its knowledge of the location of the thing attached: and it should pull downwards, or draw its hand with the instrument upwards, all of which according to the quantity prepared for it, until it exits.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Regarding the extraction of bloodletting:
Caput XXXIX.	Head XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bloodletting is being treated with that which I said in division regarding the treatment with medicines, and it does not conform, then consider in the weak throat before the sun, whether at the sun after having placed the tongue of it with the instrument that I will tell you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your use falls on bloodletting, take it out with a small nail, or with a gesture that is appropriate for the occasion.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If that is not possible with them, then take a cannula with a fire-heated iron, and insert it into the weak throat as near to the throat as possible, and then insert into the cannula's ignition a hot iron.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this frequently: and let the weak one avoid water all day long.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let it drink a large amount of cold water, and open its mouth into it: and wash its mouth with it, and swallow nothing from it: and change the water once an hour after another with its own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For bloodletting, in fact, falls when it tastes water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, he does not follow with what we have related, then burn the weak one with cinnamon, or with ashes that are used in the suffumigation of gold.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, for it will fall away.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	The method of operation in suffumigation is as follows: take a pot, in which the wife's bloom is burned with fire; and the pot should be covered with a covering, in the middle of which there is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in this hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then blow the suffumigation, and place the weakest part of his own mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that he does not escape from the suffumigation until you know that the suffumigation has become bloody.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For bloodletting will immediately fall away.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall away, then repeat the suffumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the weak one will endure the pain, and will eat salt, and vinegar, and will not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary to let him go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which bloodletting is extracted from the stomach, when it falls on itself used.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like fingers, as you see: unless because this curiosity which he inserts into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end of it is like the beak of a gull, which has sharp claws: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	¶ About the opening of the Apostemum, and its section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of the Apostemum are many, in many kinds, according to which rememorance they come, that is, one and one in this book: and they are different in their perforation and section, from two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one is of the species of stitches in itself, and it because it includes from the wet things.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the place where it happens on the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For since the stitch happens in the head, it is different from the stitch that happens in the anus: and the stitch that happens in a fleshy place is different from the stitch that happens in joints: and each of these is judged according to its operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the stitches that it is not necessary for them to be made until after the maturation of the sore in them and its complement: and from these are those that it is necessary for them to be made while they are raw, and they do not mature according to the complement.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	So the stitches which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when the stitch happens near the joint, and it is extended to be, until it putrefies which is in its surrounding, perhaps the ligaments of it are corrupted, or the nerve of its joint: therefore it is the cause of the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is the stitch at the principal member: for if you delay its piercing until it matures, it will hurt either him or by that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is near the anus: and therefore it is the unmatured one: and it is not necessary to make it if the raw stitch is not complete according to the digestion, unless it is near the anus so that it does not putrefy deep, and it extends to the inner parts of the anus, or a fistula is made, or it is at the end of it which is not cured.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the hour of the stitching of the stitches which have matured according to the complement: and it is at the time of the sedative for the pain, the recession of the fever, and the diminution of the rubefaction, and the pulsation of the head of the stitches, and the acuity of the head: and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower position of the apostemates, and more prominent one: and let the perforation be warding in the length of the body, if the apostemates are in parts of hands and feet, and in places of fingers, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, let the perforation be made according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the aposteme is in flesh: then it is better to let the perforation of that be made, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you make the perforation before that, the course will be prolonged from it, and it will be much dirty and sordid, and perhaps the lips of it will be hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some apostemates are made according to the length of the body at the necessity: or according to that which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you give in the apostemates of small size a small perforation, and in those of great size a large one: or many sections according to the likeness of the size of the apostemates.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And they are from the apostemates in which it is necessary that the skin be cut: and it is applied when already it is like a cloth, and has been made in the end which is already dead, as that which happens in many cases, such as abscesses, and boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from them are those which are cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is that which is applied like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As for the apostemates of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which the circular section and the lunar section are administered, as well as similar ones from these sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	However, if there is no head, such as the smooth apostemata, it is necessary to perforate it through a superficial or flat perforation only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the apostemata is thick, and there is already a large amount of healthy tissue, to perforate it, so that not too much pus is drawn out at once: in fact, remove the part of it from outside.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then fill the apostemata with earth until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this repeatedly according to the degree until it drains: especially if the person is weak due to a weak force of life, or a pregnant woman, or a young boy, or an old man who has become feeble: for the animal spirit of the animal is resolved when the pus is discharged: and perhaps the weak one will die, and you will not know.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, through which you perforate the apostemata, it is necessary to cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then the wound of the apostemata is small, or it is a flat section, then apply a linen bandage, or an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the apostemata is large, and there are many perforations for the pus to escape, then it is necessary at that time to insert linen into all the fissures until they become wet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin, or have circumcised it in the apostemata: then it is necessary to fill it with an old cloth, or as when the linen is woven, or when it is shorn without moisture: and tie it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then extract the part of the skin that is affected and treat it with the ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	However, if blood flows occur during your operation time, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which the cloth is drunk: and place it over the site of the blood flow frequently.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	However, if the blood flow persists, then it is necessary to follow the prescription and treatment, and powders which I will mention in many places of these our books, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	However, if it is during winter and the site of the healing is of many nerves: then it is necessary to apply powders with wine, and hot oil: and place them over the site.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer and the site is soft: then it is necessary to place powders that have been drunk in water, and oil, or wine and oil, and all of this cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Then when the third day comes, as I said, then it is necessary to dissolve the plaster, and wipe it off, and administer to its treatment what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary for the knowledge of the plaster's cure in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the half of the distinction, I have already said about every plaster, how it is useful for its cure, individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	§ About the section of the plaster that happens on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small plasters happen on the scalp, and they are of the species of Nodorum, which are worn in the shirts which are made of them, as if they were hoses of geese.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species is many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	There are among them greasy ones; and there are like the sole of a shoe which contain moisture; and there are like the calloused and corky ones; and such as these, and there are hard stones like them.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in all sections, and the extraction of theirs is not to be feared, while among their sections there is no contradiction with the arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is as you see it with the instrument whose form comes after this, which is called the intromissive, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then dry it in the section according to the length of the surface section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line b to line g. And when the moisture is expelled, then the kistin which contains that moisture, will scrape it out and will not let anything pass through it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns, if there remains something in it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then dip the incision in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the flap with it, and let it stay until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will scrape what remains of the kistin.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the ointment over the incision with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the kistin, then care for the flap with the ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the aposteme contains a greasy node, then dry it according to this form, with the cross-section form: and remove the hairs between the double section, and scrape it out from all sides: and trust in your strength in the extraction of the tunic which contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, on the other hand, the artery causes you contrariety, then do this that I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, do in the gouge, if it is of stone, from sectioning, and curing the same, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section on the gouge of stone is easier: because it is few of blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these gouges which are in the head of those in whom there is hardly any moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: because I followed the gouge on the head of a young woman and found the gouge as if it were a hard, solid, rough, white stone, which could not be broken: and if it was curved with it, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In others however, there are accidents in the head of the gouges, except these gouges which happen in the heads of children, and at the roots of gold, the section of all of them is a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or first make a perforation of them always from the lower part of them, so that the course of the sanies may go to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for it with that which is convenient for them from the curing.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	¶ About the section of the Strophulars in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Head 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These gouges often happen in the neck, and under the shoulders, and in the thighs: and sometimes they happen in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those which happen from them in the neck, there are one or many: and they are generated from the wound: and all of the Strophlars are within the proper tunic of him, as is in the nodes and gouges of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	The species of these Strophulars are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And among them there are stones: and among them there are those that contain moisture: and among them there are malignant ones that do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that therefore which you see of good disposition in the incision, whose color is near to the skin color, and moves to all parts, and is not annexed with the muscles of the neck, nor with the guide-bones, nor with the arteries, nor is deep: it is necessary to cut it off superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b. to line g., and scrape it off from all parts: and extend two lips of the skin with a razor, or with many razors, if you need that for shaving, as we said in shaving the scalp, and take it out slowly.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is over the caution, that it may not be mad, or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel be not sharp and rough: so as not to add to your hand when you make the incision, or disturb the weak, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If however you cut a vein, or an artery, or prevent your operation, then place the thumb of the right hand on the ulnar tendon, or some children who cut the blood, and draw the thumb, and release it, until the sharpness of the stitches is quieted, and the thumb relaxes the ulnar: or begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is then cut, then return to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then inquire with your finger, if something remains of the Strophuli from other parts: then cut them, and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If however it is a great madness in the root of the Strophula: then it is necessary to cut that Strophula from its root: rather it is necessary to tie it with a strong thread doubled, and release it until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with an old bandage that you have already dipped in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then, take care of it yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the stitch is completely through, then you should gather the two lips of the wound at once, and sew them immediately after you see that there is no excess left.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	However, if you see that there is excess due to the size of the stitch, then you should pay attention to inserting the root of it and pulling it out: and apply the suture that I mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And which contains moisture from Strophulus, make a hole through that superficial incision: so that you can see the location of its maturity: and place the incision below the body, as I mentioned.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the hairpin with ointment after the incision, and similar ones, so that what remains of corruption may be consumed until you see that the wound is already clean: then take care of it with the ointment generated by the flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ About the cutting of the epiglottis from an aphthous ulcer in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Head 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said this cutting of the epiglottis in the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who made it: and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those who have synchondrosis, the cutting of the epiglottis should be avoided: because it will not cause swelling by that: for all wounds and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	But in those who have a hot sore in the mouth, or throat, or both lobes of the breast, when there is no illness in the glottis, it is necessary to use the cutting of the epiglottis to escape from the destruction that comes from precipitation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	When we wish to cut the epiglottis, we should make three or four sections of it along its length, not in the cartilage, but in the lean part. For this is a suitable place for sectioning, as it is fatty and has much blood vessel nearby.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then it is necessary for him to extend the skin of the throat with a quill.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he will examine the skin, until it becomes moist around the cannula: if he sees any blood, he should let it flow into the cannula.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the lean part that we have mentioned: and this signifies the cut made above the cannula, when it comes out of it, with the part that is torn off, and the division of the tongue.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And release the incision at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When the hour comes that you fear the wound, gather together the two lips of the skin incision, and take only its own flesh without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines that cause the flesh to grow, until it is cured.
Inquit Albucasis.	As Albucasis says.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this narrated discourse is not an exposition, unless they see that some of these operations have weakened the throat of a weak person: and the weak one has become stronger after death, and wishes to be cut across the anxiety of the weak one: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the weak one may breathe on a place of wounding with some breathing, and may be saved from death: and therefore they commanded to release the incision, until the malice of the disease is consumed, and it is the malice of the disease three days, and almost itself: then they commanded to close the incision again, and to care for it, until it is cured.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	This is what I have seen with my own eyes, that a certain woman swallowed a dagger, and sent it down her throat, and it lodged in the part of the lung's branch.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	I was called to attend to her, and found her to be panting, as if of one dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore cut the skin, and found blood that had escaped from the small vein.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I was surprised that she did not cut the skin, nor bleed, but the wind was escaping from the vein.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I immediately examined her own vein and cared for it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the woman unless there was a cough in her throat: and she returned to me on the following day with a better arrangement of her own.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Here I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Regarding the section of the hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Head 43.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia, named hernia of the throat, is a large aposteme according to the color of the body: and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural case, certainly there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one is of two kinds: one is similar to a small bunch of feathers.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an aposteme which is made from the node of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in itself there is fear, and it does not need to be assumed about it with iron, unless in the small one: and you prove it, and investigate it when you intromite.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then I find it similar to a small bunch of feathers, and it is not suspended with any veins: then dry it, as the feathers are dried: and take it out with the thing that contains it from the kist, if it is in the kist: and if not, then examine the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place along with it that is necessary for the treatment, until it recovers.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	¶ Regarding the section on the species of the Northern Lights.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of the Northern Lights, and I have already mentioned all their species in division: it is necessary to tell the difference between Nod and Exitur: since there is doubt about this.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say that when Exitur is heat, and fever, and severe pains, until it erupts with superfluous ebullition, and completes putridity: then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When Nodo is not heat, nor fever, nor pain, and contains them in kistis sifachin, which is their proper bag, and is according to the color of the body: and it is an intermission of theirs like a chestnut, and is like a cloth, and greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: either fat: or contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you are wetting for the treatment of Nodo, it is necessary to try it, and first inquire with it by the instrument called Intromissive, according to which the form of it will be in the chapter that is after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inquiry is as follows, and for all Nodo: take this instrument, and insert it into a wetter place that you find in the aposteme: and turn your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then the last hand of yours according to the measure of the aposteme.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then take out the Intromissive, and consider that which will come out in the wound of it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If then moisture runs, whatever its color: then dry it by surface section, as I said in the previous incisions.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not run in the incision of intromission, then you know that it is fatty: then dry it by surface section having the form of a cross, as I taught you: and suspend it with threads, and exfoliate the skin from all sides with ease: and guard the knot if you can over it, so that it takes away the whole healthy part with the nail.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the knot is broken during the operation and it cannot be taken out, often this happens, then take it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little remains of it, or much, the nail returns to the knot according to the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If you do not close it, and a little remains, then fill the wound with the thin, sharp-edged leaves, and tie it, and put the hot aposteme above it, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then the nail is large, then use two lips of it, and care for it with the part that is in the flesh.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If then the evil spirit is a small, pulsating one, or not pulsating, then immediately fill the place with fresh dressing, and let it be loose for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and stops bleeding: then return to treat the remaining part of the nail.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ About foreign instruments for sectioning and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three forms of incisions, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	From these it follows that there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	May the corners of the alphabets be made equal in size, so that they may quickly enter into the apostelles.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of experimentation, and not, that is, they penetrate: and one of them is called bore, that is, penetrating: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	From these it follows that there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They should be brought together so that they can be investigated through the apostelles and exits, and fistulas, and bladders, from the one that is between them made of bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, thin, and soft, like the large needles on which the seats are placed, made of cinnamon, or of silver, or of iron, or of gold.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And their better ones are those that are made of cinnamon.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also experimentation from the black lead, which are brought together so that they can be investigated through the apostelles and fistulas, whose reflections are reflexions, so that they may be reflected with their own lenity when they are in contact with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are of three kinds again.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them there are long ones, from them medium ones, and from them short ones, according to the quantity of the width of the apostelles and the strictness of their stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of the Vulvae, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them there are simple ones, that is, those with one curvature: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them there are blind Vulvae: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them there are uncini with two curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and from them there are uncini with three curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	These are the forms of scalpels by which nails and thorns are cut and exfoliated, and stitches: and they are three kinds: for there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities by which the section is made are sharp, while their other extremities are not sharp: they are not placed thus, except when there is fear of injury to the nails or to the vein, or to heal the weak one and find tranquility from the ash that he finds at exfoliation of stitches.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the magdas, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal, and they are similar to Radio, with which alcohol is made: and at the flat end there is a hidden point of Spatumilis: and it runs to the interior and the exterior when you wish, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of Spatumilis which is hidden between the fingers at stitching: and the weak do not perceive them: and they are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	Forms of the winds with which the blood flow is cut: and they are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They should be made of metal or citrine, round, about the length you see, and they should be fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these forms of the winds be large and small at you: so that you may cut blood with ease at need, and then when there is no nearby medicine.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	Nevertheless, you will not use them in cutting of blood in all parts of the body, and you will only use them in places of flesh: such as the thighs of the knees, and the hips, and the thighs of the arms, and the breasts, and the nostrils, and the groins, and such as these, from humid flesh.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	When they are made from them, small instruments similar to those of the boxer are made from them, according to their shape: which are used to cut blood when it flows from the site of phlebitis, or at the wound of the vein, or of the artery. And when they are made, they are made in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Regarding the care of mammary glands in humans that resemble those in women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	At times, the breasts of some men become inflamed in the complement of sleep (that is, when they begin to seep during sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and the pain remains chronic.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, he who detests this, it is necessary to apply a moon slice over the breasts, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the grease.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the vulva with the medicated graft.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather the two lips of the wound with the suture and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the breast slopes downwards and softens due to its own size, as happens in women: then it should be divided into two upper sections of similar lunar shapes, with one of which contained in the other at their extremities, until a line is larger containing a smaller one, according to this shape from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin that is between the two lips and remove the grease, and apply what I have mentioned about the suture and the poultice, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not close the incision of that which needs to be made due to your weakness or due to the flow of blood: then it is necessary to fill the vulva with a submerged razor ointment and release it, until the remaining part of the grease has corroded.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it itself until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	¶ About the puncture of the trocar, which happens under Titillus.
Caput XLVIII.	Head 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These punctures that happen under Titillus are of the hard species of Strophulus, which contain kernels, and some of them contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Which therefore are those that contain moisture, it is necessary for them to be cut into the shape of a crescent, from line b to line g, when the entire substance that is in the puncture from the sore has escaped, then fill it with the old cot, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the cot, and dress it with a suitable ointment for that, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the puncture is of the kind of Strophulus nodes, then cut over it as we have said in the section over Strophulus, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends in this way as to emit pus, then apply to it the cauterization as we have said in that which was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	¶ About the section of the puncture that happens due to the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Head 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is torn and the skin that is above it becomes consolidated, a puncture often occurs from there, and similarly an inflammation and puncture occur in the vein as well, as occurs in the inflammation and puncture in that vein.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the puncture and inflammation are due to the artery and vein are: because when the puncture is due to the artery, it is long, gathered in the deep part of the body: and when you press the puncture with your fingers, you feel as if there is a stridor in it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	This is what is for the vein, it is round in the clear body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section above this aphorism is an error, and especially what is under the eyes, and the groins, and the neck, and in many parts of the body: it is a great flaw.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it should be treated with iron, and what is even more, or at the extremities, or in the head, it should be treated.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, over that which is from them that is from the inflation of the opening of the artery, find in the cut section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with the wrappings, then the artery: and free it from the sheets, until it is revealed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert under it the acum, and make it penetrate as far as to another side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then press the place which is between the two ligaments with sand, until the blood that is in it all escapes, and dissolves the aphorism.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for it with suitable ointments to that, until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	That if it is an aphorism for the section of the vein, then it is necessary that you hold your hand with which you can possibly hold the aphorism with the cut.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the acum under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and there should be a thread double in it, until it takes out that from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the aphorism with the good ligament with the aphorism which I taught you in the good vein, with two parts from two parts of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread will be drawn out, then insert another needle with a thread of another kind under the stitch at the incision of the needle: press, and draw your thread into four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the stitch in the middle of it, until when it comes out that is: then incise the excess skin, and let what is tied go from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place over it the piece of cloth which you dipped in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the remedy which is made with lances and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	¶ About the stitch that happens from the twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	So a stitch happens in the artery and vein, so it happens in the nerves: that happens to them by blow, or happens by overwork, and similarly: and it happens most of all in the places of helpers, or in the heel, and in every place where the joints are tightened: and it is a serious stitch.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles the color of the other part of the body, and it is in many places without pain: and when it is tied with force, it feels in it a weakness similar to that of amaurosis.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a gathered stitch in the deep body, indeed it is under the skin, and it moves to all parts, and does not reach to the front, neither before nor after to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What therefore comes from them in the joints, it does not need to be with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps it may happen a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that however which comes from them in the head or in the face, find the skin with sweat.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then it is a small stitch, hold it with thorns, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If it is large, then suspend it itself on wax, and exfoliate it. Then remove it, and gather the tendon with the suture: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Translation: Regarding the sectioning of the apophyseal line, which occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Head, 120.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Translation: This happens to some people often in their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungal warts, due to similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Translation: Whose root is fine, and their head is large, and their lips are convoluted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	Translation: And it is from them that is small, and it is from them that is the one that is magnified in a soft manner.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	Translation: And I have already seen a man, and in his abdomen were two Fungal warts that were more than other similar mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white, small root, and his lips curled, and they were moistened from them always.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Translation: Therefore I burned them, and I found in the weight almost 18 and 8 ounces, and in the other almost 6 ounces. And the operation in their section is, as you see now, if the humid one is weak, and the color of the Fungal warts is white, moist, and subtle root: then burn it with spumous sides, and be present with your cauterization in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	Translation: For much blood is expelled at this section of his blood: therefore, if you do not bleed much, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Translation: And if you see a weak and timid one from the section with iron, then take the thread from the tail made in an appropriate manner, and string it with the athelul: whose mode is what I said, and release it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead of mercury.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not then cease to draw mercury until it is pressed into the wound and then falls out on its own without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	However, if the wound is large at its base, there is some fear and weakness in it, especially in the stomach.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless, it may be possible to make an incision through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it until the stomach is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And be careful not to assume that the wound is dark-colored, few senses, unpleasant appearance: for it is actually a cancerous ulcer, and I have healed with remembrance of the crab after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	¶ On the care of the prominence of theumbilicus.
Caput LII.	Head 12.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	This prominence of the umbilicus is caused by many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from the fissures of the sigmoid, which are above the stomach: and it exits through the anus, or the intestine, according as happens in the others.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows out of the vein, or from the artery, according as was previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the congestion of the water in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	However, if it is due to the fissure of the sigmoid and the exit through the anus: then the color of the apostema is similar to that of the body: it is soft, without pain: and appears to have different sites.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine: then the site of it is like that which we have mentioned, with a more severe diversity of its sites.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and may have a sound with it: and it is greatly admired at the entrance of the bath, and the labor of the weary.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If indeed it is due to moisture, it is spongelike, and then it does not hide when you place it with your own hand, nor does it contract, nor is it added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If indeed it is due to blood, then with these signs appears clotting to blackness from the clitoris.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If indeed it is due to fresh flesh: then it is clotting gray, thick, hard, and formed according to the quantity of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is due to moisture, then its touch is spongelike.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation is such that you consider at that time, if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to blood of the Artery, or Vein, or moisture: then it is necessary for you to prohibit its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and weakness, as I have told you in the chapter, wherein I said clotting due to the Artery and Vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If indeed the prominence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or gut: then it is necessary for you to preemptively treat the weak one, so that he may hold his thirst and stand extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with incense around the whole umbilicus.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then preemptively command him to lie down between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround it with a wide brush around the place where you marked with incense.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the clotting to the upper parts with a large uncino.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around the strong part with thread or with a firm cord: and let the knot be of silk.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the extended clotting above the tie.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If then you find it already caught from the tie: then take it out by the knot, and insert your thumb indicated, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find the gut: then take it with a uncino and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, on the other hand, the opposite vessel or vein is hard, then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert into them two strong wires: and insert two needles into the circumference that you made around the aposteme in the form of a cross, which you are making to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then string the aposteme in four places over the needle: and if you will, take out the needles and give up the place, until the putrid extended flesh puts out: and falls by itself: or cut it when it becomes subtle and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with that which is appropriate from the ointment, until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the eminence of the umbilicus is from the flesh of the belly or from moisture: then it is necessary to make the aposteme as I have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood, or the moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for it with that which solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Regarding the care of the cancer.
Caput LIII.	Head 33.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	I have already said about the division of the species of cancer, and how it is to be treated with medicines: and caution must be taken from it while treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate: and I have said that cancer generated in the womb, and the precaution against its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, as the cancer which is in the breast or in the thigh, and such like, from the fixed members to take it all of it: especially when it is beginning to be juvenile.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it becomes old and large, it does not need to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I myself have not been able to heal anyone from this; nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in doing so.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	The operation, when it is placed as I have said, is, as you know, and dissolves the weakness from black vomit several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if I find a phlebotomy itself with clear fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the weak one with preparation, in which the operation will be placed.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then remove the warts that meet with it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then cauterize it completely from all sides according to the measurement, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow freely, and do not cut it ruthlessly, indeed mark the location, and wipe away the coagulated blood with your hand, or with whatever is available there with the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	However, if the flow of thick blood from the cut artery or vein causes you a contrary effect, then cauterize the wound until the blood is abscised.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ About the Cure of Hydropia.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 133.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already described the division of the species of hydropia, and how the aggregation of water occurs, and the signs of all kinds and the treatment of it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron are not except the asclepian alone, and do not approach with iron the species of gall; nor does the species of hydropnia closely approximate to it, for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of hydropnia with medicines and it does not respond to your treatment, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the weakness has already been brought upon the patient, or if there is another weakness with it, such as tussis or watery sputum, and so on: then beware of treating it with iron, for that is the fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see an infirmity of a most robust vigor, then there is no other sickness but hydrosophy: and it is neither boy nor old man: then the mode of the operation is such, that you remove the infirm one standing by your hands, and minister to him afterward with your hand, pressing water with it towards the lower part of the fingers.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spongy wet cloth, in this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let the two sharp parts be long and pointed like spongy wet cloth.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there is something thinning gradually in it, so you will not pierce through it with the operation up to the intestine, and hurt it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if it is the generation of hydrosophy from the intestinal part, then it is necessary to elongate with the section from the umbilicus of three fingers' length, towards the lower part in directio above the fingers.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed the generation of hydrosophy is on account of the sickness of the thigh, then your section should be left from the umbilicus of three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is on account of the spleen, then the section should be right on the side: and it does not need to be a section on the side above where you wish to place the weak one, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate with the instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert the section into it, and remove your hand with the spongy wet cloth between the skin, and rub it as if you are scraping it off, like you are scraping off nail polish: and the quantity that is scraped off should be the same as the quantity of nail polish.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape and rub until the spongy wet cloth reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove it, and insert the instrument into the foramen, whose form is this.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or gold and copper, lead, or wax: it has a small hole on its lower part, and on its sides, there are three holes, two from one side and one from the other: its face is the sharp extremity of an incision, according to the size of a reed's edge, as you see: at its upper end, there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument is wet with water, then it sinks immediately on the instrument, therefore it draws out half a liter of water in one hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you draw out more than is proper in one hour, it may happen that the weak one dies by a resolution of its animal spirit: or it may happen to him that he has a syncopal state which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, you draw out from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what positions of weakness in its heart pulse signify to you, and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and hold the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it holds immediately due to the skin which holds the hole that is above the face: about which I will tell you, so as to perforate it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then try the instrument on the other day, if you see the weak one to endure that: and also remove a small amount of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this on several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains but a small amount of water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the weak one, and let out much water from it: then care for it with a large amount of earth, and much sweating in the hot bath and sun, and expect it over time: and care for it with the medicines that have been extinguished, until it is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I will tell you in it that precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	The care of children who are born in places where their urinary passages have not been opened.
Caput LV.	Chapter 57.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any child leaves the womb of its mother, and the head of its body is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or in a wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to assist with the perforation of its head immediately when it is born, using a thin sponge, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin sponge under the tail, and tie it: and keep it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When the child wishes to urinate, it is removed, and it is emptied.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the sponge, it is possible that the urine which comes to the place will not allow it to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, the one whose opening is narrow, is treated with a sponge, as I said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	However, those in which the opening is not in its place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from them who are born, the opening is at the end of the female child's head: therefore, it cannot urinate until the woman lifts herself by her hand to the upper part.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is it generation for her, therefore, because the seed cannot be discharged into the womb according to its rightness: and it is a painful evil.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of the operation in that is, that it is flaccid above its back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of that woman with your left hand firmly, and cut off the head of her child from its place, at the tip of the penis, as it were, or a sharp sponge: just as a nail is cut, or just as you would cut something like this with your fingers, so that the middle of it resembles the head of a girl's head: and let the opening fall in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And for your sake in your operation, let there be no flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, oppose it with what it cuts off blood and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding Albather, which happen in the prepuce and head of the penis, and blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Head LVIII.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	Indeed, these Albathers often happen in women, and it is a flesh of the ugly one.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from this there is another that is evil, and another not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, it is not evil that you hang with a fine uncini, and cut it off, until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put over it the submerged belly in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it after that with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If Albather is evil, of the ugly color, then it is necessary to apply a cauterization after cutting and its reason.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however Albather is in the prepuce of the uncircumcised, and it is a part of Albather between the prepuce, and a part of its outside: then it is necessary to remove Albather which is inside first, until when it is solid, then take care of the outside: because when you take care of it at the same time, the prepuce does not become retracted.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also happen even in the testicles, and blackening and corruption of the prepuce.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cut off everything that is already degraded, and what you want to corrupt, or already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then put a line over it after that with mell with which it is already crushed with flour of corticum granatorum, and herb tritorum cribellatorum.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then, that care, like the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If however, there is a flow of blood, then administer the cauterization with the moon-shaped cauterization, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cauterization is a boiling of iron to two dispositions at once, namely to the flow of blood, and the moon when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If however, the head of the female genitalia is corrupted and destroyed in an hour, then it is necessary to insert a cannula from the plumba into the meat, so that it may be weak on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However, in the restraint of the prepuce of the female genitalia, and this restraint does not happen unless in the one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required above it: and sometimes it happens by the moon, or an apostema: therefore, it is necessary to remove it with a soft sandal, until the ligament is dissolved, and the head of the female genitalia is free from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If however, it is difficult to distinguish this precisely, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the female genitalia, and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	What this is, because the prepuce when it is thin, may perhaps be pierced through due to its thickness carelessly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce and the head of the female genitalia with a fine linen cloth which has already been made in cold water, so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is dressed with wine-wort, until it is healed.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	¶ About the cleansing of children, and the treatment of their accidental errors.
Caput LVII.	Head LXXVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a loosening of the continuity, as the rest of wounds: but nevertheless, since it is our operation, our will, and its use is proper in boys, it is necessary to signify a better operation and a health-giving joy in it.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say then that the ancients did not say anything about circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired by experiment.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I have found that a greater part of artisans and surgeons use mutilation, circumcision with a razor, and with needles, and cutting with a needle, and incision with the finger, and amputation with a knife.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have indeed tested all of these methods, and I do not find a better cleaning with needles, and tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in cleaning with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore it may be that the upper layer is cut, and the lower layer is the foreskin: it is thought that an incision should be made for the other to come in contact with, and pain will be felt.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And since the cleaning that is made by those who use needles, that is, the thumb, which they use to cut, does not secure the incision of the male member: for perhaps it will enter into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	However, in cleaning with the finger, perhaps the iron is drawn out, and corrupts your operation: and the skin of children is naturally thin, and is born in this way, so that they do not need cleaning: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, the experiment of cleaning with needles and tying with thread has given me a good result: for the needles are proportional to the incision: therefore, because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below,
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	For when you place your hand, the two sharpnesss are proportional, and they happen at the same time on one operation: and a similar compression is made, containing the skin of the woman from all sides, without any error whatsoever.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The method of the operation is such that you make the boy believe, above all else, that you are not doing it unless you tie the thread only in his own sheath: and then you let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him happy and praise him as much as possible with what you can, because of the understanding he receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and do not let him sit: and hide the instruments in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor any part of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his sheath, and blow into the skin, and draw it up until the head of the sheath goes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it with the dirt that accumulates in it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the place marked with a thread double.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie the lower part of it according to the best you can.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger, and make a good hold on the lower part of the tie, and cut between the two ties.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then pull up the skin upwards quickly, and take out the head of the sheath.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and place the boy over it: and on top of the boy, put a bandage in which the sheath was expanded, soaked in decocted rosewater, beaten with fresh rose oil good: and let him stay on it until another day: and take care of him the rest of the care until he is cured.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	However, the form of the suture for cleansing is...
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be heated, and be incident: so that it does not go out at the ends: and let the length of the two acute angles be equal to the length of the two fingers.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	My error in falling into corruption is that perhaps the internal skin has escaped entirely, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary to extend it from your hour with your nail before the site of the aperture: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with a razor, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If more than three days have passed, and there remains what is under the foreskin swollen, incised, then let it be until the hot aperture is set, and let it excoriate it with ease, and cut it according to what you are prepared for: and beware of the head of the foreskin.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not hurt it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Take care of it with that which consolidates the thigh from the pubes which we have spoken about in the treatise on puberty: and if it is cut from above the size, and extends to the upper parts, it will not hurt it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Take care of it with that which we have said, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ About the removal of the urine retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Caput LXXX.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by that which is made from the powder of a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or new flesh, and such as we have spoken about in the ways of healing.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if it does not pass, and you see the retention of it to be because of the stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it will be necessary for it to be weak under its knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they will be placed on the back of its feet, and the urine of its body will be extended from the upper part of its back, and the weak thirst will be tied as much as possible for it.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	When it is considered that the wound of the throat is to be used for the expulsion of stones towards the back: therefore, the gargle is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If the gargle does not dissolve with what we said, and it is a matter of something above the weakest: then it is necessary to administer the extraction of that with the instrument called siringa, which is silver in form, and is fine, soft, like a linen thread in the subtlety of a radii, long like the palm of one's hand and middle finger: of which there should be a fine cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	The manner of the exit of the gargle through itself is, to take a double thread, and tie at the extremities of it wool or cotton, and a good ligature: and then introduce the extremity of the thread into the inferior part of the siringa: and cut if there be any excess of wool, thus introduce into the cannula with forceps, as is done with a needle.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then place the siringa with oil, or with butter, and honey: and make the weak one sit on the seat, and rub the wound, and the wife's with oils, and humid olive oil, and hot water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the siringa into the woman's wound with ease, until it reaches the root of the wound.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then make two of it above the part of the belly.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then press the siringa into itself, until it reaches the bladder, and the weak one feels that she has passed it through the womb: and this is not done in this order, unless the meatus, through which it goes, is also in the tortuosity.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the gargle follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it and make it run through the urinary passage of the vine: and then sow the seed, and do not cease doing this until the urine is emptied, and you find an unreliable alleviation.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	¶ Regarding the quality of vesical cleansing with Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 69.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the uterus, or blood congeals in it, or pus forms in it, and you distill water and medicines into it: then make with the instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is because it is hollow, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And there are three openings in it, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the place where the impelling force is located should be according to the amount that it contains without addition, until when it is drawn with something, it attracts from the moisture: and when it is driven, it expels it to a distance: according to which Clepsydra operates, which expels naphtha, that is, the Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to expel moisture from the uterus, insert the extremity of the Clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with it that which impels to the upper part, for moisture is drawn into the hollowness of the Clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert the extremity of it into the woman, according to what we have said in sowing.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then drive the moisture with it, that is, the force which drives that very moisture to the uterus immediately, so that she feels it unreliable.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The subtle form of Clepsydra by which the uterus is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	May silver or gold be used, whose head is higher than the tip of the little finger, and on which side there is a small cavity in which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a bowl of warm water and moisten the uterus with it to make it clitoralize.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two strong ligatures with double thread, and heat it slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the clitoral end into the uterus, then tightly wrap your hand over the uterus with a suitable moisture, until it feels weak due to the moisture that has become sufficient for the uterus.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If the uterus is not present, then take a slice of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it through its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert the thread firmly into those holes, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle as the almond gathers: after you place on it what you want to extract from the moisture, oil, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and make as you did with the uterus when you extracted it with your hand, until the moisture reaches the uterus.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Head LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have already spoken of the division of the species of a stone and its cure with medicines, and I said the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and the uterus, and the signs of its whole: and I said the stone that falls with the hand and section, and that is the true stone generated in the uterus, and the one that is figuratively represented in the womb: and I am now telling you this with a clear and abbreviated explanation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say that it happens most frequently in boys, a stone generated in the bladder.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs, it appears that the urine exits from the bladder, similar to water in its subtlety: and there is white sand in it, and the weak man rubs against it, and labors with it, and often hangs on it.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised up, and it goes out with it to the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is an easy cure for boys, from that time forward, up to fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, in boys, it is medium, in that which is between it: and the cure of the one whose stone is larger is easier: and if the boy is younger, it is an increase of that care.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to the cure, it is necessary first of all to cleanse the weak man with clysters, so that he takes out all the feces that is in his intestines: for he sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the weak man takes it with his feet, and he stirs it up, and moves it downwards, so that the stone may go to the depth of the bladder, or it may rise from its place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and the hand of the weak man should be under his belly, so that the bladder is entirely inclined towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you then feel the stone in space, then immediately with a cut above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall entirely under your touch, then it is necessary to wipe the finger with oil from the left hand of the weak man, if he is a boy: or the middle finger if he is an elderly one completed: and you should introduce it into his anus, and examine the stone until it is under your thumb: and then turn him slowly towards the belly of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your thumb and push it towards the opposite side of the location whose section you wish to see. And command the assistant to apply forceps with his hand, and command others to extend his testicles with his right hand, and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part of the location where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the speculum recedens, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find there what is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but on the left side: and let the section be on top of the stone, and your thumb on the anus: and let the section be transferred so that it is an external wide section, and an internal strict one, according to the possible exit of the stone from it, not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the thumb that is on the stone at the section will compress it and exit without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone from which the angles and edges come, why it is difficult to exit because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from there it is soft, like a gland, and round, and it becomes easy for its exit.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, from which the angles and edges are, add to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	That is, if it does not exit in this way, then it is necessary to have engines above it: or to string above it with a rope whose end is like the moon, which strings on top of the stone and does not tear away from it: or to insert under it with a subtle instrument, with sharp ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	But if you cannot insert above it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	That is, if something comes out of your blood, cut it off with the knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if the stone is more than one, then push the largest one to the mouth of the forceps.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then make an incision over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a small probe after that, and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the wound is large, then ignorance is knowing it has slipped over the large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it often happens with an ill person of one of two things, either to die, or a constant urine distillation occurs: because the place does not fully consolidate.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Indeed, administer the expulsion of it, until it comes out: or if the intelligence is in the fracture with the sutures, until it is taken out piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the gauze with wool, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and tie it up, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water: so that the apostemae becomes warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then cover the weak one over its neck, and do not dissolve the ligament, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, rub the place with water and oil much.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment dyafinicon, and ointment basilicon, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however, a hot apostemae is added to the gauze, and cracking, and similar to this: as if blood freezes in the ute, and it is forbidden to come out of the urine: and it is known that this comes out with the blood and urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the gauze, and take out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, call for corrosion of the ute, and putrefaction of it.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then clean the gauze with vinegar, and water, and salt: and place every kind of ointment with that which is convenient for the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	It is necessary during the hours of medical care to attend to both thighs and gatherings, the causes of medicine that are laid upon the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is smaller and is in the female urethra and is seen there, and it is stopped up, then care for this at the same time as the urinary discharge that I mention before the division.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Indeed, you will often excuse the section by this treatment, for I have already proved this.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is that you take the perforator from the iron of Alffericus, whose form this is, triangular at the ends, sharp at the top, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it to the female with the stone under the rock so that she does not return to the uterus.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the iron perforating into the female with ease, until the perforator reaches the same rock: and turn the perforator with your hand in that same rock a little at a time, and you will make the perforation of it, until it penetrates from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Indeed, urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over that which remains from the rock of the female on the outside part of the female.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	Indeed, it will break and go out with urine, and the weak will be made strong.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	However, if this treatment is not prepared for you due to something that prevents it from being under that: then tie the thread under the rock, and another thread above the rock.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then wet the rock above the female between the two threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterward, dissolve the thread, and clean the frozen blood that is made in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the rock unless it does not return to the uterus: and another thread above if it does not return to the skin when the thread is untied after the rock is removed, returns to its own place, and covers the wound. And for this you must tie the thread above when you tie the thread above so that the skin is raised over the superior parts, so that it may be at your complement, and cover the wound as I have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	The section is titled "Extraction of Crystals from Women" in English. However, it's important to note that this phrase is metaphorical and not literal. In the context of medieval Arabic medicine, "extraction" often referred to the process of extracting or removing certain substances or matter from the body. The term "lapidis mulierum" is a Latin phrase that translates to "crystals of women," which is also metaphorical and likely refers to a specific medical condition or substance. Without the original context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Caput LXI.	The section Caput LXI is titled "Chapter LXI" in English. This is a numbering system used in medieval manuscripts and texts to organize and reference different sections or chapters. Without the original text, it's difficult to provide more context or a specific translation for this section.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The phrase "Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus" translates to "The crystal is hardly produced in women" in English. This is a metaphorical expression and not a literal description of a medical condition or substance. In the context of medieval Arabic medicine, it's likely that this phrase refers to a specific medical condition or theory related to the production or absence of certain substances in women's bodies. Without the original context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	The phrase "Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibendum propter modos multos" translates to "However, if it happens to one of them, then the treatment is difficult and is forbidden due to many methods" in English. This is a metaphorical expression and not a literal description of a medical condition or substance. In the context of medieval Arabic medicine, it's likely that this phrase refers to a specific medical condition or theory related to the difficulty of treating certain substances or conditions in women's bodies due to the many methods or approaches that may be required. Without the original context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	The phrase "Unus ex earum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo" translates to "One of them is: that perhaps she is a maid" in English. This is a metaphorical expression and not a literal description of a medical condition or substance. In the context of medieval Arabic medicine, it's likely that this phrase refers to a specific medical condition or theory related to the age or stage of development of women's bodies. Without the original context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	The phrase "Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos" translates to "And secondly, because you do not find a woman who is willing to be examined by the physician when she is chaste, or from her children" in English. This is a metaphorical expression and not a literal description of a medical condition or substance. In the context of medieval Arabic medicine, it's likely that this phrase refers to a specific medical condition or theory related to the reluctance or refusal of women to undergo medical examinations or treatments. Without the original context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The phrase "Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu" translates to "Thirdly, because you do not find a woman who is well-versed in this art, particularly the operation with the hand" in English. This is a metaphorical expression and not a literal description of a medical condition or substance. In the context of medieval Arabic medicine, it's likely that this phrase refers to a specific medical condition or theory related to the lack of skilled or experienced female physicians who can perform certain medical procedures or treatments. Without the original context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth is the distance from the point of the stone: therefore it requires a deep cut, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If the necessity calls for that, then it is necessary to take a female physician, well-versed in her craft: and she is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you really need it, then seek out a pure physician, subtle, and a present midwife, well-versed in the art of women: or a woman who in this art hints at some part of the art: therefore make her present, and above all to her, that she may do everything as you have commanded her from your inquiry on the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, that is, if a woman is a virgin: then it is necessary to insert the finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If then she finds it, hold it with her own finger, and then command the midwife to insert her left hand into the infirm woman's vagina, and search for the stone after placing her thumb on the vagina, and compress it well.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then she finds the stone, then it is necessary to move it slowly from the orifice of the vagina downwards with all her might, until it comes out at the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should wet it on the opposite side of the infirm thigh at the root of the thigh, from whichever part is prepared for it, and feel for the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, and she should press upon it: and the first section should be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert the knitting needle on that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If then she feels the stone, then she should add to the section according to the proportion that the stone is going out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	You know that there are many kinds of stone species.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From this, you understand that it is a small but large one, gentle and rough, long, and round, with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, you know the species of this, as it is indicated to you by this above what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If you do not bleed, then add ground glass to the spot, and hold it for an hour until the blood is abscised.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone has passed: and make ready for you with the instruments I said in the removal of the stone in the viscera, so that you can assist with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If you do not bleed, and you know that the blood is expelled from the incised artery: then place a sponge on the spot, and tie it with a smooth bandage suitable to the size of the sponge: and do not forget this: and let go of the stone, and do not take it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the sharpness of the blood is subsided after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation: until the stone has passed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ Regarding the sectioning of the superficial water hernia.
Caput LXII.	Caput LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The water hernia is not a rind, except the aggregation of moisture in the white sifac which is under the covering of the testicle, and it is called the sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own little bag, which nature prepared for it in the part of the ovary, until it thinks that it is another ovum, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac which we said, and this is not made except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	This generation indeed of this branch is from the weakness that happens to the testicles, therefore this matter is poured onto them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it happens by striking on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or is its color diluted to yellowness, or is it reddish-brown, or black, or gray, and this is the one that is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the water aggregation is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white part that we said, then the apostema is round in length almost like the figure of a globe: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own proper part, then the apostema is round with the part of the thumb, and for this reason the man looks at it because it is something else.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white part, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When then you wish to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the apostema when it is introduced with a square instrument, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, by what goes out in the examination of the introduction, judge about that which is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When then we come to the care with iron, it is necessary for you to make a weak one first, so that if it is possible for the siphon to puncture it, and you see the body of that man full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then it will be raised on his back over the high but small thing, and place under it many sheets.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and command the attendant to sit on his right side, who extends his wife's face to one of two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to a part of the moist.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a dry sponge and scrape off the skin of the testicles from the middle all along, until near the loins: and make a section according to the equal distance of the line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white line comprehending: and examine it and observe, or cause it to depart thus, so that it leaves this one: and let your excoriation be such as leaves this one, from the part which hangs with the testicle more: and carefully examine with the excoriation according to the quantity that you are able.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then make a hole in the full white of the testicle with a wide piercing, and take out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two sections of the skin with the hairs, and extend the white to the upper part, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that it comprehends: and cut the white as possible for you to cut it, or with its wholeness, or piece by piece, especially the side of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not desire to examine closely, there is no security that water will not remain in the cutting.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if water comes out from its own skin at the time of your operation: then when you have finished the cutting of the white, reduce it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather the two sections of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as the other wounds until it is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find the white corrupted from blackness another: then it is necessary to bind the wounds that are suspended, being afraid of the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender, and take out the white: then care for that as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: cut therefore the other part equally according to what you have done in the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	If it is agreed that there will be one operation, then do this first: then clean the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert the dipped wool into oil or rose oil, and place another piece of wool on top that you dipped in wine and oil, and expand it over the two testicles, and observe the moisture: and place two doubled sheets on top, and they should be smooth: and tie them down with a ribbon that is bound in this manner.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two sheets are used, and they are tied together, and filled with the carminative powder, according to this similarity: and the ends which are to be placed on the shoulder are either wet wool: and they are gathered together with a narrowing in the armpit: and one end is taken up from the shoulder up to the back, and the other end is taken up from the part of the chest: and two ends are taken up on the two legs below, and two ends on the two thighs, and they are gathered together throughout the armpit.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with the caustic at the place of the section with iron: and it is, as you take the caustic with a fine sword, and follows the skin of the testicles: and it is burned, according to what we have said: until when it is withdrawn with white wax containing water: then take the caustic, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The letters of Greek are similar.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then the drill is made with it, and it is burned until the entire moisture escapes.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the wax with threads, and scrape it with a fine caustic burned: and cut it according to what is possible for you, until all of it is removed.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful not to touch it with fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	You should perform this operation as it is more beneficial, longer in duration than the flow of blood, and better than the operation with section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	However, if there is opposition in the section, or in the hot aposteme of cauterization, or in the flow of blood, or something else: then you should treat what causes the opposition with the curative measure that corresponds to it, as was previously stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	However, if the weak person is timid and does not expect anything more than this operation due to its horror, then you should administer the puncture according to what I will tell you: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by you that the signification I mentioned about the water-like ramus is wet, then you should make the weak person sit on the raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then make a puncture on the wet ramus in the lower part of his body with the side of the sandpaper: and place the puncture according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place the abdomen on the place, and tie it, and let it go so that the remaining water flows out: then care for it until it heals the wound.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	However, if the opposition of water in the hour of the puncture is because the white cloth makes it in the wound opening and prevents the exit of water: then you should insert a finger into the wound, or an instrument with which water is drawn from hydropic ointments, whose form precedes: or add to the operation of the wound temporarily.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it accumulates, then it will return in the same way, and the weak person will pass through his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	The care of fleshy meats.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You know that in the section above this, there is a cause of harm in many arrangements due to fear.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that the release from the therapeutic care of this.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation in it and the kind of stitches used.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many things happen to stitches in the bodies from which the testicles are made: and this is due to many causes, that is to say.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from the excessive sharpness or acidity which is poured into the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or by tapping.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the stitch is according to the color of the body, and it does not find pain in it: and it is a deep stitch.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone stitch, whose color is black, and there is no sense in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is made from the nodulation of the arteries and their inflammation, as has already been remembered by me: or from the inflammation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, that which is from them by inflammation of the arteries, is known by the arrangement of the stitch when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it does not need to touch it directly.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which is made from the inflammation of the veins, is not discharged from it when you compress it with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that a section will be made above this kind, and above other fleshy parts: and it is that it separates the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the gut upwards, and take out the stitch with a white silk thread: and free the suspender from the gut, and tie it: and incise the suspender after you have freed it from all parts of the parts of the body.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then blood clots have formed with these newborn flesh, then it is necessary to draw out the blood and burn it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something in the funnel and something in the vessel, then it is necessary to free all of that adhesion and burn it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however, the birth of flesh is in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to burn all of it and draw out the blood as I have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then mix the wool with olive oil and rose oil, and then care for it with the rest of the care until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Regarding the care of grapes, which is with vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Head LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Ulcers are formed by a certain inflammation, similar to the boil, with the softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult to walk over the weak movement and exercise, and to walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment is fear, because of that which precedes the rememoration.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Indeed, it is necessary to say the operation on her according to what they have done for the first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore that it is necessary to make the weak one sit on the raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then drive the suspensory of the testicles down to the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the oils that are near to the woman: and hold it with another helper, and extend it with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a sharp side slicing of the soap in the direction of the woman, until they are seen.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrub all parts as I have said to you in the extraction of the Arteries which are in the times.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards, tie a thread in them, making it double the length of the original thread, and tie it again in the first places where the seeds occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry it in the middle section of a straight line according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from the moist and corrupted waste materials.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then attend to the thigh with the care of the other wounds, in which you wish to generate healthy ones, so that the waters which nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not harmful for this reason.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	If, however, the seeds occur in all the waters, then it is necessary to remove them from the testicles with the waters: so that they may not be deprived of nutrients due to the incision, and they may not become wasted or scorched, and there may be no inflammation with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ On the care of the Intestinal Ramus.
Caput LXV.	Head 56.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The exit of this Ramus is from the section which occurs in the wide part above the belly in the part of the groin from the large veins.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach, or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds of ruptures occur from many causes: either from percussion, or a sudden fall, or a loud noise, or the leakage of a noxious thing, and such like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is a postero-inferior apostema equal to the depth: therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	When the sign of this is seen when it is sectioned from the sifah, it causes a severe pain to occur immediately from its beginning: and it is a diverse apostema, appearing on the skin near by: and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and the course of its journey to the exterior sifah.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it leaves with the intestine zirbum: and this is called the small intestine, and zirbia: and sometimes it is formed with moisture.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs into the intestine feces, and is retained there: and it is dangerous for the weak: because it causes a severe pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the kinds of this disease with iron, there is fear: therefore it is necessary to avoid this case in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of the operation is to reduce the weak one, so that she reduces the intestine with her own hand to the interior cavity of its own, if it obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it will be raised up on its neck over your hands: and you will stretch out its legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and dry the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then sew two stitches in the two cuts, according to what is needed to open the cut with them: and the cut should be according to the quantity that is possible, so that it may go out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the siphak, and that which is under the skin of the testicles, until it becomes hard from all parts: then insert your thumb into the one that follows the testicle, into the one that is between the album and the sifach which is under the skin of the wi, and between the sifachs according to, and absolutely adheres to the posterior part of the wi.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then I sew with my right hand to the inner layer of the testicles: and when this is extended, I put almond oil on top with my left hand: and I extract blood with the ointment that is at the section's part: and I command the assistant to extend it upwards: and you untie the adhesion that is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers to make sure nothing from the intestine is mixed into the hard white ointment.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if I find something in it: then push it down towards the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the bag where a thick thread is made from ten threads: and insert it at the last layer of ointment, which is the skin that follows the section on the bottom of the testicles: then cut off the ends that stick out until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then lay some of them on top of others with a figure like the cross, and bind them with it, because it is a ligament under the skin of the testicles that nothing from the waters can reach them to send something to them: so as not to get burned by the heat.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place the second ligament again, according to the first one, longitudinally further than two fingers from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And then release the two ligaments from the skin under the testicles in proportion to the size of the finger: and cut off the rest according to the roundness, and take out the oil.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then scrape off the lower part of the skin section, from which the blood and pus run, as we have mentioned earlier.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool that has been dipped in oil, and place it on the thigh: and apply the ligament that we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	When the white wax is cauterized, after making the incision, I fear the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligament, until it falls on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case is delayed, then it should be embroccated with warm water: and place that which I mentioned on top of it, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then, care for the thigh with the remaining wound care, until it is cared for.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Chapter on Wet Swelling.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this swelling, no one has been seen who was bold enough to apply iron over the treatment of it.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And at first they said that it happens as we have described in the swelling which is with the vein.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to swell the thigh after cutting it below with ease: then dry in the middle, and care for the end with that which opens it, until they fall: and care for the thigh, according to what I said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Chapter on Dislocation in the Thighs.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 77.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When the dislocation in the thighs happens, as I said, and the place is examined, and nothing has come down from the intestines to the testicles: and if it has come down, it is not much, and it returns in every hour: but if it prolongs that time, a fissure is added to the wax, until the intestines descend into the wax.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the wax, which I said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because it is extended wax: then it is softened, and the place is stitched, and it is examined.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with cauterization, as I have mentioned before in its report.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	When it comes to treating wounds with iron, it should be done in this manner: let the weak lie on their back with your hands on either side of them.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then, clean the wound site of the ruptured stitch and make it project, sectioning it lengthwise according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then, tie the alifeck and the ones below it until the album sifach, which is the one following it, is tightened.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then, take the rope and place it on top of the projecting wound site from the stitch, and press it down to the depth of the veins.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then, tie two points of projection at the ends of the rope from the stitch, and connect them with a single suture of one with the other: then remove the end of the rope.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alifeck entirely, nor tighten the skin, nor anything else, as I have shown you in the treatment of intestinal ramifications.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then, treat this wound according to the treatment of the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you sew, clean it, and restore the skin, until it is healed.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The sifach tightens, and does not add to the projection of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	The cauterium is better in this place: for it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ On the softening of the testicle skin.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because the flesh that is between them is also softened, and its appearance is made unpleasing.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, to make the weak lie on their back with the entire softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he gathers the two lips with the suture: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin from three or four sutures, or four, and then make a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then he makes an incision between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then he cares for the curing of the other wounds until it is well and the threads fall.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ Regarding Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Head LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You know that castration is prohibited by our law: and for this reason I did not include it in the book of this, because it was not necessary to remember it, except for two ways.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	The first is, that the physician may know when asked about it, and know the treatment of the one who suffers from it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	The other is, that we often require castration of certain animals for our sake, such as sheep, apes, and gats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by cutting and division.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by attrition, the operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles of it are softened and relaxed, and hang down: then we gently rub them with your hand, until they are resolved and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by cutting and division, it is necessary to hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspender, and dry it over all the cut section one, until when two wounds come out: then make an incision after you have cleaned it both, and do not leave anything on it above the suture which is under the skin of the wound.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	This method of castration is better because it is done by spaying: for spaying may leave something in the testicles, therefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	¶ Regarding the care of hermaphrodites in two modes.
Caput LXX.	Head LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodites from the male are in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	Their virility is apparent because it appears that they follow the pattern of a woman, with a figure like a woman's, in which there are hairs, and sometimes they run urine from the place that is in the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is a single species, and it is like a woman's pubic hair above the testicles as if they were fully developed, prominent on the outside: of which one is like a priapus of the penis, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	The treatment of the three species, two from males and one from women, is necessary because it is necessary to add flesh to these impressions until they disappear.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then care for them with the care of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second species of men, from which urine issues that is in the testicles, there is no operation, nor is its treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	¶ Regarding the incision of the Tent, and the fleshy parts in women's wives.
Caput LXXI.	Head LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The Tent may be added to the natural part, until it becomes unsightly and shameful: and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it expands like in men, and reaches orgasm.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore it is necessary to hold back the excess of the Tent with your hand, or with a blade, and incise: and not least in the incision, especially in the deep root: so that there is no flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then attend to the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, flesh that is born in the opening of the womb, until it fills up the whole: and perhaps it may go forth to the outside according to the likeness of the tail: and for this reason some call the first kind of lameness caudata.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore it is necessary that we should treat it in the same way as we treat the fever, and attend to it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	¶ Regarding the treatment of a hernia, which is not ruptured in a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Caput LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Hernia is, that it is not a rupture in the woman, or that it is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	An accidental hernia is from the disease that precedes it: and this itself is either added to the flesh that is born, or to the subtle membrane, or to the spice: and it is either in the deep part of the womb, or in its sides, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it prevents from coition and impregnation, and parturition, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is made by the observation of the midwife, if the poverty is apparent near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with the thumb.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the poverty is from the subtle membrane, and it is near the two lips: then immediately tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place on the two lips two pieces of cloth.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and the woman should be on her back with her legs extended.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength, until the subtle membrane is torn apart, and the poverty is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and dip it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman wear the wool all day, so that the spot does not harden with another kind of gum.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however it is a wart, then it should be scraped with a sharp knife: in that case, let it be torn off with the edge of a leaf from the myrtle tree.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however it is a gristle from the flesh, then hang it up with cords, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines which settle without being bitter, like acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus gathered with the kidney.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply a gauze from the lead, so that the wound does not harden quickly, keep it for some days: and apply linen from dry flax, then finish the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when it comes to the birth of flesh from other wombs, it should be treated like this: until the cancerous growth is not apostema, which is in the womb, there should be no contradiction with iron altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	¶ About the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor red in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	¶ Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Indeed hemorrhoids are the openings of the veins of the female genitals, until much blood flows from them frequently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore they become large, they are called hemorrhoids: and as I have already said in the division of their species, and signs of them, and I will say now which of them receive treatment and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I therefore say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and are not visible to the senses: then there is no treatment with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	The medical procedures that are performed on the openings of the womb where the senses fall are these that are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary to bring the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the woolen cloth with needles, or with a rough nap, and cut them from the roots of their own.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then apply the aloe to them over the flow of blood from one of the cuts without biting: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thistle, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then pull her feet towards the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If she persisted in the flow of blood, then make her sit in a decoction of sumach and the bark of ginger, and the galls, and similar to them.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take flour of barley, and make it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If then the blood is discharged with it, it is good: and if not, make the wounds stick to the back and the breasts, without biting.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tar, or the juice of arnglossis, or the juice of the leaves of the aloe, that is, the sharper the wine of Pontic, and make it stick to the lobe.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When then the sty is quiet, take care of the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	However, the red blood is similar to the hair of the aloe, and has a sharp appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut what appears from it, according to what I said in the theil equally: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Section on the perforation of the Exiturae which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 724.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	In the matrix, there are many types of ulcers, such as cancer, stone ulcers, wounds, scarred, and pickled ones, that is, herpes, abscesses, hemorrhoids, fistulas, and piles, and gangrene, and hot ulcers.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all these diseases and their species, signs, and treatments in division: it is necessary to say in this book about hot ulcers that occur in the matrix, when they are from ulcers that are drawn from healthy ones, and you want to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary for you to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the ulcers is sharp when it touches itself, and flame, and fever: and you see it turn red: if it falls on it, then do not rush with the perforation of it: and treat it with it as it increases over maturation, until when it rests, the sharpness of the accident disappears.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary for you to make the woman sit on the seat which has two chairs, and reclines, or is placed on her back, and brings her feet together to a lower part of the veins: and her hips should be expanded, and places her arms under her knees, and lies with both limbs convenient for it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the left side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the matrix is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes to those that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument that you see with the radio deep in the matrix of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than deep in the matrix, and harms the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is not deep enough, then you should place cloths over the surface of the deep mattress: to prevent the entire instrument from entering the deep mattress. And it is necessary that the vernix caseosa, which runs in the instrument, comes from the upper side: and it should hold the instrument, and turn the vernix caseosa, until the deep mattress is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When then the incision appears and is touched with the hand, and it is soft and smooth: then it should be cut off at its own head with a flannel side.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When then the pus escapes, then it should be placed on the inner flesh roll with rose oil: or with virgin olive oil, in which there is some stipticity: and place the fleece, and take out the section from the deep mattress.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place outside on the mattress, and on the clean inner fleece that is submerged in water, in which the boils are small.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be cared for after two days with the ointment that suits it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the mattress and inner flesh are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or long aristolochia is boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the inner flesh is hidden within the mattress, then it should be prevented from treatment with iron, indeed with the treatment that we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	In the Art of Midwifery, how they treat living children according to a figure not natural from above.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to first recognize the natural figure of labor.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	When a woman is bound tight to the lower parts of her body, and desires to smell the air that is above her, and touches what is above her that is on her own part, and hastens the exit of the embryo: then you know that this part is according to the natural figure, and its exit is over its head, and the rest after it: whether suspended, or hanging from the umbilicus.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary that he be bound tightly to his belly, so that the embryo may come out quickly and easily.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	When it comes out over his head, the rest comes with it, and is cleansed by the good cleansing of those superfluities.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if there is anything beyond this part, it is unnatural and unpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus comes out over its own feet, and goes forth from the body of the foetus before its head, and feet, and hand, or foot: or goes forth from its head and hand: or goes forth from the abdomen: and perhaps it turns over on its chest, and such like from unpraiseworthy figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to guard against error and deception: and I am showing you all the figures, and what is the ingenuity in them, and what they signify by that, and how it stands over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out over its own head by its own exit, and it is placed over the woman, and it becomes difficult for him to give birth, and you see his virtue already weakened: then make him sit on a seat, or women hold him, and a pillow wet with vinegar, and with warm oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts her finger into her own small thumb, and feels along with it the fetal part, and moistens it with her own nail, until the fluid that is in it from moisture has curdled: and she presses on the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If the fetus does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be bathed in Greek mucilage with olive oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then she should press on him after the bath, and make him swallow it with a spoon, and hold his mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will immediately be born.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus are born first, then it is necessary to gently reduce them with difficulty.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If she does not obey during the insertion, then place the woman on a bed, and raise her feet: then press the bed on the ground: and hold her so that she does not fall during the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut off the hands, and take out the remaining fetus: and tie the hand of the fetus with a cloth, and take it out with equality, for it will also come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The end of the embryo on its own feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its own feet, then it is necessary to push them up: then gently turn the fetus: and then hold it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then she should take one of its feet, and extend it slowly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out until the hips, then make him swallow it with a spoon, and make him swallow it with difficulty: for he will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with the one we mentioned, then gently reduce the fetus: until you place it according to the natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	He will then go out easily.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If the whole thing is prohibited when he goes out: then take some almond oil, and gum resin, and water that has been dissolved; percuss everything in the mortar with good blows; then line it up with him, and below his vapor.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make it sit in hot water until the anesthesia takes effect.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that his lower parts are already heated, then apply some myrrh oil to him, and put him on the bed.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has held the anesthesia for one hour, then make him sit on the bed.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and draw up his nose and mouth, and press on the lower part of his vapor with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For fire will go out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit of the fetus over the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When he goes out according to this form, then insert his hands gradually into the introit.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will lean over her neck, and her feet will hang down below; and she will lie on the bed with her hands folded.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press on his vapor gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then take out what is under her feet from the pubic hairs, until it is ready in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not go out, then take her feet and move them with a strong movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press on what is above the anesthesia gradually, until the fetus ascends to the higher parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert his hands gradually, and press on the fetus, and tell the woman to hold it tight until the fetus goes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The infant is suspended horizontally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The wrist is being reduced.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce the wrist, then she should be helped to walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and strike her hips with a sudden blow.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment you prepared from mucilages that you have.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she takes it well, then make her sit down on the seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then carefully reduce the wrist and make the infant equal according to its natural figure, and make her sternute and tell her to wrap herself up and go out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The infant's face is turned towards the back of its mother's shoulder.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the infant's hand, then gently roll it and make it easy.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equal, then put on top of its thigh that we mentioned from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then tell her to gently move.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you do this, then make her sit down on the seat and tell her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then tell her to wrap herself up: and make her sternute with the cord.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The infant is ready with its face on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it comes down to the mother's mouth according to this way with the second one, then cut the second one with your nail, until it jumps out of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is hung over the face of the infant and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it will not hold on, and it will die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus to the inside, until you place it according to what is appropriate: and tell the woman to wrap herself several times: for he himself will go out by the left side.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	Exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are born in large numbers: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five indeed is a thing outside of nature, and they do not live completely: and it contains them, whatever they may be multiplied, after the first one: and they are separated by a scissors, distinguishing between them tied in the umbilicus of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like the one fetus goes out by a natural exit, easily: and they go out by an unpleasant exit, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult to find at the time of parting, and they go to that which we have said in figures, then take care of them as we have said: and it is because of the stealthy one, and does what it does with facility and slowness, and thinks according to all the figure with the one who prepares for him from his own intellect to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remembrance of this that is formed in the womb from embryos, and they are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes it is formed in the womb by one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight, and nine, and ten: and I have already heard from a woman who aborted seven and fifteen, all the ones that were formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which has been done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore this whole thing should be in the knowledge of Midwives.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will satisfy him with that similar one: therefore he lays it alongside with that, what is appropriate.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	¶ On the Extraction of the Foetus from a Dead Birth.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are treating a dead fetus with the medicine that I mentioned in the division, and it does not go out, and you force it to be operated on by hand, then it is necessary to consider this.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of sound constitution and has not had any of the accidents that are feared for her, then it is necessary for the woman to be laid on a bed, on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised: and she should be held by two people, or placed on the bed, so that her body is not extracted at the time of the extraction of the foetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then hydrate the mother's bones with soft oils, such as olive oil and high-grade mucilage, and linen seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hands with these oils and mucilages, and then insert it into the mother's womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she will ask where that place is in which the fetus makes knots, and where it is convenient for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its own head, then tie the knots in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its shoulder, or in the nearby costal bones, and under the hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	However, if the descent is on its feet, then in the chest, and in its ribs in the middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary for her to hold the knot with her right hand: and she should place the fetus in the space between the left fingers of her hand: and she inserts it with her hand easily, and ties the knot in some of those places that I mentioned, until it reaches the womb.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he forms another hook on the opposite side, or a third one if needed, so that the contraction is equal and does not lean towards a part.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it is extended equally, and should not be an extension only on the straight line, but should move to all parts so that its exit can be as desired, just as happens with a tooth during its removal.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary for there to be something between them so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If it is held from that part, then the midwife should apply some oiled fingers to it and introduce them from that side so that they can rotate with what is being held.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If it goes to the part of the fetus, then the hooks should be turned to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus has gone out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If the hand goes out before the other, and it is not possible to bring it back because of its contraction: then it should be wrapped over it with a cloth.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then remove it when it has gone out completely, either by cutting it off at the joint, or in the elbow: and it is necessary to do the same with the other hand, and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or a contraction occurs in its exit, or water is gathered in its head: then it should introduce between the fingers of Spatumile a thorn, and find the head with it and extract the water: or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the head that is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is large-headed in nature, then it should let it out with a salve: or take it out with the misdach, as I have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then he draws bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head is withdrawn and it is wrapped around the shoulder: then it is found, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	However, if it does not wrap around, it does not obey the exit: then cut off the head in pieces, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If it is lower in the chest, or there is moisture in it: then it is necessary to pierce it until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	However, if the fetus is above its own feet: then the attraction of it is easy, and the direction of it to the mother's bone is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	However, if it is wrapped around the chest or the heart: then it is necessary to take it out with the cloth that you covered over your hand: and find the chest, or the heart, until the moisture that is in it flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	However, if the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the midwife inserts her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore, if the bone of the mother is open: then she inserts her hand into the mother's bone deeply, and searches for the head with it, and draws it out with her fingers up to the mother's bone: then she inserts a pin or two pins into it and draws it out with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	However, if the bone of the mother is wrapped around: because of the hot gangrene that occurs to it: then it is not necessary for her to labor over it, but rather she should at that time give an effusion of watery and slimy things: and she should apply a plaster: and she should sit in warm and moistening waters.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	However, if the fetus is on its own side: then it is possible for it to be equalized: and at that time the thing that I said about the fetus is given to it.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it will be done in sections and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary to hold nothing back from the second part entirely inside.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what I said in hot apostemats which occur in the maternal parts.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a flow of blood, then it should descend into hot stimulating waters and the remainder of the treatment should be administered.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose womb the foetus had died, and then she was impregnated on top of it with another, and later that other foetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happens to her after a long time of hot application in the belly button, and it becomes inflated until it is opened, and she begins to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I am called to care for her, and I have been treated for a long time: and the knee is not solidified.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I have placed on top of it from some strong emplastrums of attraction: and the bone has been moved out of its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days have passed, and another bone has been moved out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was surprised then, because there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought that they were from the bones of the dead foetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I found the bone and extracted many bones, a woman existing in better positions of hers: and she has already done so for a long time, and sends out a little pus from its place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not firmly hold this strange thing unless there is knowledge in it, and an aid to it that the artist-doctor uses with his hand from the treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	¶ About the necessary forms of instruments in the extraction of the foetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the Straightener, as it is called in the books, where there are equal parts in the two ends of the two logs.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	Indeed, this Vertical should be softer than the Straightener: and it should be made of ebony or basswood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the thickness of all woods should be almost like two fingers: and the edge of each is almost a finger, and the length of each is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two woods are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already become firm in both, whose length is half a palm and less, and the width of each is almost two fingers, or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it opens with them when you turn over the two Verticals.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Vertical that opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to this, softer and longer.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made of ebony or basswood, according to the model of the claw.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	Indeed, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see above: and the length of all the addition is almost a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	And when you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, with her legs hanging down, and leave the one that is between her thighs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined together into the womb: and you are holding the end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with the claws, equally according to the amount that you want to take from the opening of the womb, until the midwife wants to do it.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of vertigo is different from what the ancients called the form of impelling, by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almidace, by which the great head is cut: and it is similar to a saw, with teeth at the extremities, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made to be closed, as the form of saw makes, as you see, with teeth like those of a serpent's, by which it is both cut and closed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almidace by which the small head is cut.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of Uncinus has one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of Uncinus has two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of saw with teeth like those of a serpent's, by which the fetal head is cut.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatumilis has two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatumilis also for the shoulders.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	This instrument will be used for everything, and the more they multiply their kinds, and the more prepared they are at the craftsman's, the better it is for the operation of its own kind, and higher among men because of its quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise this instrument, lest it be prepared at your side.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For it is inexcusable the need of theirs.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	¶ About the extraction of the second child.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second child is held at childbirth, then it is necessary to use strong remedies so that it can retain its heat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it snort by giving it a condi. And tighten your hand over its mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then it goes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take the bowl, and perforate a hole in the cover: and put into it opening leaves of matricaria, such as calamus, rosemary, and chamomile, and sage, and linen, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and put them under water, and then place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a bolus of barley over the covering of the flask, and place another end in the matrix's socket: and hold it until it wets the socket to the matrix's union.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it hiss as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second part will then proceed with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	However, if it remains after this treatment and does not proceed: then advise the obstetrician to immerse her hand in olive oil or high-alkaline mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should introduce it into the uterus and ask about it with that Second part.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she finds it, then take it and extend it slightly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	However, if it is anchored in the deep socket of the matrix, then she should introduce her hand according to what we have described until she finds the Second part and withdraws it slightly according to the straight line, so that the matrix does not fall due to the strong attraction: in fact, it should be turned with ease to the right and left side, and then added in proportion to the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	The matrix obeys at this point and is drawn out and draws away from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the socket of the matrix is compressed as we have mentioned: treat it with the hiss and with the ointment of the flask with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	However, if she does not proceed with all that we have mentioned, then be careful not to tire from the repeated extractions on her.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed, it is necessary to bind what goes out of the matrix's socket to the woman's bed.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then apply a bandage to it with Tetraphthalmo.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	The Tetraphthalmo will rot it in days and dissolve, and proceed.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	When it rots, it emits a bad smell that reaches the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suffumigations suitable for this should be given.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some have even experienced the use of nasturtium and dried figs for suffumigations.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument used to suffume a woman during the second month and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	A censer similar to an almsbox or a lamp is made, and its wide end is placed over the fire. The suffumigation is placed on the prunes, and it is held until the suffumigation is consumed, and then another one is taken.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Regarding the treatment of Ani that are not pierced.
Caput LXXIX.	Head LXXIX. (This seems to be a reference number, but without additional context, it's difficult to provide a translation.)
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their Ani are not pierced, which the poor woman has already made small. (This sentence seems to be discussing the practice of piercing ears for jewelry or adornment.)
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife should pierce it with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp Spatumil: and let her take care that the hand does not touch it. (This sentence seems to be providing instructions for piercing a child's ear.)
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it freshly scented wool and oil. (This sentence seems to be providing instructions for applying the suffumigation to the child's ear.)
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ungreased cloth until it is cured. (This sentence seems to be providing instructions for caring for the pierced ear.)
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	However, if you fear that it is poor, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and it will be taken out when the child wants to cry. (This sentence seems to be providing instructions for treating a poorly pierced ear.)
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it already happens that the poorness of the Ani is also due to the consolidation of the wound or the stitching. (This sentence seems to be discussing the causes of poorly pierced ears.)
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is therefore necessary that this consolidation be allowed to settle, and then it should be treated with what we have said from the treatment and splint.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	¶ On the Treatment of Fistulas that Occur in the Lower Part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 88.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodules and Enlargements which occur near the deformed anus: or in a single part of the body: it is either a single fistula or more than one.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodule becomes old, it is opened and white, moisture runs from it, or a fine pus comes out.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating fistulas are recognized by what comes out with the evacuation, and the moisture, when it is used for weak evacuation: and perhaps it comes out from those wombs.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are fistulas when they are in a space that is penetrating up to the vesica, and up to the female generative organ.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating up to the joint of the thigh, and up to the nodule of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that on which is known that the fistula is penetrating up to the anus, even though it is not penetrating, it is, as you insert your thumb into the anus: and you insert a thin tentacle into the fistula from the air, or from iron, when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is tortuosity in it, then insert a tentacle into it from the splint, or a spear from the hairs of horses, until you feel the tentacle, or the spear in your thumb.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, and nothing comes out from the opening, neither moisture, nor wombs as I have said, then you know that it is not penetrating: therefore, to the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	When the fistula reaches until to the bladder or to the urinary passage: then its meaning is the exit of the urine from there, and it is forbidden for this so that the place may heal with the medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is that goes through until to the hip joint, or to the head of the thigh: then this is a sign that it tends to go out as far as there, if not there is not tortuosity up to the hip: and I find pain in the surrounding part, and that pus always comes out of it: and that it does not like any treatment, nor does it solidify with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these fistulas that go through completely, there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is labor and uselessness to her, from a foolish physician, under whom she is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In those that are not through and not old, there is hoped for cure with a poultice: according to what I tell you, and I have already proved: and it is that she is weak between your hands on her back: and lift her legs above her thighs of herself, and her hips are inclined towards her belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then let her insert a lead or air probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where it tends to go out.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if she feels it weak around the anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your finger to indicate in the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If then you feel with your finger that it has gone through by itself detected, except that you feel between your finger and the adjacent part or flesh, then you know certainly that it is through: therefore you do not labor in it, because it is not its cure, as I said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they say that it heals in some men's flesh and from the medication that is hoped for, it is that a small cauterium of fire according to the size of the fistula is, as has been said, and you insert it into the fistula until it goes out around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then do this twice or three times until you know that all of those added flesh has become ash-like, for these are similar to the feathers of a bird's wing.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then take care of that with linseed oils wrapped in honey, until those ash-like flesh comes out: then take care of it with ointments that make and strengthen flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is cured, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be cured with another treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out tried, and does not stop until the tip of your finger, which is in the anus, and is between them and the sponge made from flesh, or sifac: and you see the fistula following the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you wipe with what has been tried until it stops, where the tip of the fistula is wet, and the fistula is liberated and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those ash-like flesh that is similar to the feathers of a bird's wing, so that nothing remains of it.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if blood does not flow from you, and dissolves between you and the operation that is done on it: then it is better that it happens, and more beneficial to your diet, to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For cauterization with fire unites good habits, adds ash-like substance to the flesh, and promotes the separation of blood and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then take care of that with linseed oils wrapped in honey, or with crushed leaves, until the pus comes out, and those ash-like flesh goes into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with hardened ointments that generate tough flesh, and these are the remedies in which there is stipitation and excitation of the skin.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When they are eaten, then they are already healed: and there is no need for repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has become quite inflamed up to its depth, and has extended beyond the surplus of the body: then insert your thumb into the anus, and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If then you feel a test, and between you and it there is a layer of fat or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation on that part, except according to your trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	What is this, that it is administered in that part one third of a drachm: or whether it is used to cauterize it, as we said: or let it pass until you have obtained coitu of it, so that it may be possible for you to insert your finger into it, and treatment from the proximate part.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the section, so that you do not cut the firm hand of the anus, and there may be a superfluous exit of feces without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat that as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or elongate that layer of fat or flesh, and cleanse it after you have removed it as far as the anus, as we said, or when you try, or with another sharp-pointed instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh that is in the section, until you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then dare to restore the wound of the whole with the section, and the opening above where it is consolidated: and let there remain an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be less on the weakest part.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	When you wish to introduce a fistula, do so in this manner: when you insert your tent into the fistula, it is located in the side of the anus, near the surface of the body, with the skin and the edge of the anus. Then, take the perforated end, which resembles a lance-headed arrow, that is, the prepared curette, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert the thread into it, wound around five times, approximately.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the tent with the thread into the fistula until cohesion is achieved.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is possible to pass the thread through the edge of the anus internally, then extract the thread from that opening: in such a way that you insert your thumb into the anus, and extract the end of the thread, and gather the two ends together: string them together, and leave it for one or two days: and as much as the thread penetrates into the flesh, hold it tightly, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls off and drops out: then care for the wound, until it heals and becomes sound.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If the fistula opening is not possible to pass through: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless there is much depth.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not have a hand to make it so as not to pierce the fistula.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then make it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the Spatumilis sawn thread, whose edge is sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not penetrate what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	¶ Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incisions: and care for the cuts.
Caput LXXXI.	Head 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are varices in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are within the anus, similar to charcoal or prunes: or they are almost like pieces of salt.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them are small and large ones: and blood always runs from them, it is uniform, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are few in number, and are due to moisture, from which water of lemon color runs, or a little blood flows continuously: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of those that are inside the anus is to be as one would treat a weak person, and it is expressed until the anus is ejected, and the wounds appear before you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend them with gut: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them down at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they are not held down with gut, due to the moisture and their own softness: then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a comb made of woolen flax, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and put some warm lotions on them after cutting them, so they may stay in place at the cauterization site.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what is written in the chapter of cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not submit to the exit of the stool, then apply a weak ointment in which there is a small bite, so that it may be applied with what is inside the anus, and it will yield willingly when it expresses itself as weak.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, on the other hand, they are external to the anus, then their removal is easy and straightforward: you can capture them with your nail or with a razor, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them as we have said, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if one dislikes the cut with iron, then it is necessary to apply a suture to them according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a piece of thread and insert it into the anus.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull out the warts from above, and make them penetrate with the point of the knife into the root of it from the other side: and thread the two ends of the thread with the point of the knife in the lower part, and let them be widely apart; and tighten the warts' suture firmly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread and pull out the knife.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the warts, and let out one of them: do not let it run over excessive blood from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then put a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or olive oil on the anus, and place it there: and tell the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it out until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the warts fall off, take care of them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	¶ On the Care of Fissures:
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Indeed they often occur due to the dryness of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become large and do not respond to medicine: then it is necessary to moisten them with salt points or with your nail, until they become wet, and remove the upper layer of wood that prevents them from consolidating.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them until they consolidate according to what is appropriate.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate: then repeat them with a more vigorous reason, until they bleed much, and then care for them, until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	The treatment of Almirmar for relapsing ulcers and non-relapsing ulcers, and antiseptics and ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is only a round node according to the color of the body, similar to the head wrapped around: it is made throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it happens from these that pain occurs during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it should be cut off what is wrapped around and held with thorns, or with a razor, and it should be rooted out from its own root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what is said in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the ants of dry ones, one is the prominence of a small, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often happen in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	The treatment of it is to extend the ants and make it larger, or to pull it up with a thread from silk: or with hair until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is said in the fire, or with sharp medicine: and already the ants of relapsing ones and non-relapsing ones are removed, and not relapsing ones with the instrument that I will say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	However, ant is also a small, rough, large, crawling on the surface of the body, diving into the cold water: and when it finds it, it feels in it similar to the sting of the ant, and it happens throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	The treatment for this is to take a quill from the goose or a strong, tough quill from the duck. Then place this quill on the formic acid, until the loop of the quill is fully covered by its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then roll your hand with the quill, until the part that is in the circumference of the formic acid is removed. Then place the quill in deep flesh, and remove the formic acid from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with a quill of copper or iron, in this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	The quill should be drawn up to the height of the formic acid, so that it is covered by the grasp of the hand and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize the formic acid according to what was said about cauterizing Atheil in Chapter 10 on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Regarding the forms of instruments that are used to treat diseases of the liver, and the remedy for the stomach, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When Clister is made from silver or gold, or from fused or hammered copper or iron.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is given to the treatment of young children should be small, and for those whose livers are weak or painful, so too should their Clister.
Clistere magnum.	Large Clister.
Cistere paruum.	Small Clister.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The head of the quill, that is, where the uter is tied, should be wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinctness so that it fits the anus as you see, and the lower end which goes into the anus should be surd, that is, not open, gentle, soft, drawing towards subtlety: and there should be two openings on one side of it, and one opening on the other side.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The size of the foramen should be according to the size of the teeth, and smaller in the middle, and it should be in which medicines are placed from animal flesh: or from the fur of a rabbit, which is according to the form of a small badger: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be hollowed out by many holes as it rotates, and there should be a space that is between the size of all the teeth.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert a thread firmly into those holes, which is from ten threads or about it, and gather it with the milk like that of a badger.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	And when the milk is placed in it, it should be tied at the head with a clister between two distinct firm constrictions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then tie it with that.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of a circle as depicted in this hole.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	However, the quality of tying it with that is: so that it fills the milk, or animal flesh from medicine, which is heated according to the amount of tolerance of the weak: and be careful not to make it hot or cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak should be placed on its back, and its legs should be raised upwards: and then place under it an inthaan, that is, a layer of skin over which humans lie, or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the end of the clister with oil, or with gum, or with French mucilage, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the nurse should take the milk with both hands of herself at the same time, and express it with force, until all that is in the clister is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then take out the clister, and raise the weak legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine considers it to be an end, then it should hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more fatal in the operation.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If you, however, apply it to the solutions of diseases of the bodily fluids, and hasten its exit, then repeat the bandage until it heals.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful apostemata, then a thin bandage, soft and flexible, made from the same plasters that children are dressed with, should be used.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of the thin bandage over which it should be tightly applied to the skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	¶ On the treatment of head wounds without fracturing the bones.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head LXXXIIII. (This is likely a reference to a specific chapter or section in the text, but without more context, it's difficult to provide a meaningful translation.)
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in division about the treatment of wounds that were suitable for the book, and I will now tell you the treatment of these wounds with my hand and with medicines according to the complement. (This sentence seems to be a transition or introduction to the following text.)
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say then that wounds are diversified according to the way they are made and according to the place where the wound falls. (This sentence is explaining the classification of wounds based on their cause and location.)
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, the wounds which are made often are like those made by a falling stone: or by a sword's edge, or by knives; or by a blow with a lance, or with wood, or with an arrow; and such like things from many things. (This sentence is providing examples of common causes of wounds.)
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, wounds which are made according to the place of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the breast, or the belly, or the thigh: and such like wounds in those parts. (This sentence is explaining that wounds can also be classified based on their location on the body.)
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	I am telling about the treatment of some wounds, so that I can put this reasoning and rule over other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: for the reminder of the composer does not fit at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say then.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple head wound occurs, and there is no fracture of the bone: then consider if it is from a fall of a stone, or similar, and has only scratched the skin: and it is a large wound, and fear for the worst outcome from hot applications: then immediately, and thecephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay this: and remove it from the blood according to the quantity of its strength: if it does not prevent anything from phlebotomy, especially if it is blood that is coming out of a small wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And the phlebotomy should be on the opposite side of the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let him beware of being swollen, and full, and of eating heavy food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If it however prohibits anything, then less from food, and do not approach flesh, nor blood.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot application is on the wound, place an ointment made with rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is stiptic.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are careful about the hot application, then place on the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the boy I will tell you about in a moment: and if it has changed the air, then place on it some ointment until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the wound is large, or is from a cut with a sword, and similar: and the lips of it are not gathered by lips, then gather it with its own suture, according to what I will tell you about the sutures of the wounds of the lungs.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the bone has already been detected by the nail, and hangs down, and there is no hold on it except in a small suspender: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in its place, and advise the patient to eat food that is rough like the head, such as barley and boiled wheat, until it becomes soft: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If however I find putridity in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrid part, and remove it: then take care of that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however there is an artery in these wounds, or a vein through which blood flows: and it does not suppurate by medicines: then investigate above the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If however I find that it has not been cut, then dry it with salt, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the need arises when that which I said does not cure it: then cauterize it, until blood suppuration occurs.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small and simple: then the care of them is easy, light: so that this child covers over them, because it strengthens them before it changes the air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the Child's Birth.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe: Take one part of oil, and two parts of the blood of a dragon, and three unburnt bones of a calf: mix them all together thoroughly and boil them, and fill the wound with it, and bind it firmly with a good constriction, until it adheres well above it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it up over the child, and let it be, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fall off.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	The medical treatment will not be eradicated from him until he is cured.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	When the heating of the calx alone produces the effect, when there is no olibanum or dragon's blood in your presence, and when the same operation is performed on many large wounds, when it is brought near to be placed upon it and the strings are tied, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If the air has altered them in some way, especially in the time of summer, then the intention is not in the position of this child: therefore, take care of it as we have said, by putting something on it like this: either put something on it made from ground barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then, take care of the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, a fracture occurs with a small wound in the bone, and it is small, then extract it with the help of the Gestalt: and I will already tell you about the treatment of skull fractures in that which will be.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	¶ About Neck Wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	Head LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and the wound on the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, the nerve of the neck has already been cut or the artery, then if it is a nerve, there is no ingenuity in it unless it is to be treated with a stimulant like zinc, and similar drugs, so that its curative effect may be strengthened.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For nerves are harmful and they contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuity is with the brain, which is above the warm membranes: and that which is to be treated should be gently applied with medicines, as the calx lota with sweet water many times infused with oil, or with rose oil and tuthia, when it is dried out also with sweet water: and other dry minerals, in this way, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, on the other hand, the flap is large, then administer a suture: or a piece of cloth with threads for the corner of its lips.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then, take care of it yourself until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the wound is deep, or it happens in a sack in the lower part of its side, where already pus accumulates, then pierce it in a deeper place in that wound.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, the artery in the flap has already been cut, and blood follows from its flow: then separate or dry it, or tie it yourself: or cauterize it if necessary for that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the trachea has already been cut, or the whole thing is salued, and the neck is healed: then gather the sides of the skin with a suture over the trachea, and do not touch the trachea, in fact make it even, and reduce it over the natural figure.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then, tighten it properly, and release it after a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then, take care of it with ointments in which there is stippation and excision, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the flap has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bones in it, remove all of them, or as much as you can: and what is not prepared, release it until it puts out and separates and falls off with the exit of its egress.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If, however, the flap is recent, then cauterize over it the boy I mentioned earlier.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, there is an os in the flap and a fistula forms: then take care of it with the one who comes to his reminder in the chapter of that.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	¶ About the flap in the spatules.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	Consider the depth of its penetration when struck by a lance or an arrow, and then observe it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If the breath escapes from the wound when the weak one gasps for it, then you know that the thigh is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If the wound is not deep, and it is fresh with its own blood, then you will not place a piece of flesh from the first hour in it, nor tie it up so that the blood is not retained in the depth of its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the weak one. But place an attracted ointment in it, and let it be dissolved in two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If the ointment is not present with you, then place a stale piece of bread in the wound's opening, so that it may suck out what is coming out of it due to moisture. And make it sleep on the thigh, so that it may run where it is gathered in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If the wound has already lasted for three days, or more, and there is no spasm in the weak one, nor a bad heart trembling, nor a stricture in the throat during the cold, and you see other good positions of it, then you know that the thigh is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Treat it yourself and with linens, and the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If the cure of its wound is excused, and it has always opened, then you know that a fistula has been made.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Treat it according to the chapter of its kind.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the thigh is from a cut with a sword or an arrow, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with the wound that precedes from the suture, if it is large; or with the dirt, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If he has already made an impression on the bone and has inserted chisels from it: then examine the forearm, and if necessary extract those chisels, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then release them, until the forearm puts out, for they will be torn out.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, the judgment of other wounds in the remaining parts is the same as we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	¶ Of abdominal wounds, and the exit of the intestines, and their extraction.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the belly is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, when a great amount of bowel comes out, or the number of intestines,
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	why an introduction is made, and their suture is more difficult and painful.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small disruption can also be difficult from another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it is better to reduce them if you do not immediately go to the introduction of theirs: for it swells, opens, and grows: therefore, it is difficult to introduce its reduction.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a medium disruption is better for other reasons: for when it is not difficult to reduce the bowel, as it is difficult to make it slippery in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the wounds is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures meet in the suture of the wounds, and in the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures belong properly to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper when it is the suture of the belly: and I tell you one with the exposure and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I declare that when the elbow is small and something leaves from it out of the intestine, and it becomes difficult to put it back in its place, then this is due to one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or, as we said before, it may be due to the smallness of the disruption itself. Or, because there is inflammation in the intestine due to the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When this is so, then it is necessary to heat it, just as you would dip a sponge or damp cloth into warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or, you may boil the squint in water, and cyperus, and saffron, and mix it with the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	It sometimes makes the elbow in which there is stitching: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see the inflammation being resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the altha has been boiled, or the malua.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For this the entrance of it will become small when it is reduced to a small size.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, the return of it is not made after this treatment, then find in the disruption a smallness, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when prepared, than the section: and there is no compulsion to cut it after necessity and the failure of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let the part of it that is thick, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the end not subtle but rather subtle like sand, be indeed obtuse, even if it is somewhat so: and that which resembles cauda is what you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the elbow is enlarged and enters into the intestine, then it is necessary for it to be returned according to its natural form in its own place, if possible, on top of that: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When I say, "disruption" is wide in the lower part of the chest: then it is necessary that you make the weak one lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the chest: then place his head and his chest higher than his lower chest.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And if the disruption is in one of two parts of the chest: then place your intention and your consideration always in this, so that the part where the ribs are higher is lower than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And it should be that you apply it to the large wounds and also to the medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	However, in small wounds, apply it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands, a faithful servant who holds the disruption with his hand, and gather his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove from it him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common method of one suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you take the needle or the number of the needle according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go of the amount of the finger ring from the disruption: that is, the physician: and take one needle before what you insert into it in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the skin, which is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have gathered the two extremities of the skin and two extremities of the lips: and there will be four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with the thread double around the needle several times from two parts at once, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together by the aggregation of the threads, in an appropriate way.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the bulk of your finger and make another notch with it, then pull it back with the thread as you did with the first knife.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore, do not stop making it with the one you draw from the blade until you complete the constriction of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium size between bulk and fineness: for sharp needles quickly pierce flesh: and large ones are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it is necessary that they should be of medium fineness and bulk.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it should not be figured out in the two extremities of the skin very much: so that the flesh is not pierced quickly, and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and they should not be elongated even with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the sharp end, so that it does not hurt the weak one while sleeping: and put small pieces of cloth from all sides on those that hold the sharp end: and release them until you know that the wound has been completely healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this is indeed a better species of suture with a sharp knife for wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For one or two needles are enough for their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second suture is common, where you gather the four extremities: the two cuts, and the two ends, sew them together with a thread in the same vesicle, where the filum inuolutum is equal in fineness and bulk.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you pierce these four extremities with the knife, draw back the finger from the side where you entered it, so that the filum retatum from the upper part of the wound falls: so that the suture is as the suture of the band where they tie the bands, and put some quantity of the smaller size of the digit between all the sutures.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This suture is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when I made this suture on my own knee, which was wounded by a sword, and the wound was a complete separation of the flesh about two palms wide: it extended about two palms from the middle of the intestines, and was in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore redressed it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was therefore healed in the space of about fifteen days: I cared for it and it was made whole: and it returned after many years, coming back into its former condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians decided that it could not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in the place where there was no ointment to be found, and nothing from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore put on the wound an old bandage twice a day, and made the patient take frequent baths with honeyed water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will therefore mention two kinds of sutures according to the story told in the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you introduce the point of the needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	And when the point of the needle has pierced the skin, and gone through the flesh according to the length and breadth of the whole body: let the extremity of the sifac be on the side where you inserted the point of the needle, and make it go out at the other end from the inside part to the outside in the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	And when you make it go through, then make it go through according to this in the same end: and let the extremity of the sifac be on the side where you inserted the point of the needle, and make it go out at the other end from the inside part to the outside in the other end. And make it go through with the going through that you are making in the sifac end which is on the part, until it goes through the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then proceed and take out the same bone from this same side, and pull it out along with its end, which is at the other side of the flank, and extract the needle that has pierced the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it back to that skin, and pull out its end at the other side of the flank, with this end: and extract it from the outside part of it, and make one piece of it, and another: and make one piece of it after that, until you have pulled out all its external parts according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the overall stitching of this wound is that of the hair's wound, which is on the skin: so that you pull out its sifac one from one side of the skin: and let it go out from the other side of the skin, until you have completed it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second species of stitching, which he said Gale.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the report of his speech that he said, that you should stitch it according to the example, which some doctors use, in such a way that all parts are convenient for comparing them by nature: and he pulls out the end of the sifac at its other end, and the end of the needle at its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And it happens according to what I told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you make the needle at the end of the skin that is nearest to you from the outside part, and let it go into the inside in that same place: and let go of the two ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then roll the needle, and let it go into the inside from the outside part to the two ends of the sifac, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then roll them both, and let them go into the inside from the outside part to the two ends of the sifac that are on the opposite side of the flank, in the two ends that are nearest to you.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	This is the better method of suture, it is a common and easy suture, and it is the suture whose recall precedes this.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	Therefore, this is also Galen's speech.
Et dixerunt quidam.	Some said this.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the heart is corrected with two chairs.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	What is this, that you insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is near to you, and make it penetrate as far as to the side opposite, according to the suture of those who wear corselets equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the heart: then the suture of it is harder than the other parts of the heart.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the surgeon's wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	What is this, that when you press the recent wound with its blood before it changes to air, and reduce the intestine, and its own, and make them fit: then place it above the flesh of the unborn child.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If air has already changed the wound: then place some ointment on top of it, which is present to you, until they form pus: and the threads will fall, and they will comfort the skin, and they will marvel.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat that as the cure of the other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however, the medicines are not present to you: then place it immediately on top of it, and let it start to emit pus, and the old dressing: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicines in many positions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however, you fear that the wound will communicate to the principal members of the body in the injury: then it is necessary to dip the linen cloth in warm ointment, or in rose oil: and place it on the circumference of the places which are between the thighs, and under the scales.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then he should apply clysterization with wine tincture, black, warm: especially if putrefaction has already spread in the intestine, and a rupture has been made that reaches the connivation of it.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you know that what is from the large intestine is easier to cure: and that which is from the small intestine is harder to cure.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine that is called Jejune does not receive cure from wine, because it happens entirely within it: and this is due to the multitude of those which are from the umbilicus, and their size, and due to the subtilty of its body, and proximity to the natural nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the umbilicus is chyle, and it has been recently formed, and it has been received, then reduce it according to the reduction you use for reducing the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If it has passed beyond the space, and it has become yellow, or black: then it is necessary to string it with thread above the place where it was whitened from it, so that there is no flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in chyle there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond the ligament, and hang two of its extremities from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the attraction of its tail may be drawn towards you, and the extraction of its substance at the place of the chyle, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remember the wound that happens in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture happens in the intestine and it is small: then it is possible to restore it in some men, because I have seen that he was wounded in his belly with the lance, and it was from the right side of the stomach, and it was old: and a fistula was made, and it issued from it excrement, and vents.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I have applied the treatment, until I was not occupied with the cure of this wound: and I did not cease to examine it, until it was healed and the place was solid.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already solid, I feared the accident of a further illness on the part itself: and it does not happen to him from that further accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	He remained in the better dispositions of his life, eating and drinking, and going to the bath, and exercising himself in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some of the experimenters have said that when it happens in the small intestine and is flat: then it should be placed according to this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like the large ants' heads that you take.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wounds, and place one of them with the open mouth over the two lips of the wounds.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it is placed over them and their mouth is tied, the head of it will be abscised, for it sticks and does not come apart.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another of the ants' mouths near the first one, and do not stop doing this until the amount of the wound is all used up.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it again, and pull out the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is eaten, and it becomes healed, and does not cause a further injury deeply.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is possible that the intestine can also be placed with a thin thread: which has been removed from the animal intestine, and is annexed with it after it is introduced into the abscess.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is like that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it will be scraped off a lot.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the end of the thread loosely underneath.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the anus, and pull out the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it back into its original position.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with threads and the intestine, is not otherwise than according to trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, the belly which is large and spacious, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no ingenuity but in subtilization, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	¶ About the care of Zuchemia and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	¶ Head 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every belly, or ulcer when it grows old and becomes antiquated, and makes a sore, and does not condense, and emits pus always, and does not abscess: then we call it universally in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is according to truth, nodated with a filtered thread, hard, white: whereby there is no pain, which is the hook of the feather's shoulder: and therefore they call it by some Risati, that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it is divided by moisture in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And at times it is much moist, and is little: and it is large, and is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already promised in division, then when I said wound, that every sore which does not heal, nor is born in the flesh of it, is not this but for one cause only.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, or because of the scantiness of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because between it and above its lips there is hard flesh prohibiting the birth of flesh: or because it is many sore and hard: or because it is a multitude of corrupt things and corruption: or because the medicine is inconvenient in its cure: or because the decay is falling in the region, which is a kind of pestilence, or by the nature of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which difficult digestion of diseases is made, and the healing of the ulcer by nature is delayed: or because there is one bone, or number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	I have already shown you all these causes and signs of the wounds, as well as the curing methods using medicines in division: it is necessary for me to show you now how to cure fistulas and ulcers, which are made by a vascular operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, you know that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For example, there are fistulas that open into the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons: or into the intestine, or into the uterus, or into some part of the ribs: or into some part of the vertebrae of the back: and among these are those that open towards the proximity of the main member, and like members.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, from these fistulas, it is according to this mode that the disease is difficult to cure, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is heavy and lacks knowledge.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from a fistula of which the depth does not reach to those places that I have said, and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to become acquainted with it, then take a tentam from copper or iron, if the fistula turns according to the right angle, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then examine it with a tentam from fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, when it becomes soft by the ease of its body, and curbs around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula is having many openings, it is not possible for you to understand on it with a tentam.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, a clister is made from these openings from the openings of them.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture by which the clister is made, runs through the other openings, and runs from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, carefully investigate according to which mode it is possible for you: so that you know that here is the mouth, or nerve, and it is the confluence of the fistula long, or near: or it is a fistula with many openings, and stands above all this, with your greatest strength: when questioned by you about the weak, and by your finding of pain at the compression with your hand on the place, and similar to these signs and causes of accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then, when you stand above all that place with truth, then go to treatment with confidence: and it is as you see now, if it is a near fistula visible, or in the long distance from the anastomosis, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I told you: then cut the fistula according to what I previously mentioned from my narration, and remove what is in it from filtration and decayed tissues that are born in its opening from flesh, or thole, and similar: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is long and deep, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary for you to cut it as far as it is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all the decayed flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply the ligature to the sharp medicines: and thrust it into the fistula confluence that you have comprehended with iron: do while that, until the sharp medicine completely removes all that remains in the fistula confluence from decay.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal by this, then cauterize it according to what we have mentioned.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If then the cause of the fistula is the mouth, and it is certified to you that this is so: then investigate it and clean it according to what I tell you: if nothing prevents you from anything from the mind, or nerve, or the principal member, as I said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If then it is discovered from you that the mouth has a corruption, and it is black: then wash it until the entire corruption of it is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is in it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If then it does not heal, and it emits pus as before: then you know that you have not succeeded in the complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore wash it again on that spot, and make a careful effort to shape its reasoning, and cleanse it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that this corruption is deep in the far reaches of the body, which you have not followed.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore it is not with you in this case, unless you let nature go.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If then the small mouth is corrupted, and it is possible for you to draw it with fine needles that are suitable for this.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then make a careful effort to attract all of them, and do not let anything go with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If then it creates something contrary to you from the moistnesses, and there is no fear of the cut in them, or error: then cut those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If then there is no preparation for you to remove the bones from your time, then place on the buttock that putsrefies it: and let it go until it putsrefies what is in the circumference of those bones from the flesh and moistures.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	Guard the wound so it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And secure the cut you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Place a thick layer of the following over it, if you fear: a ground sulfur with oil, or a submerged cream in Egyptian ointment, or any other white ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	When those moistures putrefy, and the bones separate from them, remove their detachment, and draw them out.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If, however, it is a single large bone, such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, and if that which is corrupted in it is a large part: then scrape it reasonably last, until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, that which is corrupted in it is a large part, and the blackness has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to tie it up, and insert it all the way to the place where the blackness has permeated the bone: then care for it until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a rule that happens to a boy in his thigh: place this example and aid over your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	A boy of about thirty years of age had pain in his thigh, caused by something that moved within his body, that is, from within outward, until the matter reached the knee, and there was a large apostemata: and it was not an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, at that time the wound extended with him, until the error of the physicians was discovered, and many matters came together with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And then the treatment of his wound was applied, until the fistula in his thigh was made, and many openings were made in him: all of which expelled pus and moistures of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	The multitude of doctors was about two years in practice, and there was no wise man in the art of handcraft until I was called, and saw his craftsmanship, and the materials that were running out from these openings: even the whole body of the patient had been washed, and its color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, let us insert the probe into one of the openings, and apply pressure to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to be swelling from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I proceeded and followed one of them until I detached a part of the bone: and I found it to be corrupted, which was already corroded, denuded, and putrid, and perforated, until it reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Then I saw what I had found, and prepared a knife from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I ordered that there was no other corruption in the bone except that which had been cut off, and I sawed it.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a wound restoration with the solidified medicines over a long space of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again and detached from the bone above the first detection: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what I had seen earlier from that same corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I detached from it again, and did not stop hitting the particular bone, and trying to restore it: and it was not restored until I hit about a palm of bone, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the medicines, and it became quickly solidified and healed, and this iteration in the operation and section of it was not necessary, except for the weakness of the patient, the lack of tolerance in it, and my fear of it because of death, for it happened to it in every hour from the excess of the evacuation of the syncopal bad hump.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	The patient has been fully cured, and a new bone has grown in the appropriate location, the body's structure has been well-arranged, strength has returned to it, and the patient has returned to his usual positions without causing any harm to his walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	However, if a prominent bone is already fractured: then it should be treated as follows: and it is: take the ligament, and tie it tightly at the end of the prominent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and place another, thicker ligament below the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie the ligament over the flesh that is on the bone: and extend the end of it, so that you draw the flesh down to the lower parts: and then place the flesh over the place where you wish to suture, so that it does not harm the sutured flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a plank or a board under the bone below: for when you do this, it is not forbidden that it may seize the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it should be a suture over the place where the corrupted flesh is, so that it does not be in contact with the bone corruption: and it should not appear in its appearance to the senses, and it should compel to the suture of his wound another.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then it should continue to be a part of itself with another part: and the corruption is in the middle of it or in its own part: then place the flesh away from all parts of it completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place a plank below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then suture it from the first part where the corruption is, until it continues to the other part: and the suture should be according to the length of the corruption, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint and suture the bone where it continues from the other part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If I say corruption is in the continuance of two joints, then there is no genius except in the scarring.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If corruption is in the hand or foot paw: then that is difficult to do with a will.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed, you should inquire about the corruption as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scar it, and dress it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with however much ability you can muster: when it does not cause your veins or nerves to conflict with each other.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you know that the cutting edges of the knife and the saw for this bone are many, according to the placement of the bone, and the preparation of them, and their own size, and their fineness, and their magnitude, and their evenness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is fitting that you prepare all kinds of instruments suitable for this operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you know that these operations signify to you the superiority of the instrument with which you rely, when you have a long-sustained desire for it.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the modes of this art, is a testimony to the suffering of its diseases: for then you will find by yourself that which is suitable for it from the instruments to all infirmities.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am assuring you of the end of this chapter, the number of instruments that you place examples on which you cut, and the trial by which you experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw is depicted, it should be properly drawn.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let the arc of this saw be higher, and its sharpness from iron: and its handle from wood, and it should be properly made in a pyramidal form.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of the razor's blades.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this razor should be shaped like a star: and its points should be like those of an elischema.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suit unless it is sharpened with the blades of this razor, when they are worn down, or if the mouth is large and wide.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of the medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of the wide razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of the razor that has concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of the other subtle razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of the other curved-tipped razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of the large, subtle-tipped razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of the razor with which the bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The shape of the other large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a radio, and its end is like a sword: it is shown in many places from the bone.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of the razor that suits to the rasping of this one that has been pierced through the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is a triangle, and its tip is sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And it should be that all what I mentioned are made from razor, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	About the cutting of the ends, and the cutting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	The head 189.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you have been treated by a physician for this corruption, and the cure is not accepted: and you see the corruption spreading to the member, which does not remit anything: then it is necessary to cut that member as far as the corruption goes, so that the weak one may be eased through that from death, or from the greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	The sign that is affected by this is the one that diminishes the member until it is thought to have been burned by fire or putrefied after being blackened: until the putrid matter spreads throughout the entire body, until the membrane surrounding the member is reached.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when the incision is made, and similarly if the cause of putrefaction is from the striking of certain venomous animals such as scorpions, sharks, rats, and the like: then, the membrane surrounding the member should be cut away.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If putrefaction or striking is at the end of the finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave any room for putrefaction to spread until it reaches the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger, and do not leave any room for putrefaction to spread until it reaches the shoulder.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it spreads to it, then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	However, if you see putrefaction passing through it, and it is near the elbow joint, then it is the death of the weak.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to take care of this beyond that, is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly when putrefaction spreads to the toe, then cut it at one of the nodes: and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	However, if it ascends to the knee, then cut the thigh at the joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if putrefaction has already spread above the knee, then there is no courage left except for release and leaving the weak to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting or binding the member is to tighten the ligament in the lower part, which you want to cut, and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	He extends one of the serving ligaments to the lower part, and extends another ligament above to the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	He then separates the meat that is between the two ligaments with the Spatumil, until the whole meat is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is applied or squeezed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to cover all sides of the linen bandage, and do not touch the healthy place with the knife: and the wound of the injured part should be heated.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If however, the flow of blood inside while operating, then cauterize the place slightly: or put some small wound-healing pus above it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then tie the wounded limb with the suitable ligament and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that this happens to the man in his foot, this is the same thing that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because the blackness happens in his foot, with the ash that is similar to the combustion of fire: and the corruption happens first in his thumb, until it begins to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man himself cured himself, after he saw the corruption happening to his member with the violence of its pain, which he found with its ash and combustion: and he applied it at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, it happened to him the same corruption in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with the same thing that I put on his hand with medicines after the purification of his body: and the excess was not repercussed, and it began to go into another finger: until it began to corrupt in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to extend my hand for the incision: and I did not want to do it, hoping that he would benefit from the repercussion of this excess: and I was also afraid of the death of this incision on his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the virtue of the man was above the accident.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he despairing of me, returned to his earth: and came to me because he had hurried, and extended all his hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this story unless it is an aid for the above that falls from the species of this disease: and so it has a meaning by which it is said, and according to which it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Regarding the care of Sinuum, and the quality of clisterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 102.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in some fleshy parts, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until the collection of pus is made: then it either ruptures or is perforated, and goes out what is in it, and leaves a watery place as if it were water: and the skin which is over it is like fine linen which has been woven: and it does not reach the end of its corruption in its corruption, nor impresses on the mouth, nor in the nerves, nor in the ligaments: therefore it is right to call it Sinus: and it is not called Fistula: but if the space of its abscess is prolonged until it impresses the corruption on something of these parts, then it is called Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care of it is to incise this skin completely as it revolves: and especially when it has been made fine, and has been made like linen: and I trust that it does not adhere to its place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If you indeed hope that the skin adheres and does not follow the corrupting final connection: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then care for it with Clister: and it is, as you consider, towards the Sea.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large and the pus that comes from it has a fetid odor: then apply Clister with the Egyptian medicine, which is a mixture of vinegar, oil, and zinc, and parts are received equally, and are aggregated into a vase: and they are boiled over fire until the medicine reddens: and it will come to a thick consistency like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and apply Clister with it to the Sea: and close the orifice of it, and release the medicine into it in an amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with the expression: do this for several days until the Sea is cleansed and the fetid odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is Clistered with ash and water, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is, as you consider, that you take ash from burning wood or ash from burnt oak: and discard over it the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then suck it, and apply Clister with it, until you are confident that the Sea has been washed clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient is not able to tolerate the medicine of Egypt, nor the ash and water, then apply Clister with water and honey, which has already been mixed with something from crushed zinc.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or apply Clister with honey and wine, because of the property of honey, which cleans and washes: and the wine makes the Sea adhere, especially when there are superfluities of styptic and drying in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you perform that several times, and I am confident that the sin of corruption is already removed: then clysterize it with that which you do when you cause flesh to be born in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, as if you take from plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose-colored oil, and wine-acetic: or clysterize it with some medicines, and ointments of others, whose properties I have written in the book on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the sin of the orifice is a strict one, in which the cannula of the clyster does not enter: then enlarge it with iron almost: or place in it the limb in unguentum Egyptian, or in unguentum basilicon, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if it is also an enlarged orifice: then gather the lips of it with the suture: and let out from it that quantity which it enters into the clyster without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice through which the pus runs is eleved to the upper parts: then dry it in a lower place that is in it, so that the pus may run down from it: for when the pus is compressed in depth, it prevents the flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to dry the sin lower down according to what you wish: then dare, as if you were preparing the member by preparation, so that the pus runs out from it with facility according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Dare, as if you were not retaining anything at all from the pus entirely: and take the solidified medicines which are put over the sign, compatible with what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the linen bandage.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the bandage be of such a size that there is communication to the whole sin.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then make an incision with small notches in the direct orifice of the sinus, almost at the orifice of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend another application of gentle ointment over the cloth according to the size of the foramen: and place it over the position far from the orifice of the sinus, so that the pus would come out from there: and you will not remove a large cloth unless after a few days one.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	He who is above the orifice of the sinus is he whom you remove at all times, so that what aggregates in it from pus may go out: and to know whether that which runs out is much, or little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you again consider the place of the sinus of his own, does the lord of it feel the pain there, or not feel any pain in it, and is there not an apostema in it, or is there not an apostema in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When you extend your medication in this way, and see what comes out over the orifice of the sinus, then you know that the sinus is adhered, or approximates to the adhesion: then you can loose it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loosen it, then change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if it comes out from the sinus after a long distance, then do not despair of its adherence, because the healing of his is approaching, for there are men who slow down the generation of their flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act against him.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if it comes out from the sinus after many days of indigested pus, then you know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If then the adherence of the sinus is slow and prolonged, and then add to the drying of the medicines, let the doctors make them, so that they are in the substance of their humid and in their virtue their dryness, just as unguent dyafinicon, when it adds superfluitas additionis ex zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	After the last significant part is treated, it is that you should take a ointment of dafine, and it dissolves with rose oil, and is poured over it an old wine equal in substance to itself.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then close it with this, and use it alone.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does the same action when there is not a dafine ointment present for you, honey, when you extract it, until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and frankincense, and olibanum: grind them all together, and put that on the honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then lay a linen cloth over it, and bind it with a cord around the belly: and when the melted honey is thickened, put a layer of it on the outside of the cloth, and then place the cloth over it and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when a long aristolochia is given in that, and the heavenly lily roots, and the lily itself: and herb flour, and centaury, are mixed together,
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Either grind them simple, or mixed together, grind them, and put that on the honey which I will give you, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the wound does not heal and prolongs the belly, and you know that there is corruption in the depth of it, or that it has made an impression on the bones, or on other hard parts, or on the ligaments: then treat it according to the treatment of fistulas, as I have mentioned before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	¶ About the cure of Panaritis and the roughening of the nail, and the addition of a cut to the digit, and the section.
Caput XCI.	Head 11.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritis is a blister that is born under the pollex of the hand, or of the foot, and may be born in other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When this is prolonged and neglected in the care of the patient, and is treated with hot aspersions: or it corrupts, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole, and perhaps it spreads the corruption to the mouth, until it has an offensive odor: and the tip of the digit becomes swollen, and its color becomes black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you care for it thus, when we say in division, and does not share your care: then it is necessary to burn the remaining superfluity with iron all over the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For a cauterant is hard on the nail.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the mouth is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the additions to the nail begin to compress the flesh towards the interior, and begin to hurt it, then it is necessary to place a thin layer of radium under the angle of the nail which presses the flesh, and push it upwards: and burn away the remaining flesh with medicines that are burning, until the whole of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already settled in the mouth, then it is necessary to burn the mouth and remove it: for the mouth is never healed while the corrupted part remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption increasing in the digit, then burn it in one boil, according to the rememoration of what was previously said.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If however the nail has an abrasion or a blow: and it happens that there is pain in the vein, then it is necessary to insert a veinlet at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then scrape off the nail with a sharp knife slice, transferred from above to the eye.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard against it being cut through to the flesh beneath the nail, for you are causing this by the section that is on the weakest pain, and it will be a cause of adding new flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then attend to the place with that which soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	But the thumb that is born in some human hands may be entirely fleshy, and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it, and some are born from the root of the joints, or it is a growth of its nodes on some of its digits.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which is born from some of the nodes of the digits does not move, and that which is born at the joint of the digit may perhaps move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, that which is fleshy among them is easy to section.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That which you do is to cut it at the root of its own self with a sharp knife.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the treatment of its growth that is in the root of the joints is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in that which is born at the last node of the digit, then it is necessary to cut into its flesh with a round section up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then sharpen the bone with one of those saws that are convenient for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then attend to it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the consolidation which happens to the digits is often due to the growth of man, that is, it is born with him, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the combustion of fire, and suchlike.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is therefore necessary to allow that consolidation to take place, until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place a thread between them, or soaked wool in rose oil: so that they do not become too quickly united, and separate the threads: or place a thin sheet of plumbago between them, until the location consolidates according to what is appropriate.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if the consolidation occurs between some fingers and the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to what is prepared and becomes the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ Of the Incision.
Caput XCII.	Head 122.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	The veins are often enlarged, heavy, and full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many parts of the body: and the most frequent of these is found in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and labor, and carry.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary to give a rubbing of the body from black bile, with a strong rubbing.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then make a bleeding on the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	They are unclosed, so that they may heal, and black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another method is to make the vein swell, and draw out all of the blood.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First embroider the thigh with hot water, until the thick, feces-like blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tighten the weak thigh from its upper part of the hip, until the lower part of the knee.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the vein in one place, or two, or three, by wide section.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then, that is, remove the blood from your hand with the bloodletting instrument from the lower part of the thigh to the top, and first, it should be done on the weakest one.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then, remove the nail from the foot until the amount of blood you see is sufficient and can be endured by the weakest.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie it: and tell him to fast from foods that produce black bile: and again, let there be an evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and do not harm the weakest.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The ablution of this part is done in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the weak leg if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce it into the bath: or rub it on the thigh of the weak one with hot water until it reddens and the veins become engorged, or exercise strength training if there is no bath nearby, until the member becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then shave the skin in a direct section along the length of the vein, or in the last part of it at the knee, or in the lower part of it at the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with tweezers and scrape the vein from all sides until it is visible to the touch, and it is at the appearance you see it turn red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it comes out of the skin, it seems like a string or cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce under it the radium, until it is abluted and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a black cat's claw, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then shave another section near that one about three digits wide.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it is visible.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then remove it from it with the radium as you did, and suspend it with another black cat's claw, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another cut, or more cuts, if you need them for that.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then separate the tissue, and cut the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until it comes out from the section that is above it, or from all higher sections, until it goes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you to extract and separate: then insert a knife with strong wire doubled, and tie it, and pull it out of that: or insert the radium under it, and rotate your hand over all parts until it goes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to separate it gently, and it goes in above the weakest part of it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you pull it out completely: then place over the wound a piece of linen dipped in wine and rose oil, or rose oil: and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having twists which make it to be applied to parts, and not as we said according to the straightness: then it is necessary to place above it over all the twists of it, and locate the involutions of its own.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with a garter until you separate it completely: and be careful not to cut the vein or wounds above your section, for it will be difficult for you to separate or pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore keep your wisdom.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The form of the cut that heals the vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The form of the blind man's eye.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not like the others of the blind, neither is it sharp at the extremities, so as not to wound the vein: and it has a coarse bend, but a gentle one: for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein with its own subtlety: moreover, it is superfluous coarseness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Extraction of the Thigh Vein
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 37.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the thighs on earth, such as in hot springs, and in the hot lands of Arabia, and in dry and hot lands, in few tender regions, that is, in which there is neither grass nor tree.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Indeed, its generation is from putridity which occurs under the skin, just as occurs in the bodies of snakes and ascaris worms, and the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And a sign of the onset of this vein is that which occurs in the thigh with inflammation of the skin.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then it becomes infected.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from the place of its infection, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore you see the end of it, then it is necessary to suspend a lead weight on that branch, whose weight is from a drachm to two drachms and one grain, and release the hanging lead from the thigh.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	When therefore something exits from it towards the outside, suspend that in lead, and that branch.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If however it is extended for a long time, then a part of it will break off, and suspend the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it off before it has completely exited.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it off, it contracts and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess to be formed, and putridity in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to treat it with great care, and to draw it out gradually, until it has completely exited from its ultimate end, and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this very vein some people are able to draw out, which is in length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	It has already become evident to me because he escaped from the man of XX palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	However, if it happens to you at the time of your medicine: then insert the root into its opening, and make a long hole through the body, until all that is in it of matter has come out: and administer putrefaction to the site with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of the healing of the aposteme.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	Indeed, this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and they issue from all openings a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, take care of it as we have said in the division, and with what has been said before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ Regarding the sectioning of the vermes generated under the skin, and it is called bouina ailment.
Caput XCIIII.	Head 143.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This ailment is called in our land the Aegritudo bouina: because it happens very often to bouids, and it is a small worm, which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes through the whole body, going up and down: and it is shown to the sense during his walking with his member to his member, until it breaks at whatever place it breaks into the skin, and it issues.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from some putrefaction of humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	So do worms and snakes, that is, pinworms, and ascarids in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And he fears from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when he himself goes through the body, and rises to the head, and becomes evident to him, and it issues, and it destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When you therefore wish to treat him and draw it out, then this is not done unless at his walking and his own sensation.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary therefore, to draw that which is above him, and that which is beneath him with a strong constriction bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry that which is over it, and pull it out.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is driven into the flesh, and you do not find it: then place the cauterium above the place with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And that which is greater than what you fear, is a corruption of it, which corrupts the eye, just as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it already exuded near the eye in the head: then draw that which is under it beneath the good tightening eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry that which is over it, and pull it out.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that he use a weak cleansing of his body, when the physicians are curing the putrid humors with bad medicines.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction for himself.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	¶ About the section over the sickness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head 45.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This sickness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that happens in some members, and then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have seen it, according to what I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I am called to a weak woman in some wools.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he detaches his arm, and I see a small inflammation in the weak thread of his arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour has passed, I see one inflammation coming up with the fire, just as a child comes up, going to his shoulder higher than it can be: just as silver runs when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain then receded from that place and became fixed in the hip.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for an hour, and it ran into the rest of the body until it became inflamed in the arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was rotating throughout his entire body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed at the speed of its rotation from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	Indeed, I had not seen this kind of eye ailment before in this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who found the pain to rotate from one member to another: and I did not see it as a woman sees it.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not think this to be so, unless it is because of the fact that she was one of those women who detect venom from dry bodies: therefore, it appears to the senses that the vapor has rotated.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary, therefore, that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and in dry bodies, and in humid bodies.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you are treating this, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is visible to your eye as I said, then tighten above it, and run quickly beneath it: and dry it above it until it departs from the confined vapor: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with the movement of the body, and with that which expels the vapors, and compresses them with the smelling pills, and the pills of serapin, and such like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	¶ About the extraction of the Sagittarius.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 56.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	The Sagittarius is divided according to the species of its form and the location where it falls from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	The diversity of their teeth is great: for among them there are those that have large and pointed ones, and small ones: and sharp ones, and smooth ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them there are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them there are those that have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them there are those that have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to the limbs in which they lie, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or if the limbs are from the principal members, like the brain, and the heart, and the spleen, and the lungs, and the intestines, and the uterus, and suchlike.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore the dart falls into any of these limbs, and you see signs of death which I will tell you later, then it is necessary to extract the arrow from that limb, for death follows it in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see those signs of evil, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the limb, then take out the very dart, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the dart falls into the brain, and pierces the mouth, and goes out through the siphon which is over the brain, it is: for there happen from thence sodorrhea, and scotomy, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and diarrhea.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may issue from the nostrils, or from the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And water comes out from the place of the wound, like white fluid.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it issues from there like the water of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then these signs appear to you, then desist from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	When the arrow falls into the heart, these signs are: that which is near the left breast: and it feels as if it is fixed in hard matter, not in soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's motion is similar to that of the pulse: and it runs from the black blood vessel.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it follows the cold at the extremities, and the cold sweat, and the syncope.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know then that death has likely occurred far from doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And when the arrow pierces the lung, the sign is the spongy blood from the vein: and the wound that follows the neck, bleeds, and changes to a weak color.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the spirit exhales a great, high breath: and it seeks the cold air's attraction.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	That if the arrow falls into the chest, which is in the breast: then it is near the ribs: and there is a great thirst with a painful shout, with a sigh: and all the muscles of the upper arms move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach: then perhaps it will emerge from the vein of something undigested in the food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is felt there: something from the vein emerges, either feces, or dung, or a broken intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope in its treatment, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	That if the arrow falls into the bladder, and it emerges with urine: and something comes out from it to the outside, and the pain is greater on the weakest part: then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	Furthermore, the remaining parts such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, auxiliary tool, dorsal vertebrae, wishbone, leg, and thigh are healed according to various dispositions: when it does not find an arrow at the artery, or a nerve: and there is no sharp arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen the essence of these arrows, as you understand through this treatment for your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because an arrow fell into the tearful eye of a certain man, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was cured, and it did not cause harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jewish man, which fell into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not succeed in extracting it except by the tip of its small branch, with which it adheres to the wood of it: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jewish man was cured, and it did not cause harm to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is this one that has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I held it over the same under two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore, I was careful with it until I extracted it: and the Christian was cured.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man who fell into his stomach: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I followed the instructions given to me by Albucasis and extracted the arrow. He recovered and no harmful event occurred to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man who had fallen on the arrow in his back, and the bone was healed above it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years, the arrow was expelled from the root of his hipbone.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman who had fallen on the arrow in her belly, and the bone was healed above it, and the arrow remained inside her, and nothing had changed in her condition, and she did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man who had fallen on the arrow in his face, and the bone was healed above it, and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not find much pain: and similar cases many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from a man of the king's principals, who had fallen on it in the middle of his nose, and it had already inclined to the side of the left part: and the arrow was hidden entirely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I am called therefore to care for him after the fall of the arrow until three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the bone of the arrow strictly healed.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore I questioned it with gentle tension, and did not find it: and he himself found the prick and pain under his gold on the left side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore I hoped that it was the prick from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore I applied the place with plaster, in which the virtue attracted and digested, confident among me that it would be the place where the arrowhead would appear, and a sign of the arrow would be visible to me so that I could cut on it: and no accidental event occurred in the place, meaning that the arrow had reached the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	He should then be constantly bandaged for many days: and the wound does not become worse, and the flesh has healed over in the meantime: but he remains weak from the extraction for some days, until he feels a shaft one day in his own nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I then applied sharp medicinal ointment over it for many days, until it is open: and when I touch it, and feel the tip of the subtle shaft that clings to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp ointment, until the tip of the shaft is clearly visible: and it passed by me within about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then after the wound was enlarged, and it might be possible for me to insert thumbs into it, and move it, and not obey the exit: then I did not stop sharpening and engineering over it with such methods of ingeniousness, until I succeeded on a day with thumbs made according to their form, according to which they wish the end of the fingers to be, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed doctors judge that the nose cartilage does not restore.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore he restored it, and the wound was healed and solidified, and he became healthy in full strength without anything harming him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you about the quality of the extraction of that shaft: so that you may set this rule and meaning over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts and distinctions of this art are not comprehended by narration: nor does that book comprehend it, and a wise artificer compares with little to much: and when he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of things foreign to this art, when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I declare that arrows do not depart from the parts where they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or on the opposite side of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And those that depart from where it entered are either an arrow going into flesh, and is attracted and goes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That is, if it does not submit to the exit from the hole from which it fell: then it should release it some days, until the decayed flesh around it allows the attraction and exit of the arrow.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly, if it is fixed in bone, and does not submit to the exit from you: then release it also some days: and then bring it back with the attraction and movement every day, until it goes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That is, if it does not submit to the exit after a day: then it should be drilled around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a sharp tool, until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already entered into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those things that I have mentioned seem to be unwell: then stop the attraction of the arrow, and release it, until it is equal after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow pours into the sinus, then death will not be prolonged to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed but only in the bones, and has not yet reached the sinus: and remains weak for a few days, and nothing unfortunate happens to it from those things: then the ingenuity in the attraction of the arrow and its removal.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed tightly and does not submit to the attraction: then apply a sharp tool around the arrow as I have told you: then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow has already become concealed within the body and is hidden and concealed from sensation, then seek it out when you attempt.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If, however, you perceive it, then draw it out with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot draw it out due to the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow in the deep part: and there is no mouth, nor nerve, nor vein: then seek it above, until the wound is amplified and it is possible to draw out the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If, however, the ears to which it is tied have any, then free the flesh fixed in them from all sides, by every means you can think of and by other means as well, if it cannot be drawn out by extension of the flesh in the fracture of the ear, and by its twisting, until it is drawn out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand with needles to all parts, until you draw it out: and with the finest subtlety of the end, so that the arrow does not break, and it be difficult for you to attract it and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If, however, you cannot draw it out from the same hour, then let it be for some days until the putrefied that are around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try it again: for then the flow of blood will turn against you, so administer what I said for the care in the chapter of it: and protect your virtue from the wound of the vein, or the nerve, or the cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use all the means you can think of for the drawing out of the arrow: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	It is necessary that you act when you draw the arrow, that it be weak according to the figure, according to which was at the case of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more severe.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow that is going out from the opposite part of another thing, or already goes out something to the outside: or it makes a bulge at the end of the arrow through the sense of the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it prominent: then cut over it, and it should be a section according to the quantity that they take in the screws.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it: for it itself makes it easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow prints in the bone, and enlarges itself: then draw it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: release it for a few days: then try it again until it goes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the wood of the arrow is in it, then drive it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood of the arrow has fallen, and you want to give a push: then insert the pointed instrument into it so that its concavity reaches the end of the arrow: then drive it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave, then drive it with the instrument that is being inserted into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow goes out through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cut the whole flesh in which the venom is, if it is possible for you to do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it as it comes to that.

And they are of various kinds, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and the flexibility of the wound, and the constriction of the wound.

Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the hook-like end like a radius, so that its entrance into the arrowhead can be easily fitted with the impeller, and it is pulled out with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.

However, of the two veins that are under the tongue phlebotomy: is that the phlebotomy of the Cephalic is to the prefructions which are in the throat, and the weakness of the uvula, and the weaknesses of the face.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Of the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, there are three veins in the elbow that have been used for phlebotomy in all humans.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pressing with a myrtle knife on the wide side of the vein: or dipping it into olive oil for its fineness: or drying it with a phlebotomy knife, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, which is convenient for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them there are flat species, and fine according to the size of the veins and their stricture, the form of the myrtle knife's phlebotomy is flat, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is convenient for opening swollen veins, full, flowing, apparent, heavy, and those that contain thick blood, turbid.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomy is of less width and finer cutting.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is convenient for the phlebotomy of fine veins that contain thin yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the basilic vein phlebotomy.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the basilic vein's phlebotomy is one of the three veins' phlebotomies.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from diseases that are under the throat and neck, because of which it follows the chest and the heart, and the vein: and it is convenient for the phlebotomist when he phlebotomizes it, so as not to cause fear, because there is an artery under it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If then he errs, and adds to the point of bloodletting, he will incise that artery, and there will be a current of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary that the surgeon not cut it with a sharp lancet, but let it be dry like Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If then it does not appear in a clear appearance of the Basilica, then it is necessary that you yourself change it, or ask for another one, or look for a branch of it: or for the place of bloodletting, use the tendon of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is clear itself, and cut it with Alnesil's lancet, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If then you wish to bloodlet from the same one, then it is necessary before the tightened arm, to touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then make signs over the place with a waxen candle, then the arm, and cut the incision with Alnesil's lancet, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that it does not fall by the impact outside the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the bandage, the inflammation in the place where you marked with the waxen candle, then that is the inflammation of the artery: therefore it deserts it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	And if you see blood to rise at the place of bloodletting, as urine from a child, and it is a thin red blood, then you know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore stop, and put your thumb over it in a long space, then take away your thumb.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If then the blood is discharged (for it often comes out), then tighten the arm, and let it go: and be careful of the weak one by its motion, and let it be above the fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	It does not matter if it takes several days, until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	However, if blood does not clot and does not bleed, and there is no immediate medical help, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends are contracting, and blood clots.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of leather from a fist, and find it. Take one-half of it, and tie it above the place of the vaginal stricture that is fitting, with a bandage and stitches up to another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood clots, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of it with the one whose reminder precedes the flow of blood from the child's wound: and the clotting of that blood is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small size of the wound, and the possibility of the bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	¶ About the bleeding of the vagina.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	However, the bleeding of the Fusace veins is not a wound, because it draws blood from the superior part of the head and the lower body: for it is composed of the Basilic and Cephalic branches, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it comes under the bleeding of that vein, so that it is above fear from its bleeding, for there is a nerve under it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore, if it is added to the puncture of the bleeding, and it finds a nerve, there is a loss of consciousness, and it is difficult to heal its wound, and perhaps it will not be cured completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle and not shown: then it is necessary to place your bleeding on the vein that you have phlebotomized, with the section of Alnesil, and the nerve that has been cut with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If a vein lies between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	De the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	However, the cephalic vein has a bloodletting effect because it draws blood from the head and carries it to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is suitable in this vein, if you wish, to bloodlet it by pressing with an olive-wood or myrtle phlebotome, because it is the easiest of all veins, because there is no subcutaneous artery, and no nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	Nevertheless, it is convenient for you during the bloodletting, to cut the head with the knife, and seek a gentler place: and it will not hurt it if it is not found with the first pressure, but returns over it with the bloodletting several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Nevertheless, perhaps it may be stuck in some people when not bloodletting in the first pressure, but it will not hurt them in anything.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Regarding the utility of bloodletting and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	However, the quality of bloodletting, and the accidents that come from it, in which you should think about its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First of all, that of which it is necessary for you to know, that bloodletting is not given unless in the preservation of health, and persistence in it, and caution against the approach of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And let bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the arm, namely the cephalic, and black, and basilican veins.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And let bloodletting be done at the beginning of spring on fasting, in winter, and in summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	The bloodletting should be performed on the first or third day, after the three hours have passed since the previous day's bloodletting.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, bloodletting in diseases does not have a fixed hour: it is performed whenever convenience and necessity arise, at night or day, and in every hour and time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not appropriate to have bloodletting performed on children until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman undergo bloodletting, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men be bloodletted, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore anyone wishes to be bloodletted for whatever reason, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before bloodletting with clysters, if there is much fecal matter in them: so that the urines do not attract venereal disease from the putrid superfluities of the intestines on the principal membranes during bloodletting.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should bloodletting be performed on a patient who is sated with food and thirsty, nor on one who is drunken, nor on one who is intoxicated, until that has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should bloodletting be performed on a weak person with hydrops.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let it not be that bloodletting is done again after a passion of colic, and vomiting, and flux of urine, and multiplication of coitus, and labor, and exercise, and fasting, and all things which have dissolved the strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if blood is gross with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible to do that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if nothing prohibits it: or exercise himself in some exercise, to make the blood subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	After performing the phlebotomy on his chest, let him lie still for three days, as we have said. And let us hope that his chest pains will subside on that day from all the evil animal incidents: such as constriction, anger, and fear. And from all the body incidents: such as labor, punishment, excess, and the like.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make these things present when he is seated, as is the custom of humans from the use of aromatic substances, and odor, and tincture, and the like, in proportion to their possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the surgeon should sit on a higher stool than that used for phlebotomy, and then he should take his arm and rub it with his own hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie the ligament with the corrector and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the tie be temperate, for when it is unequal or too tight, or due to excess in tying, it prevents the flow of blood: and in loosening, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then it is necessary to rub the person being phlebotomized with his own hands until the wounds become swollen and visible to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the surgeon should clean the phlebotomy with a little oil, properly his own.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his left hand thumb on the wound under the place where he wants to do the phlebotomy, a little: so that he does not fear the wound, and it is not struck.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For the wound is like a fleeing string from phlebotomy: and there is one that is full of blood: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and deceives the surgeon, and does not open the wound: and if it opens it, it is tight: therefore it is necessary for the surgeon to be firm, and to be anxious about all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then, bloodletting should be removed.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then, one opens the vein with wine, it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then one should try another little amount of wine, or above it with haste: if it does not bleed well.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it is too fast, or the patient is weak, then let him be released on the day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps it will attract hot blood.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	He should not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat bloodletting, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If it is small, or runs blood slowly: and be careful not to let out too much blood quantity than you wish: then repeat bloodletting in the same hole according to its straightness, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste, before the place bleeds, for the bleeding place is in many men at small operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If you see it already bled, then do not repeat on it entirely, for it does not excuse in front of you anything.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something from the fat oil above it: because it accelerates the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than the rest of the olive.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer oil to all your bloodlettings where you open veins against the course of blood: and they make it Tyrrian alfarach, and sagozene when it is placed from one of them above the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood flows and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it happens in the bloodletting vein, which often happens, especially to those who are not bled except with wine, or the vein is small, then immediately and place above the place a sponge infused in water and salt, slightly warmed: and string it for an hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	It is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from one of the veins itself, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something remains in the place after a few days of black or yellow discoloration, it will not harm it. And if you wish, put something over it such as aloe, or myrrh: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamite or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Indeed, blisters and inflammations often occur at the basilica vein phlebotomy.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Then place your hand over it, then if you find a soft spot under your compression over it, that inflammation is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, so that you can put something over it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from that artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with the one that has stipitation, so that the place may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that all men withdraw from blood in proportion to the strength of their own vigor.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color of the wine over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red: and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes smooth: and similarly if it is sharp, then let it be taken out of its sharpness.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and desires a single wine for extraction of blood, so that the phlebotomy of the vein may be amplified, and the phlebotomus be on the side: and in him who is weak, it should be opposite to that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary for him to draw it in the wines, and that the foramen be strict: and it is better that what is given in the vein phlebotomy is a section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	This method of bloodletting is safe and prevents the flow of blood, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting through the length and breadth.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And how it is used before bloodletting at syncopation, it is necessary that food be taken moderately before bloodletting, either by infusing it in water of the grape harvest, or if it is heated, then it should be taken out of the blood in three or four drops.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is cold, then she should take before bloodletting a piece of bread infused in warm water, or in aromatized honey with spices, or in aromatized odoriferous syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	And if a syncope occurs at bloodletting and it is the cause of its exit of blood many, then she should take in a drop of animal juice and a subtle odoriferous syrup: and use aromatics with algues, and rub her chest with them: and use the rest that I mentioned in division in the chapter of syncope from ejaculation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But if he wishes to achieve the veins of his arm and to dissolve his blood secondly, it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is due to excessive ejaculation and his strength is weak, to gradually dissolve blood by the quantity of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But if he wishes to achieve the veins of his arm and to dissolve his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then he should do this after seven hours, or take a new bloodletting from his first one.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But if he wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which he inclines: it is necessary for him to achieve it on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body the blood is much heated, becomes sharper, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary to let out the blood in a single stream from it into the void, and take out a large quantity from it: and enlarge the wound as far as the syncope occurs: after which you shall have all conditions of phlebotomy under your control: and when you place your hand on the pulse of its course of blood, so that no death may occur in place of the syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Indeed, this often happens when the phlebotomist is unaware, and carelessness falls upon him.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not proper when you are about to cut off the arm, and cut into the blood vessel a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of the blood is difficult, so that it comes too soon upon it with suddenness, and is extended carelessly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For this is a bad omen, in fact, let it be postponed until the second time the phlebotomist does it.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove that which is coagulated with the blood from the opening of the vein, and place something dissolved in salt over it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something over it from Tyrian tar, or pitch, and place a gentle compression on it until the blood lets out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has already been stunned, then let it be postponed until it has settled.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That is, if the necessity provokes the cutting into the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either the phlebotomist himself should be cut above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the arm of the phlebotomist is cut at the place of the Fusa and the Basilic veins, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	The quality of the phlebotomy procedure is such that the practitioner inserts their weak hand into hot water until it turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then a ligature is tightened around the same vein with a medium amount of constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy is performed gradually, not laterally or according to length: and there should be a wide opening, and your phlebotomy should be over the hand joint.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the exit of the blood is forbidden, then you should repeat the hand in hot water, and let the blood run in the water until you fulfill your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if you are in the summer days, then you can excuse the repetition of the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And the course of the blood is particularly noted in hot water during winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	The phlebotomy of this vein is safer for all veins, because there is no pulse under it, and no nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	However, the phlebotomy of the left hand of Salutatus is beneficial for the ailments of the elbows.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	The quality of the phlebotomy procedure is such that you tie a large bandage around the hand with your hand, or with your own hand, after you have inserted it into hot water until the vein is visibly inflated and demonstrated to the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the phlebotomy is performed by transfusing the blood.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm that part in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep it, so as not to lose your hand with the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For there are nerves of the fingers barely stripped from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand in hot water, and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	If you do not make it pass through warm water, blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and it is forbidden to proceed.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you withdraw the required quantity of blood, then put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot hastily.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do the same when all branches are tight.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The left hand is the instrument of phlebotomy, for it refers to the abdomen's pains: and do the same in this phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	However, the instrument of saphenectomy is for the abdomen's pains which are in the lower part of the body, such as the pain of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and weakness of the liver, and old ulcers of the cheeks and knees, and similar pains.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that it inserts its weak foot into warm water: and it makes a rubbing on it until the veins ooze: and tie it above the joint of the foot with the splint.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the vein indeed is at the heel, appearing as if it had turned the thumb: and many branches of them are cut off on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, this phlebotomy is done in a wider branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregation: for it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	However, if you do it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And then place your phlebotomy as if you wanted to touch it, and make it like the phlebotomy of Nesile.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the exit of the blood is forbidden, then repeat the foot with warm water: and let the blood run into it until it flows out.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the surgeon errs in the first vein, he will then proceed with the venipuncture to the upper parts rather than the lower, for it is safe and he does not fear any harm from it, when you cause damage to the nerve, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly when the saphenous vein of the other foot is equal.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	However, the location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is behind the heel on the sole side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the pain of the venipuncture of this vein is, when it is caused by hot blood, below the ankle.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of the venipuncture of this vein is that it enters the weak bath and festinates: and he should string the crus of it from the sole of the ankle up to the calcaneum four fingers, with a thin and long string: for it does not appear unless for that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it appears, then the venipuncture of this vein according to your intelligence is possible, or according to transusion: and it is better, or if you cause damage to it by incision, or you leave it by section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer and it is hidden in many men.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the sense: then the venipuncture of that branch is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and the one that is opposite to the auricle: and cause damage to the nerve and make the blood run according to the quantity you want.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then dissolve the stringed one, and place the corium on the place of the venipuncture, and string the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ About Ventilation and the Quality of Its Use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 58.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventiles are made from the corners, and from the air, and from water.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	The expansion and contraction indeed occur in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When there is scarification and blood extraction, and the other is ventilation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation, which is without scarification, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is like when it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations given with scarification and blood extraction are fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and is the last on the head: and Alkehel, and is in the middle of the neck: and uentosae Alhagdahim, and are two layers of the collar from two parts simultaneously: and uentosae menti, and is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and uentosae duarum spatularum: and uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: and uentosae duorum focilium, and are in the middle of the two biceps: and uentosae duorum crurium: and uentosae duarum cauillarum.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And indeed ventilation does not draw blood from you out of the thinly scattered veins in the flesh, and for that reason it does not cause weakness from them, just as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary to give ventilation if it is with fire, or without fire, in some diseases that are caused by excess, until the whole body is ejaculated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If the necessity arises for ventilation from disease, or because of habit, we give it at every hour in the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and whenever it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is, because of men who when they multiply blood in it, until they need an extraction by ventilation, find in their head a grauedine and soothe.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them is one who finds fullness and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them is one who finds itching on his face and forehead, as well as darkness and lethargy in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is one who feels pain at the place of ventilation of his own.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose laughter is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is one who finds a taste of blood in his mouth: either he swallows it or spits out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is one who sees in his sleep blood, redness, dead, and similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see something from them, and especially if it is in the middle of the third week: we advise ventilation to be made after they have passed two hours or three.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	However, the ventilation band is: because it itself conforms to the age of the head, and what is poured out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that this should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this indeed is ventilation in the place of the cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use it by one who has a cold complexion, or in which there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it does not bring great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore it is not necessary for them to use it in the elderly, and in which there are cold diseases in the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But if he is too diligent on it, a forgetfulness is generated for him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore it is necessary to advise the ventilator that he should take his hand off when it is almost ventilated to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventilation or Albucasis is in the place of the phlebotomy of Fuscus and the Basilican phlebotomy, and for this reason it confers strength, and constriction of thirst, and fissures caused by instrumental thirst, and tussle, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be forced to ventilate Albucasis somewhat, for if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	However, ventilation or Albucasis confers pain from accidental injuries in the head, and obtalmia, and hemiglossus, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in the place of the Basilican phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it should be preceded by ventilation or Albucasis, so that the person does not cut their hand with the sharpness of the phlebotomy: so as not to rupture an artery, and to cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	However, if ventilation or Albucasis is used under the chin, it confers alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gum, and similar afflictions that are in the mouth: and it is in the place of the phlebotomy that is in two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	However, if ventilation or Albucasis is used for the spatula, it confers to the alcohol that is made from the reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	However, if ventilation or Albucasis is used for the internal parts of the two fingers, it confers the venation of the three veins of the thumb, Basilican, and Fuscan, and Cephalic: for it attracts blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh: and they attract the small veins from other large ones until the attraction becomes three.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it should be preceded by ventilation or Albucasis, so that it does not proceed too much in the sharpness: for the place is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	The windmill that is saturated with vapors over the alkalis, causes hemorrhoids in the anus, and lower wounds.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to first dry the windmill so that it is greatly saturated with vapor and comes from the air. For the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the fine winds will be broken, and a large scarification will be made.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	However, the winds reduce pain in a manifest way: for they draw blood from the whole body, and bring back old pains to the roots of the legs, and to the mammary glands, and uterus: they provoke menstruation, and bring back bothor and adenitis: and they stand at the place of the two saphenous veins and the alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Nevertheless, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the juice of the alhorcobeni is near to the juice of the two winds of the legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The position of the winds is such that you place the vapor on the first vacuum, and the sugared suction: and do not prolong the position of the winds, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors come to the place in equal measure: and do not cease to repeat this until you see the place already red and inflamed, and the redness of the blood appears: then scarify, and repeat the suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who are soft-skinned and rare bones of humans, it is necessary to scarify themselves once, not more, so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And order the winds to enlarge the scarification and make it deep, and moderate the suction in ease, temperature, and motion of its own.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a thickening in the blood, then it should be scraped twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In water, indeed, the first opening of the veins for subtlety and transparency of blood is made, and in the second, the purification of the coarse extraction of blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is foul-smelling, then a third scraping with water should be made: so that the final result may be obtained.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And at the end, when we want to draw the blood gradually, or rather, slightly, one scraping is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want to draw the blood in large amounts, we make many scrapings by scraping.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it should be scraped deeply by scraping: and the end should be equal to the depth of the skin in the scraping.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which should be administered from oils at the position of the wind, and what should be avoided?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case where the skin is thick, hard, black, and the holes of its skin are narrow, it is necessary that the places of the wind be oiled with open, soft, and thin oils: if it is in the season of summer, such as the oil of alkeiri, or the olive oil, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of the cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the season of winter, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of chamomile, or sassafras: and such like oils.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is superfluity that is thick and cold, then the oil should be marigold oil, or the oil of balsam, or white oil, or almond oil: and such like oils.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If it is indeed necessary to cleanse the large intestines of young animal flesh, then it must be prohibited to use oil, and it must be necessary for them to wash the parts of the Ventosarum with water, either hot or cold, or with water from a cucumber or a gourd, or with water from a pitcher, and so on. And similarly with them.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	If the one whose blood is much watered must wash his intestines with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach water, and so on. And similarly with them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	If the superfluities of the one are large, he must wash his intestines with old wine, or with water, or with camomile decoction, or similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it must be taken care that the purification is not made in the bath, or in the bathroom, but it is necessary that something is given after leaving the bath, either for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that someone sleeps after purification.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What should be done to regulate the purification or the phlebotomy before the purification?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And then, after that, it is necessary to consider in the first place: if the purification or the phlebotomy is choleric, and its blood has sharpness and inflammation: then it is necessary that he receives cold, as grapefruit juice: and also endiuiam with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin with vinegar and lemons, and iuleb with vinegar and rosemary, and similar to them.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And then, place the meat of its chicks, and the lean meat of the he-goat, and cooked foods with bran, and similar to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if the complexion of the one is cold, it is necessary that he takes in a pot syrup made from honey, or from almond, or from alsecaniabin made from seeds: and he takes wine aromatic in moderation, which is between old and new: and he should precede, that he use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	I place the food of this bird on its back, and I will feed it: and sparrows, that is, young pigeons: and chicks of columbine (turtle-doves) shall be demanded.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	It is necessary that the drink of the day's ventilation and bloodletting be more than the food: it is necessary that it be given in a cup in some men in Tyrian hours or in a musk box, that is, a muscate, or in an alewife before ventilation: and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal limbs may be strengthened, and the blood may be thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary to drink it in a hot cup.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ About ventilation without bloodletting.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, ventilations without bloodletting are those that are placed on the back, spleen, and podagra, and over the ventrum, navel, and place of the ribs, and the pixis: for these parts do not bear ventilation above themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought for unless there is an attachment from a blood vessel to another member, as we place a ventilation over the breasts in illness of the nasal bloodflow.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to dissolve the cold ventilation introduced into the member: as we place a ventilation over the ventrum and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself refreshes the member, and heats it, and relieves the pain because it dissolves that cold ventilation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys when there is poverty or a stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	Indeed, the force of its attachment may open the poverty, or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it does the same when it is placed over the back and spleen to make them ready for ventilation at both places.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	These ventilators are administered with vaccua only when sliced.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered with hot water in pleurisy: and this is, that the ventilator is filled with it, and it should be large, with only hot water, or with water in which herbs have been decocted that agree.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the ventilator administered with fire:
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	The form of the ventilator administered with fire: Let the width of its two open digits be according to our model: and let the quantity of it in the deep part be half of a palm: and let there be a small opening on the side, in the place which is approximately in the middle, for the needle to pass through, according to the amount that goes into it: let it be made of all of its edges of thin silver, equal, and rounded: so as not to hurt the member at its position above it: and let there be a small hole through the middle of it, of silver or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this ventilator has already become large, larger than what we have mentioned, and smaller than the other, according to the severity and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For ventilators are different from those of children, and extinguishers are for males and grown-up bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	However, the quality of putting this ventilator with fire on the member is, that it is like lighting a linen with fire from linen, or a small candle from wax: and place it over the middle part of the vagina that is in the lower part of the ventilator: so that the fire is lighted in the lower part of the ventilator, so as not to burn the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed over the member: and the finger is over the opening that I said, until when we hold the ventilator: while we need, we remove the finger, and the vapor comes out above that opening, and the ventilator is dissolved immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then ignite the mustache according to its own mode, and then you will have it if you need that.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	In Ventosa, which is applied in the disease of pleurisy with water, there is no hole passed, nor a channel: and it is not given unless it fills the water and is placed only on the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the more this Ventosa is, so that it can catch much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ About the suspension of Sanguisugarum.
Caput XCIX.	Head 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguisugae are not given in many, except in which there is no possibility of the position of vents, because of their smallness, such as the lip, and the gum, and those like them.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a bare member, such as the finger, and the nose, and those like them.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that the vents from Sanguisugarum which are in sweet waters, are free from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are released into the sweet water both day and night until hunger is satisfied, and nothing remains in their vent.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body will be discharged first with bloodletting, and with ventosis.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the weak member until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterward they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, and fall, and there is a possibility of suction with the vents when using sweet water, then it is the last in the treatment: and if not, then wipe the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then when much water is used, and it frizzes, and is expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	That if the course of blood is prolonged after the Sanguisugarum, and that is the residue: then pour linen flax into cold water, and place it thereupon until the abscess is cut off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If blood is multiplied, then apply a poultice of crushed herbs, such as mint or similar ones from wound-healing plants, until the blood is absorbed.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they may be laid on the spot with halves of flaxen bast rags, and left until the flax adheres to the place, as blood is absorbed.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary to change them if necessary, when it is possible, the blood-letting herbs.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, blood-letting herbs are prohibited from being hung up, then the place is to be washed with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or tie a string in the place until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are laid on, for they adhere immediately when they feel something come from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When you want them to fall, apply a poultice of crushed aloe or salt or ashes on top of them, and they will fall immediately.

Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of broken bones and displacement accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that fools of doctors and physicians, and those who have never seen the ancient book, or read from it, stupid about this chapter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, it is neglected because this method is isolated from the sciences on earth.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never found any good in it at all, and I did not get that from it, but I got that only because of the long reading of ancient books and the study of their understanding, until I extracted science from them from those.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I attached the experiment and study of the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have now described to you the entire science contained in that chapter: and above what my experiment, after having abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it at the end of the abbreviation, and showed the end of the declination: and I formed many forms in it, from the forms of instruments given in it, when it is from the addition of the declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summae and collections from the bones which are necessary for their fracture, before we begin to remember the diversity of the members, and of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the preface of this chapter, summas sermonis, and chapters, to whose understanding the first thought of the artificer is directed primarily: that is, so that you and those who are quick may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say that when it happens to anyone of a fracture, dislocation, torsion, or case: then it is necessary that we proceed, as soon as possible to bleed him and to make him whole, or both at once: if nothing forbids, such as weakness of the vigor: or is he who happens to be a child, or an old man: or is the time of violent heat, or violent cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, cold vegetables, and cold flesh, and bloody meats, and hazelnuts: and forbid wine, and fat meats, and all food that fills the belly with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	When you are secure and have withdrawn from the hot post, and there is no rush of material to the part: then return weak to the regimen of its own first with which it ran its custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the bone is beginning to mend the fractured tooth, then it is necessary that the weak one be fed with foods nutritious and abundant, coarse, heavy, in which there is roughness: just as food made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and feet, and bellies, and intestines of flesh, and eyes, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and such like.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	When this regimen causes coagulation of the fracture to be made better and faster.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you know that bones which are broken in the young and in those who are in the first stage of old age, and those who are feeble, cannot continue to grow and be consoled according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs: and they become solid and continue which are made from them at the end of their softening, just as the bones of young children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to glue on the broken bone from all sides, where there is coarseness, which adheres and strengthens it until they are glued together, and bind them together until the end of strength and firmness, just as was at first, until it does not prevent anything from the operations of its own: and for this reason it is necessary that you give food to the weak ones with foods coarse and rough, in which there is coarseness, and roughness, and roughness, just as I have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you know that the appearance of fractures is diverse according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the skull: and the fracture of the bone of the chest is different from the fracture of the bone of the back: and all other parts of the body are diverse in their coarseness: and I come with a remembrance of all the kinds of fractures presented in the chapter distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	The types of bone fractures are also diversified within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it is made to be a curved fracture, except for what happens to the stars in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it is made to be a fracture according to the length of the bone: and then are the fractures of its stars, that is, its points, and additions proceeding, as are in a thorn, when the quill is bent to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and it is a fracture with the ulna and disruption at the head: and it is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every type has skill, or a proper instrument for its restoration, according to which it may remember it, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from which it knows the curvature of the bone, is the curvature of its own, and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	And when there is not in the place a visible curvature, nor sound when you touch it with your hand when you press the bone with your fingers, nor does a weak man feel a great pain: then there is no fracture, in fact it may be that there is a curvature, or a small fissure: therefore it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compression entirely, nor to put something on it from medicines that come to the place after the moment that fits the place: then the tightening of the subtle string is.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you know that the place when it is curved, and is divided into two, except for what happens to its points, yet every part is removed from its comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to correct it, equaling it before it gets a hot post.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot post happens to it, then let it rest for a few days until the post is quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then it can be made equal according to whatever manner is possible with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you know that the restoration of it and its equality is easier than bones where the satrapies happen.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then draw it tightly, according to what you remember of its remembrance.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are satrapies in bones, then it is necessary to extend this fractured member of two parts, if the hand is, or foot: or if your hand, if the small member: or if with two cords, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position when you place the member on a equal place, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured member are extended: then dare hope that you will make those additions with all skill, and according to whatever manner you can in their places: and take care according to your strength, so as not to cause pain on the weak one through your operation, nor injury, and dare according to your strength, that you apply one of two bones to its companion bone according to the better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time to test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see something different here, correct it, and make it equal by the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And take care of the extension heavily, and the compression strongly, as many foolish ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often make the hot aphthorax happen through their operation, or the contraction in the member, as we have already seen that from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after the equality, and the proper operation, and the tightening of that member, and the quiet and tranquility: and warn the weak on it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it draw, so that it does not move in the hour of its vigilance, and in the dreams of its revolution, and its agitation, and at its excretion, and all its movements with the last virtue of its own.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	That the position of the limb does not cause pain when it is followed by another position.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Because when the limb feels pain or damage in a certain position, it is necessary to change it to another position that does not cause pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And so that the position of that limb is equal and straight, so as not to cause bending in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fixation of the broken limb is according to what I say.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken bones are differentiated according to their strength and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Those that are small, such as the arm, hand, and finger, then it is necessary to make a soft and thin wound.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those that are large, such as the thigh and leg, then it is necessary to make a wide and hard wound.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide ligament connects the large limb and keeps it equal from all sides, so that the wound does not reach the mark.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin to put on after your evacuation a liniment suitable for this, in a soft lump over the place of the fracture of that limb.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to dress the ligament over the place of the fracture of that limb with three or four stitches, according to what is suitable for the limb: and hold your hand tightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the upper part of the place of the fracture, and tie less than was your wound, which you tied at the place of the fracture.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then elongate yourself with the stitch at the place of the fracture, and soften the wound a little, until you catch from the healthy part a great piece.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another whole leaf and apply it over the same place where the fracture was, using bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterward, with the bandage, go to the lower part of the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your operation should be in the stricture of the bandage, and in its mollification, according to what we said in the first bandaging above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the bandages a piece of plaster or cloth equal to the tortuosity of the fracture, if there is any tortuosity in the fracture; and if not, do not place anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then apply another bandage over the same leaf.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then place stars equal to the bandages on the opposite side immediately, if there is no swelling or hot application in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If there is swelling or hot application in the place, then place on top of it the thing that is sitting on the hot application, and remove the swelling; and let it be for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten the bandages on the same leaves.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stars should be made from the middle of the cane, sharp and well-formed; or they should be made from wood where the rasps are made, which are made from pine, or from the braches of the palm tree, or from caling: and the width of all the stars should be according to this form and figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it should be the star that is placed over the same cut that is grosser and wider than the others; and the length of the star should be according to what can be allowed for a member, according to its size and thickness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten the bandages on the stars with the other leaf, according to the first tightening.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie up underneath with threads equal to the bandages, according to what we said about the tightening; and it should be that your tightening is over the place of the fracture, and the more it elongates from the fracture, the less the tightening should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	It is necessary that there be medium-sized threads in number and fineness, and they should be soft from linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads be thick, as I have seen from the operations of the stupid ones, their threads from twisted linen strings will be wrong: for the tension falls outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And fine threads do not agree again: for you do not obtain that which you wish through the tension with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	It is not necessary that there should be between a star and a smaller star than a finger.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	For if the weak one is hurt by the extremities of the stars after the tension in healthy places: then place under them from the gums soft, or carded wool, until nothing is hurt from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When however a fracture is with the bone, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I remember this according to the particularity of that chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you know that not every limb fractured should be tied with stars from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb when it is big, it does not ought to be placed with stars above it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of apostematism with hot bands.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way of plasters which the ancients used to restore, which are placed above the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Common mode of emplastri restoring the fracture, agreeing with many complexions, especially with women and children: for it is from that which does not heat nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the dreg of the miller, and it is the millet which hangs in the walls of the mills at the movement of the mill: and you place it thus as it is, except that you do not put it with the veins: and you place the confection of it not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The method of plastering is another for treating fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	The recipe for the plaster is: myrrh, acacia, gum arabic, and mucilage; and honey of the whole, in the amount of ʒ X, aloes of the whole, in the amount of ʒ V, and alethil, in the amount of ʒ XX; all are to be ground together and mixed with water of aloe, or with albuca if the complexion is weak and cold.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and it can be used by many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plastering that also heals fractures and sprains.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	The recipe for the plaster is: gum arabic, honey, and white aloes; myrrh, in the amount of ʒ X, aloe, in the amount of ʒ VI, arsenic, in the amount of ʒ XX; all are to be ground together with much contrition, and they will be mixed with water or albuca; and they are to be administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The method of plastering for joining pieces together and separate bones from their places: and it soothes the pain caused by accidents, and it stops the splitting of bones and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	The wax is heated and submerged in vinegar, and then decocted with oil; and it is placed on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no virtue of healing, but it is good for the sedation of hot affections: and it expels the pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of plastering that heals the broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Gather the leaves of the fig tree and the leaves of the papier plant; grind them all together and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Mode of applying plaster, administered during bone fracture restoration: and when you wish to achieve the remaining cure with stitching.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for old-fashioned roots, and chamomile, and flowers of herbs, and all parts of a certain flour, one part each: they will be all burned, and then mixed with wine, if there is no heated limb.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the limb is heated, then mix it with moistened coriander water, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of applying plaster for better resolution than this first one, when hard stitching occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for old-fashioned roots, and linseed seeds, and balm, and mallows, and sage, and flowers of herbs, and chamomile, all parts, one part each: they will be all burned, and then mixed with salt water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The entire thing according to the heat of the limb, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the fractured limb during its restoration, unless black is made from lead and oil: no other: and he reported that it should be a medium between bulk and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen suggests that they should be placed on the fractured limb during its restoration, in which there is a heat excretion, such as myrrh, and aloes, and olibanum, and similar ones from them that we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of applying plaster for wounding and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for mugwort, and chickpeas, and human hair of the teeth, or the feathers of birds, and old roots, and salt parts equal: they will be all burned, and then shorn, and mixed, and a plaster will be made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity, according to what should be, that remains the ligature, then it is dissolved, as you see now, if there is no pain for the patient, nor itching, nor movement of the fractured bone from its place: then you do not resolve it days many.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If however it happens to him in the place pruritus, or painful, or inflammation: then immediately, and dissolve in an hour, and remove from it the plaster: and take a soft bandage, or a wet sponge, soft: and immerse it in warm water, and wash away with it from that place, until the pruritus is quiet, and the pain sits down.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on it a cloth which is burned, submerged in vinegar and oil, or pink oil: and bind on it overnight until you are secure from the hot apostemate, and the pain in the member is quiet, and the inflammation of the limb moves away.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then go to the tight strap and a thin plaster: and do not tie it with your first constraint, and the thin ones with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the apostemate, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all the accidents are almost removed, and you need plaster and constraint, then go on as you have done at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If something of what I said does not happen to the member, then do not dissolve it unless after three days, four, five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when that which has been released for twenty days, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as I said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of the flesh is over it: and also then in the constraint add more than the first constraint entirely: and also in the ingestion of weak food, according to what precedes the rememoration of this.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see a place where the wound has already dried out and been scraped, and has been rubbed more than it should have been: then you know that nourishment is forbidden to be applied to it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, the wound itself should be emolliated with warm water at all times where it can be soaked, and this should be done for three days, and then the wound should be tightly wrapped.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	From this operation, it follows that nourishment is given to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, that which the stupid restorers do to the wound of the member, when it does not heal at first, according to what is proper, and heals according to the bend of the limb, is an error in their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, as the ancients said in their books, and were operated upon at that time.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I do not see any of their tracks in that entirely, and it is better that it be not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	About the accident that occurred in the head.
Caput III.	Head 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of the fracture are diverse, and the figures of it are many: and the causes of it are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For the fracture is that which is made by striking with an ensign: and the blow removes the whole bone until it becomes wetted to the siphon, which is under the bone, just as axe does in wood, therefore this species of fracture is called the axial one.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Sometimes the ensign strikes some bones, and strikes their face, and does not pierce the cut to the end of it: and this species of fracture is called the Kalaaan, that is, the Absolute Leuation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a lump of two fractures, either great or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	The cause of this fracture is a blow with a stone, or striking upon a stone, or similar instances.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This fracture is also a transverse one, which is approaching the tendon beneath the bone: or it is on the face of the bones: and it is a fracture of both of these two fractures, whether it be a small one or a large one.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from this fracture is a hidden one in the bone, in the subtlety of the hair: and it is a small fissure, and for that reason it is called this kind of fracture of the Capillaries.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these it is a fracture which is made by chance, or by a blow with a stone, and similar ones which make the layer of bone to be driven into the interior, and to be in the same place as concoction: just as happens when hot iron strikes them, and their parts are driven into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this is done most of all in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children's bones.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these kinds of fractures are separated, and I remember this with regard to the whole in its own place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these kinds of fractures by the detection upon it, and by the inquiry into them with trials, and by the removal of the corrupted flesh which is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The kind of the Capillaries is known by this, that it is detected above the bone, and is removed, and is bound around it with wax: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the curing of the fracture, consider first the accidents of the weak: then if you see from the accidents that signify with clear meaning over your fear, such as diarrhea, and extension, and loss of understanding, and glottis, and syncope, and acute fever, and exit of eyes, and redness of them, and similar things from the accidents in many dispositions, I think not that it is cured: and if you see not those things that terrify you, and hope for your health, then begin the care of its.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If it is, if it comes to you wounded first when it wounds: and this is in the winter days, then it is necessary for you to study in the removal of bones before the fourth day of the month according to all arrangements.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary for you to remove the bone before the sixth day, before the thing that is under the bone from the bandage rots, and those events that we have mentioned will happen.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already become involved with the bandage touching the brain, and it is with minutiis, and with attraction: then it is necessary for you to incise the part that is comminuted and attrit, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, as the head of the wounded: and pull it up on the bone whatever possible is for you: and according to the figure of the wound, and what is above the weakest.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you at the detection of the bone flow of blood or hot apostema: then put it against with that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, as you fill the place with the bandages infused in wine and rose oil: and you make the knee to be quiet while the apostema is settled, and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin in the care of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And it happens according to one of two modes.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	A mode indeed is, as you cut the bone with the Incisorio strictae aciei: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	From here, you administer the Incisorium another post Incisorum latius eo parumper: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then you also administer another Incisorium latius even than the previous one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second method is to have the numbers of the various types of incisors at your disposal: some of which are broader than others, and some are narrower than others. They should be located at the very end of their own kind of sharpness, and should be made of iron or steel. And use them with ease in percussion on the incisor, so as not to hurt the head, but to hurt the tooth itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	However, if the bone is strong and hard, then it should be tapped around its circumference before you administer the incisors, as the Terebrae (which are called Terebra, not for their depth) do not penetrate to the end of the bone that is beyond it, because the Terebra is the rounded extremity above it, which is the sharp sub-cap of its head, similar to a margin and a smaller circle that prevents submersion and passage through the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it will suit you to take a large number of Terebrae from these, as each one suits the quantity of bone density, until all of the Terebra is present in your skull: whose sharp end's quantity in length and breadth is, according to the quantity of bone density of your skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	This is the form of the three kinds of Terebrae (or Trephines):
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of making the hole in the fractured bone is: place the Terebra on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then turn the Terebra to another place and place it where the radius of the hole is greatest in quantity or about this.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors that is between all the holes of the bone: and do this more gently than you can above the end of the sharpness, as we said, until you have dug into the bone, or with your hand or with any other instrument which you have prepared for this, such as hammers and thin punches.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	It is necessary that you take all precautions, so as not to touch the drill or the spoon anything.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you circumscribe the bone while drilling, and the separated part is continuous with the spoon, if it remains in the bone with another similar incisor tool, it is necessary that you make the wedges, and leave an equal end to that which remains in the bone with the instrument.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thinner and more subtle with other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If something remains in the bones, and the chisels: then take it with ease, with that which is with you from the tools.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the elbow after that with liniments, and the ointments that I mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another mode of operation is easy, absolutely far from fear: which Galen said and highly praised it, and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	First of all, it is necessary for you to start removing a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more apparent and manifest: until when you remove that part and place the end of this lenticular Incisor's form under it, whose this is the shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part does not touch anything: and the sharp part of it is on two sides of it, running along its length, as you see: so that the lenticular part is attached to the spoon, with its sharp side facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike it above the Incisor with a small hammer from one side, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it turns: and you will be secure from the bandage, which does not happen in that happening, which you fear absolutely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not a foolish man, and more ignorant of it, nor was sleeping, then if something remained attached to the bone from the bandage in some places, it would cut it away from the sharp side of the Incisor's lenticular form with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	This book is released by him without harm and free from fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	If the fracture does not penetrate up to the bandage, and what is cut off from the bone is the appearance of the bone, and the roughness and subtlety of the sharp edges remain in the same: then it is necessary to remove that roughness and the subtle edges with sharp scalpels, as you have prepared a variety of numbers of them, so that you can apply any of these more suitable ones to all places, and more correct to their own, according to what leads the operation towards that, and the broken bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary to apply according to your measure, which in the first place, cuts the bone with wide rasors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a still finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this according to continuity, until you become able to apply more gently and more finely of all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	However, in all the remaining small fissures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to apply care according to what leads to the correction of that.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And there is a thing which is not hidden over everything, which in this art is desired by everyone, and stands over what we have written and shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	However, if the bandage is detected and retains the wrap, when you cut the bone: then it is necessary to take a piece of linen according to the size of the wound, immerse it in rose oil, and place it on the wound openings.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of linen doubled or tripled, immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first bandage, and do this as easily as you can over that, so as not to cause inflammation.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer the ligament above it: and do not tighten it unless by the quantity that holds the bone only: and release it with this care once a day, or for two days, until you are secure from the hot axe.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer the medicine afterwards with those that are superfluous dryness, such as the roots of the lily, and flour of herbs, and powdered thorn, and aristolochia, and such like: and it is as if you were making a child who would become dry on the bone as these drynes are.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer to it all the medicine which is such as to abstain, and does not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care according to your virtue, that the bone be clean in your cure: neither let there be in it soot, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Neither release the bone to aggregate in it altogether, for when the bone is aggregated on the brain pan, it corrupts it, and corrupts it itself, and happens to the weak after that great malice: and it has already happened in the siphac of the head, when the mouth of the head is being made clean from it, especially when it is neglected in its care, a blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider now, if such accidents happen to the weak as I have said, know that it is far from doubtful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, unless from the medicine which is put on it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make it black: then it will be necessary for you to take of honey a part of one, of red oil three parts, and linen with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the siphac: after which care it with the colors of the curing, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	The section is about the restoration of the nostril when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	The title of the chapter is Caput IIII, which means Chapter IV in English.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that noses are not broken except for the two upper parts of it at the same time, or only one of them: therefore, because they are two bones: since below it is cartilage, it is not broken, and it does not happen to it except for abrasion, and twisting, and similarity.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If only one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary to insert a small finger into the nostril of the nose, and indicate the fracture with your own thumb, and with the deformed hand, until the nose returns to its natural shape on the figure: and this should be done with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And take care that it does not happen to it through your operation on the weak pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and it does not reach with the finger: then it is necessary to make equal to the end of the radius, in which there is a small lump.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that: and as soon as the restoration of it is on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at quiet, with hot stitches, at the place of the fracture.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a lint into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two lints if the fracture is in two parts: and let the grossness of the lint be such as to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers said that they should be wetted with honey and turned over every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	This does not seem to me, but rather it is necessary that the lint be wetted in gum, and complete with the flour of the mill.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then release the lint, until the bone is firm and the cartilage becomes hard.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when it is introduced into the nose at the place of a goose quill, after being softened over the same cloth: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and does not hinder weakness from inhalation.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do this: and if you wish, make the lint.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If the nose is again burned while you are operating, apply a cold plaster to the nose with rose oil, or with rose oil infused with a little vinegar, or with a little ointment made from dyer's turmeric.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If the nose does not burn hot, then it is necessary to apply the plaster with flour of wheat and powdered turmeric with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are broken or ground, then it is necessary to cut above them and take them out with the instruments that are appropriate for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then care for the cut with what is appropriate for it to heal and become solid with the suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If it happens between the nose and the cheek, then it is necessary to treat it with lint: and give a catheter of lead until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	¶ About the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken:
Caput V.	5. Head
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not with the cheek, then observe if the fracture is only deformed and not broken into two, and it is curved towards the inside: then the knowledge of it is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If then the fracture is in the right part, you must insert your thumb on the left into the weak tooth: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert your right hand into the tooth: and press with it the exhaustion of the fracture, drawn out with ease from the inner part of the bone, towards the outside with your other hand, and make it equal to the same.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If then the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two parts, it is necessary to give extension from two parts according to straightness, until equality is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If then convulsion or disruption has already happened in the teeth, then tighten those from which you hope that the remaining ones will remain with gold wire, silver wire, or thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a weight on the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a bandage on the broken jaw, and place a large magnifying glass or a fragment of the sole's sole equal in length to the jaw on top of it.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it up from below according to what is prepared for you as a tie, and make sure the application is suitable until it is not destroyed, and tell the patient to be calm and quiet, and place soft food in his mouth.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If then you think that something else is changing in any figure of any mode, then immediately and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has changed from that, and make a plaster of the pulverized wheat or flour with alum, after you have removed the weight, and place soft wool on top of the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While this plaster is still attached to it and does not change the position of the bones, let it go, so as not to dissolve it until it is healed, or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is held together by many strings for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If an acute burn occurs in the meantime, then administer that which we called multotiens in its sedation until the burn is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a tendon, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Then separate from the bone the thin part of it, or from the nail: at this time use you those things which you can to remove that part of the nail with that which is convenient for you in the removal of them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If indeed the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it with the phlebotomy according to the quantity of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you will have removed that nail, and there remains nothing of it, then enlarge the wound of the wound if it is broad: and if not, put upon it above with plasters which are convenient for that, and let it glow until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the pin, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Head Six.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed the pin is broken from the front part of the shoulder, and the fracture of it is according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or if it is broken and separated into two, besides which things may happen in the nail, it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or if those things happen in the bone of the nail, it is harder to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or if it is a fracture with a tendon, it is so.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation when the fracture is without a tendon is, that you make the two ministers present, so that one of them holds the helper that follows the broken pin, and the other extends the neck towards the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make an equal break of your fingers until its form is made according to what is appropriate: and there should be no prominence, nor convergence in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you require further extension, then it is necessary that you place a weak, round pouch made of cloth or wool under it: and its size should be according to the amount required by you: and extend, and grasp the elbow, and stretch the pouch with your hand until the equal break is made according to what is appropriate.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you are unable to draw the elbow point outwards due to its flexibility: then it is necessary that the weak one be supported above its own padding: and place a medium-sized pouch under the shoulder of it: and place the shoulder of it at the bottom, until the point of the elbow that is in the deep part rises up to the top: and then correct the equal break with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	However, if you feel a saturation from the elbow: then it is necessary that you place a pouch over it and take out the saturated part with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	However, if it is held in the bone: then use your ingenuity in the incision according to one of the prepared teeth that you have for it, after which you will place the instrument that is suitable for sifach under the elbow: and this instrument should be made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It should resemble the cochlea that does not have convergence.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to what you require from it, with respect to the size of the bone, and its flexibility.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	However, its length should also be according to what is possible for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other should be narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the disruption of the wound which you have cut, when you have extracted the bone splinter, is wide, and the wound is secure from the hot punch: then gather together the two lips of the wound with the suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you fear the hot punch: then fill the wound with gauze, and stitches according to the size of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If the hot punch occurs, then pour oil on rosemary, and vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	However, when the stricture of the bone is without a wound and without a cut, it is, as you will place on the bones an ointment made from flour with albino oil.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft stitch above it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under the spice of that, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the himemate, that is, the wheel which the Saracens hold, which is long and narrow: and its thickness should be about one palm or a little more.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double gauze on top of the stitch and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an astrolabe from a thin table, whose width is three fingers, and its length is also like that.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth around the astrolabe, which is placed on top of the himemate which falls over the fracture and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the himemate over the fracture as it rotates, and wrap it around the neck of that, and under the healthy spice, and under the infirm spice: and reduce it over all parts, and as you see how the stricture holds the fracture strictly decent: and this is what is not hidden from you, and everything, so that the astrolabe does not fall off from the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	You should look at the weak one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the ligament is softened, and you see the star already moving: then correct that, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sleep of the weak one on top of his back, and place under the pillow of his own a small pillow at night, so that when he leans against it, he can help his own side with his helper.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	He then leans on the fracture of the shoulder by the elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie the arm of his shoulder to his own collar: and do not untie the ligament, if it does not happen at the place where the accident happened due to itching, or from an apothecary, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then reapply the plaster if you see the face of his towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the tightening, and release it, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the shoulder is tightened and strengthened according to the most in eighty days: and it happens in some men in a smaller one.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ About the restoration of the fracture of the little bone.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The little bone is hardly broken, and on the side of its width: and they are not broken from it except the edges of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When it is broken from that place, and it is broken in the middle of its width, and it is not known except by touch: then according to the figure of the fracture, prepare his remedy.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And restore it to its natural form in every way possible to your ability.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place the small mill above the wound with a white glove, and a soft stitch, and place the small piece of cloth below it doubled.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on top of it a flat piece from the thin table according to the size of the Spatula of the whole, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed there is flexibility in any place of the Spatula, then equal it with wax gently, until the star descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then cut off with a long, fitting nail, according to the strength of the star, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligament in every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	As much as it is softened, tighten it, and if the star is removed from its place, then let the weak one lie on the sound side of its own.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the Spatula itself will be restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose contribution is not feared, nor their loosening.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however, it proceeds from a bone fragment, and punctures the skin: then cut above it and take it away.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what I have said in the fracture of the wishbone by heating the aposteme, if something comes from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ About the restoration of the fracture of the breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and this does not often happen.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	However, the extremities of it are most broken and crushed by its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of it is broken, which leans to the lower parts, and there happens to it pain in the chest, and difficulties in coughing, and wrackings: and perhaps it lets out blood, and the flexibility of the broken bone is declared in the bone, and is not hidden from the sense, the restoration of it is, that it should lie weakly on the back of its own: and place between the spats of it a piece of wax.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press the shoulders of it, and gather the ribs from two sides or parts with your hands: and make them as equal as possible in this respect, according to all modes that can be used and agreeable, until the figure of the bones is returned, according to what should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place the plaster and ointment on top of it, and place a drop of the fine sugar or salicylic acid tablet, or similar, on the tip of a finger dipped in vinegar, after which you have applied it to the cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make it as fine as possible in tying it over the broken bone, so that it does not come loose: and when you tie it around the back, do so several times according to the roundness, and tighten it accordingly, making it appear decent.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at all times, and as often as it becomes softer, tighten it: and if the necessity of its application to the spot caused by itching, or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess, then immediately dissolve it, and remove the plaster, and rectify what happens with the mode of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see to that face: and attach it to the tight one, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the ribs, when they break.
Caput IX.	Head 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that the breaking of the ribs does not occur except in places that are thick and follow the back, and from the extremities of which it begins from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not occur to them attrition, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses during the inspection with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is made so that the broken bone is tied with fingers according to what is possible, until it is equal in figure, according to what should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then, plasters, and bind the broken bone with a needle, if that is provided.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the shoulder is inclined inwards: then there occurs a painful discomfort, and a pricking, just as the prick that happens to one who has a cold: therefore, because the bone is pricked by it, and also because there are difficulties of coughing, and of sneezing, and of blood in the stools, this is a difficult curative process.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were already skilled in this with many ingenious methods: and among them are those who say that you should put weak foods which generate inflammation and heat, so that the belly may become inflamed, and extended, and the fracture may be forced outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we abhor this, so that there is no cause for the making of a hot gouge, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them have said that a dressing of warm food is put on the place, then it is raised with strength, and it is more like reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, they fear that the warm food attracts excessive vapors to the place, because of the weakness of the position.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them have said that it is necessary to cover the place with wool which has already been dipped in hot oil: and they put flax between the shoulders, until it is filled: so that it may be an equal bandage when it is applied according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the weak cure of the cold is treated with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	And if the weak pain is coerced, which does not tolerate it, and the bone is pricked by the puncture, which is painful, and we fear for the weak one: then it is necessary to cut above the place, and to detach from the broken shoulder.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we will place a second instrument on it that covers the wound, whose reminder precedes: and we will approach the mouth with ease, and we will approach it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture: and we will dress it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If a burning abscess happens to occur meantime, then immediately, and pour ointments of rose oil, and put on top: and the weak one is cured with that which causes the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, also the side is raised over which it sleeps, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	¶ In the restoration of the spine and neck fracture.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Bones of the neck sometimes break, and it rarely happens to them abrasion: and likewise also of the spine.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this happens to someone, and you want to know if it heals or not, then trust.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see its hands already softened, and stunned, and dead: and it cannot move them, nor stretch them, nor contract them: and when you contract them with your fingers, and pierce them with a sharp point, they do not feel it, and they do not feel pain in them: then you know that it does not heal, and it is mortal in many ways.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If it moves them, and feels the contraction with fingers and a sharp point: then you know that the nape of the bones is healthy, and that the weak one will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If you find similar Spine bones to that, and you want to know if it heals also, or not: then consider its feet: then if you see that they are softened, and that happens to them which happens to the hands: then when it lies on its back, it exhales and wastes without will: and when it is raised over its belly, it exhales without will: and when it is raised over its back, and wants to touch it, and cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	You should not worry about its care.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If it does not happen to him from that, it is better.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the care of what happens from that is to apply heat to the wound: thus, put on the spine a warm oil alone, or when you cut it, let it bleed.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Put on it several times in the day until the hot application is sated: then put on a piece of one of the plasters that are comforting, drying, and tie it over it with a ligature: and instruct the patient to use quietness and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the part where he found pain, until he is cured.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens at the attrition of the bones, or something that has already been separated from it, then it is necessary to remove it from the skin and take that away.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather two lips of the wound, if it is large, with the suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some ointment, until it is cured.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If it happens that the last bone of the tail is broken, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to insert the left hand finger into the anus, and adjust the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and secondly according to the proportion.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put on it, and take it away: and care for the knee with the care that precedes, until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ Regarding the restoration of Ancha.
Caput XI.	¶ Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Rarely do the bones of Ancha break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they break, then the fracture of their bones is not, except a comminution at their extremities: and they are divided in length, and turn towards the interior: and there occurs pain in the place, and puncture: and the thigh that is broken becomes still.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	The restoration of it is indeed, that you extend your hand over it, until you see the figure of it as it is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then adjust the equal fracture according to what is prepared for you from the equation, until it resembles the natural figure of its own.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	However, if the fracture is in length or has already leaned towards the interior, then make the weak side lie over its own vent, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have adjusted it yourself, place the plaster over it: then place the star made of wood or from the skin above it, and tighten the stretching over it, not fearing the permutation of the fracture, nor the removal of the star.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And adjust the equality of those with that which will fill it, until it takes the tightening according to equality: and make the weak one lie down on his back or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	However, if a hot sponge occurs on it: then stop from extending it, and its restoration, until the hot sponge is seated: and place over it what is seated on it, according to what precedes, then return to the restoration of it, and tighten it as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	However, if a bone splinter or is broken: remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	About the restoration of the fracture of Adiutorius.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	Adiutorius is that which is between the thighs up to the head of the Spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	However, if it breaks, then the restoration of it is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: take a flat wood of the middle size, according to this form which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	The two ligaments are tied at two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then the patient is hung from the elevated position, and the weak one sits on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm over the log, until it reaches the handle of the log, on which the middle of the log's rope is fastened.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang something heavy above him, so that it extends to his lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor examines the patient's broken bone with his own hands, until the fracture is healed according to what is appropriate.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And there is another way, so that the weak one sits on his own neck: and hang the patient's hand from his neck with the rope.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command the two attendants to hold one of them with his hand above the fracture, and the other below it, and each of them should hold onto their own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want it to be an extension stronger, then tie under the fracture with the rope, and above it with another rope: and each of them should extend it to their own two parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary to put one ligament under the handle, and the other under the broken shoulder blade.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the shoulder blade, then it is necessary to put the ligament above that place, and above the shoulder blade itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then make the fracture as equal and easy as possible without labor, until it is healed according to what is appropriate, and apply it with a good application: then tie it, if there is no heat from the burn.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however, a fever occurs, then release the tied one until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	After placing the lint on top of it, dip it in vinegar and rose oil until the swelling subsides: then tighten it: and the way to tie it is to place the plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a moistening compress made of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he should bring his arm up to the aid and place his open hand on his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place the lint on it, and tie it over the aid arm so that the arm stands in the position of the stars: if nothing prevents you from doing so, nor does anything fall on you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If you fear that something may fall on you from the broken bone, then use the stars: and it is proper to place the star which is larger and stronger than the others over the fracture itself.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place all the stars between the fingers: and the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with an addition of three digits from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie a stricture over the stars as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is proper that your stricture be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is extended, the smaller the stricture should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you see the position of the stars and the stricture as I said, then do so immediately when you restore the limb: and if you fear heat swelling, then release the stricture and the stars until the seventh day, as I said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days to see if it does not happen in the place of itching, or swelling, or is forbidden by food to come near the limb because of the excessive tightness of the stricture.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, correct this entirely according to what I said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you have confidence that nothing will happen from it, then you do not cut the ligament unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And if he is weak and sleeps on his back, and his hand on his stomach, and place under support a full linen cloth equal.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider in all hours of the night or day that the figure of the broken member does not tear, or the ligament is not softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, correct this entirely with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food on the weak according to the order we prescribe, so that the food is soft at the beginning, until it begins to tighten the mouth: then it is necessary to make the food of that one softer.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the custom of support and the thigh is, that it tightens in forty days: then therefore it is necessary to cut it, and give a bath, and apply ointments that strengthen that one.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is a ugly one, then drawn out: then do not cut the ligament and stars up to fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the Bragg's arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter thirteen.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is made up of two bones, which are called the two foci.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps only the larger focus is broken, or the small one: and perhaps they are broken at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller focus is broken above, then the restoration of it is easy, and the healing of it is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	When the fire-wire below is broken, it is a bad break and the healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If the bone that is broken is a fire-wire above, then it is convenient for the doctor during the restoration of his bone, to apply a slight extension with ease, until it is strong enough.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the fire-wire is large that is broken: then it is necessary for him to apply a stronger tightening bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary for him to apply a hand figure at the restoration of his bone, and the extended extension over the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the hand should be higher than all fingers of the other: and the inferior articulation should be on all fingers or others: and the weak one sitting quadratus over himself, and the pulley in front of him, or in his directness, at his height, so that the weak one does not incur the labor of the weak hand.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he should extend the servant's arm from the lower part, or with his own arm, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the servant should also extend above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor's bone should be strong enough to reduce it according to the better figure that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If indeed there are tags in the bones' fractures: then you may dare to reduce all fragment in its place with your virtue.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed there appears to be a separate tag in it, and the skin is punctured, and there is no hope for its restoration: then find above it, and remove it according to the mode that I have mentioned for those that were previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If indeed the fracture is with a tendon, I have already made to that particular one, then take care of its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If indeed a hot aphorism occurs at the beginning of your restoration: then line the bandage with the oil-rosy gutter, and white gutter, and it should be between the thickness and the fineness: and tie the bandage on the stricture subtle, until it is sated the aphorism: then remove the gutter, and put the prepared plaster from the flour with albumen oui.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place the stars, and let the star that is placed over the fracture be somewhat larger and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And you know that the number of the stars of Brachii is six in several arrangements: whether the fracture is in one bowl, or in two bowls at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place the stricture of your own over the stronger and more violent place of the fracture, and somewhat more towards the upper or lower part of the fracture, or let the stricture be of a softer kind, according as the remembrance of it occurs at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that cover the fracture be soft and moist, not hard and sharp.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread by which it is tied be from the proper linen, of a middle between the fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and the ligament after a day.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens which requires rectification, such as the prickling that occurs in the member: then it is necessary to wet the member with hot water until the prickling stops, and to release the member that is not constricted, until it stops, and then repeat the stricture.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture has already been softened, and the mouth is remote, and similar to this: then rectify that entirely with your own virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prohibited from being applied to the member because of the excessiveness of the stricture: then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and release it for a few days, until it runs towards the food, and then tie it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if something does not happen to injure those things which we have said: then it is not necessary to untie, unless after twenty days, or about these.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the weak person is hung to its neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let its neck be equal, and guard it by the strength of its movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make it sleep over its back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days, or in thirty-two days, and perhaps in nineteen days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The entire thing is according to the dispositions of complexions, and the dispositions of strengths.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	§ About the healing of hand fractures.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that finger fractures on the hand are rare with nails and toes.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to it unless frequent wear.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When then the plantar fracture or wear happens, it should be that the weak person lies in a square position: and there should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place its hand over the extended one.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant extends the broken bone, and adjusts it by the doctor until they are joined in a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it should be that he puts on plaster and bandage, if not a hot sore happens.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the stell on the top according to the quantity of the place: and you have already applied it in a linen bandage.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is to the lower part of the plantar part approximately, then make a similar sphere from linen: and tell the weak person to lie on it with his broken foot: then bind it with a long bandage.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the stell be of leather, in which there is lenity, so that the corium may apply to the body of the plant with the foot: and bind it according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is to the outside, then it should be done thus: place a needle downwards, and another from below in the sole of the foot: the hand should be straight and open.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place the spasm, as the hand rotates: and extend the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If however a fracture occurs to some of the phalanges of the finger, then if it is the thumb, it should be done accordingly.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie with the sole: and if you love, place a straight needle on it, small: so it will open the fracture, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is to the remaining digits, such as the middle, index, and little fingers, then it should be done accordingly, and a needle should be placed with the healthy one that follows it: or they can all be tied according to the continuation: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small needle on top of the one we have already mentioned in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that place hot spikes: and oppose with it when something happens from it according to the report of its story.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ About the restoration of the hip bone fracture.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken, and it is declared by touch: because it turns to the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is made in such a way that the ligament above the fracture is tied, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And it is weakened by being stretched over its face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then all the ligaments that are ministering to their part are extended according to equality: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then it should be a ligament to the part of the tendon, so that the extension goes upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	If the proximal fracture of the knee is, then the proximal ligament of the knee should be extended to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should adjust the bone of both hands until it is reduced according to the natural figure's similarity: and then it should be united by a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage if there is no aposteme of the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If it happens in that aposteme of the member: then let him leave it for some days until the hot aposteme is settled, and then return to your own care.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, this bandage should be.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to tie over the hard fracture of the bone, that is, the binding: and then tie it twice or three times: and let there remain some excess on it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then tie the thigh, until the heel of the calf passes at the root of the fingers.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the thigh near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the thigh and the hip that remains from the dough.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place on the hip in the place of the fracture of its stars, and place one star over the bone of the thigh.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill up the vacancies between the thigh and the hip with soft bandages so that the bandage is equal to the bandage.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture, three or four times.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And as much as you can stretch with the ligament from the place of the fracture, your bandage should be smaller and softer, and softer.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pay attention to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and the thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Band then when both three stars which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then with the two extremities of the finger to the lower parts, until the nails to the sole of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And when also both strings and the extremities of the stars from the other part, so that the band does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the tightened band over that, while it remains, so that there is no corrosion of the member, nor epidermis, nor inflammation, and such like.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, when the solution of it, and correct that which happens from this, according to what we have said often.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If however a fragment is in the bone which pains: then it is necessary to adjust it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above that, and remove that: and care with which precedes the reminder, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is tied, besides which stars are added to it, as we have said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	Nevertheless in the restoration of it so fractured, there happens not to the patient a weakness of walking.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides which another thigh is applied to it, then it is necessary that he who has it, always walks weakly.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you know that the hip is tied for fifty days, or added little, or diminished a little: all this is according to the diversity of the complexions, and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	¶ About the restoration of the fracture of the knee-joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter Sixteen.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that the knee-joint fracture rarely happens, but it happens to it often a tearing.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture occurs, then either a fissure or a hole in some of its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is when with the elbow, and without the elbow.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over that completely with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is so that it becomes equal to what was disrupted from its parts with fingers, until it is aggregated and united according to what is possible from an equation and facility and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place the plaster made from sieve or mill flour, and with almond: and place on top of it a round star, if you need that: and wind around it conveniently to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have mentioned in the other fractures, such as hot burn, and like it: so that you place every accident with what is convenient to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the thigh fracture.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	You know that the thigh is made up of two bones, one of which is large and is called the thighbone, and the other is small and is called the focus bone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that both kinds of fractures that occur in the two bones of the arm are similar, and therefore the restoration of it is made equal to the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If they break two bones at the same time, the thigh is changed to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the small bone is broken, the thigh is changed to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the large bone is broken, you will find it lower, and it is one of those that do not hide anything from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer the extension, the equation, and the binding of the stars equally according to that.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Indeed, if the fracture of the thigh is a severe one, bearing many seths, then it should be a less extension, and your healing will be gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the thigh indeed, there is something from the shoulder operation: and it is, when you make equal stars, and cover all your operation, then take two strips from pine wood, which is given in the making of solar panels that is laid under slabs: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them those which have small grossness, and neither be small: and their length should be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then cover over each strip with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And lay one part of the thigh on one part, and the other on the other: and they should be from the knee downwards to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	Since extension is forbidden, the thigh inclines to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And the swaddling is already made of wood according to the length of the thigh, and the thigh is laid on it to keep it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And it is especially important that you do this when the fracture is properly healed.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the thigh every day, and study with it the last effort of the nail, or inflammation, or other similar things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If something happens from these, then oppose it with that which is proper, until he is cured, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	About the fracture of the bone of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel itself does not frequently undergo a complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	In the bones of the foot, a fracture sometimes occurs, and even a slight one can occur on the toes: it does not occur except in cases of wear and tear in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see the bone rising above itself to be inserted into something, then the weaker foot will place its foot on the prepared ground, just as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and place your foot on that which is raised from those bones: then press or shoe it: and hold it in the same position until it returns to its own places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place the plaster on, and remove the bandage: and place under the sole of the foot a small table with two flat caps.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tie it with the foot tightly, after you have loosened it with the bandages, and with the rest that is needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When they have been tied for three days, or four, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bone equal, if it be fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is therefore as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If however some toes are broken, then restore them, and make them equal as I will tell you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger with the star according to the length of the toe, and make it a little larger than that: then place under the foot the table which I have told you, and tie it tightly.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however that which is broken is two, or three, or more, then place the star of its own quantity over all the fingers, loosened in linen: and tie the table under the sole of the foot: and let it stand on one cap of the table outside the sole of the foot, to keep a good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	It happens to you that you do not overlook, but consider all that I have said to you about the remaining fractures from the accidents that we have mentioned: and compare every accident with what should be done.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	¶ Of the fracture of the woman's Vulva, and the bones of the shoulders, and of women.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's Vulva is broken, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her towards the side of her own back, and hold her back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife shall fill the woman's Vulva with the cot, until it is full: and it shall be in the Vulva as a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman shall be stirred, and slowly raise the back of her.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	This cot will exit, until it becomes a sphere before the Vulva door, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a pillow under her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wishes to urinate, remove the cot with ease, then urinate: and then return it according to the way you introduced it at first: and then return to her own pillow first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or about, as the bone will be restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a catheter, and tie over the opening of the hole with flax, and insert the catheter entirely into her Vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the catheter with force, until the catheter is inside the Vulva, as the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill with the cot, and stand for a few days according to what we have mentioned, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the shoulders is broken, then administer for its restoration and according to the ratio we have mentioned in the bone of Anchae.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	The correct path is not hidden in these nearby fractures which are minor, especially if one has some knowledge or experience of the subject.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	Understand my book thoroughly, for the fracture itself indicates to you in many positions of the limb a right line for restoration and strengthening of it, so understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the virga of the strength is broken, take the gut of a goose and insert the virga into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place the cloth fold over it and it will be moistened and released after three days, or about that time, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	¶ Regarding the restoration of a bone fracture when there is with a splint.
Caput XX.	Head 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is helpful to him who has a fracture with a splint, especially if it is a large one, such as the hip bone, or an aid, or similar to it, so that you can do it quickly, and if the conditions for phlebotomy are apparent to you, as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the splint lets blood, then it is necessary to do it as soon as possible for its abscission, so that you can grind the powder on top of it: if there is no other for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in that same day: and do not postpone this if it does not happen to be an apoplexy.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If however an apoplexy hot happens, then release the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the apoplexy has settled.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days, for you are making bad things happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is prominent above the detected skin: then it is necessary to do it so that you can reduce and make it equal with your hands, with facility and extension small.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however the extension of this is not prepared by you and your own equilibrium with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And the instrument made of iron, whose length is equal to seven digits or eight, and whose width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the quantity he needs for the care of this kind of fracture in every way.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round: and there should be small thickness in it, so that it does not double on the compression above it in the hour of the operation: and it should have sharp ends, with a margin at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And it should be above it according to the thickness from the middle of it to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of it.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation it is necessary to place the sharp cut end of it over the prominent end of the bone: and push it with that hand until the bone returns and equilibrates a certain equilibrium.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, let us try to make the ends of the fracture equal.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the ends of this fracture are fine and the instrument does not take it well, then let him try to break the end of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them with the one we have described, then break it with the one we have mentioned: or cut it with any kind of saw that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth out that which remains in the bone from the roughness and minute thorns.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced and it finds a weak painful and harmful feeling after its reduction, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do this then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	However, you are performing a great injury to the patient when you complete the restoration of his bone that you are doing.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the bandage in a solution of black vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a poultice on the joint, nor anything containing oil, so that it does not happen to happen in the very putrefaction and decay.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer stars in the hour of your completion of the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And release the detected joint: so that you may happen with the finger holes in the inflammation according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be careful not to pull the joint with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Indeed, many have done this stupidly by the doctors: and they have made it happen to their weak ones, or death, or decay, or zuchem, that is, health.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your restriction should be soft, gentle, and varied in the remaining restrictions of the fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the joint is bad, or is a large joint, and you think some bad things have happened to it, and you find pain in the place hanging up: then it does not need to be placed with stars on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them inflammations from hard bandages in the place of the stars, and pull them with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the joint already beginning to come out, so that pus is generated in it: then take away the bandage that you have placed over it with vinegar.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer linen, and ointment with which we are accustomed to heal wounds, as the tetrapharmacont ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	It happens to you that you dissolve the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	Consider the wound every morning and evening until it is healed and cured.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the member be prepared in such a way that the pus flows from it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If the wound days pass without it being healed and the pus does not flow from it, then you know that there are small bones broken in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound when touched.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of these are broken, remove them and take it out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And if any of them are not separated and they prick the member and cause pain, you may try to insert it and remove it in any way that is possible for you to do this.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If the wound becomes inflamed, swollen, or discolored, that is, if there is another sign of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply one of them with the member that is being cured from which the preceding narrative in the chapter belongs.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from which you must say my word and to which you make your present mind when the bone is broken and it comes over the member, as the hip bone, the shoulder, and similar ones in the large members, so that you do not assume attraction of it, for death often happens from it, and even let it go until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it may fall off by itself in nineteen or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then you should care for the wound if you see it to you: and if not, let it go.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	¶ About the curing of the nodation in the wound of the fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This happens that this nodation is in the way of healing of the fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, which is near the joints: and it becomes unsightly from this figure of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it forbids the member to its own natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider then, if the nodation is recent: administer to it medicines which have stiptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and such like.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some of these, or all of them: and confine them with vinegar stiptic, or albumen ointment, or acetic ointment: and place them over the nodation in a dressing, and bind them over the good stricture of the same.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the stricture, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loose it, and put on another, until the nodation is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or, bind it over the same leaden slice.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property to remove everything that is feared from the members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodation has already been turned to stone, and is strict, and a hurry is needed to remove it: then find over it from its upper part, and cut off the overflowing excrescence: or scrape it with some razors, until it is removed: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	¶ About the curing when it is restored, and the member remains after that subtle, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of the bones is restored, and the member remains after that subtle, weak: then this is not made except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, multitude of the solutions and ligations of its ligaments not according to what should be: or because of the excess of the stricture of the ligaments, until it is forbidden nourishment to run to the member: or because of the excess of the embrocation in its own hour: or because of the smallness of blood in the body of the weak, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	The care of his body is to make food for him weak and tender, until blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a plaster on the member: so that it attracts the plaster to the food much.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And he should apply ointment to his member with hot water, until the food runs out and returns to its natural figure.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	¶ About the curing of broken bones when they are twisted.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that the member is already restored after the healing of its wound, and the broken bone is prominent, or nodated: and it becomes deformed through this form of the member, nevertheless the member should not be forbidden from its natural operation: then it does not need to accept the speech of him who thinks that the bone is broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many stupid doctors and restorers who have done this on our earth.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed useless, leading to death, or great fear, so that it may be deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	Verily if the claudication and nodation are recent: then it is necessary that he be applied with hot water, in which decoctions are made of herbs that mollify, such as the leaves of the higher plant, and the root of it, and mellilot, and those similar to them.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let him make a plaster with the mollifying ointment, such as dyachilon made appropriately.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let him take mucilage of the higher plant root, and mix with chicken fat, or with essence of winter squash: and it shall be applied with this.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let him take ripe figs, and wrap them with thread made of fine wool, and those similarly named from diminishing medicines to strengthen the consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	When the knot is untied with constant, old, and gentle rubbing, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the movement of the member is given to every part in all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however, the tortuosity has already preceded, and has been made strong, and it has been turned towards the stone, and a necessity for its caution has been provoked with iron: then it is necessary to cut off what has been said above, and to untie the continuity of the bones, and to let it be that which is superfluous from the knot or bone with the sharp incisors: and ease is given in that with caution and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	¶ Regarding speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is forbidden from its own movement, and its figure is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes to happen upon the weakest pain and severe wounds.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When then a dislocation happens to someone, it is necessary to hasten to the restoration of that: and it does not delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it delays, the place will be postponed, and perhaps with it the restoration of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it does not need to move, nor to extend in the hour of its postponement.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes the spasm, and the painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, it is necessary to hasten to phlebotomy of the weak one.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is released, until the postponement rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is brocaded with the warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every member is cared for with that of which the memory does not wish to be in its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I myself have already arranged the chapter of dislocation, even according to what precedes in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	¶ About the care of the dislocation of the inferior mandible.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles are rarely dislocated except.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the inferior is made according to one or two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are moved from their places by removal of a small part, and are perhaps softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated in a complete and full dislocation, until they are softened to the part of the chest, until the weak pulse is flowed, and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and the tongue of it is loosened with its speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when the dislocation of it is small, it returns to many positions by itself with little.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however the dislocation is complete and full: then it is necessary that it be given to its return lightly, and not delayed too much: and it is that it holds the weak head of the minister: and the physician inserts the thumb of his own hand into the root of the dislocated mandible, if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he may insert both of his thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining digits of his hand are outside, by which he can do it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And he commands the weak one, to cleanse his mandibles, and to free them for eating to all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician can move the mandible, and presses the mandible, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	What if however the return of it is difficult, especially if both mandibles are at once: then he gives the softening with hot water and oil, until a easy return of the inferior is made: and he does not delay the reduction of the inferior at all, as I said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are cut and sutured, and the wound is closed without being softened, then place some pieces of beeswax above them, with a little thorn made of wax, and some rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then, it is applied with ease, with flexible ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	Then, a soft pillow is placed on the back of the patient, and the head of the patient is held between two pieces of beeswax, so that it does not sway to the right or left. It does not voluntarily chew or masticate anything, rather, a food of its choice is placed on its jaw, until the pain subsides and the jaw is sutured. Then, it eats what it wants, and the food is administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	The patient does not labor over the operation of its own mouth during eating and drinking, and until the jaw is sutured, and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they are dislocated in a certain hour and do not return to their original position, then there may be many fevers and frequent sweating, and perhaps the weak intestines are loosened, and perhaps the sour choler is swallowed.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see this, then you know that it is a loss, and that person dies in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Regarding the reduction of the shoulder joint dislocation and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The shoulder joint, however, is not dislocated from the inside of the shoulder, because of the continuity of its bone with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside: and this is declared by touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is such that it lies weakly on its back, and extends its arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then, the joint is placed in a strong position with your palm, because it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place the plaster over it, and the swabs, and tie it up.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The ends of these, which follow the knee, and are continuous with it, are rarely dislocated.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated on any day: then it should be reduced and made equal as we have said, and prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place the plaster over it, the swabs, and the tied-up one.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the nurse to remain calm and quiet until it heals.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when the same treatment is applied to the end of the arm, when it separates even from its own place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ About the reduction of the shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is, that it be dislocated to the part of the shoulder-blade towards the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it be dislocated to the part of the breast.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it may be dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, because of the nail.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most frequently dislocated and goes out to the lower part, opposite the shoulder-blade: especially in those, where the flesh is least.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it goes out quickly from them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those where the flesh is much, it goes out against it, because it goes out with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens in some men by a blow, or accident, and the shoulder is broken off hot, and it is thought that it is dislocated because of that.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	You must then try this, until you are certain of it, and then proceed to treat it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And a dislocation is known when the head is turned towards the lower part of the shoulder; and you can distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a normal one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find a union in the head of the humerus, and at the point where the head of the humerus is touched, it seems to be one piece: and it cannot be easily moved by the weak hand to its own shoulder, nor moved at all by any motion.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if the shoulder is dislocated to the side or upwards: you will find a clear touch, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this dislocation is easy to reduce when it is recent, or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And the reduction of this is that he should raise his own hand to the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your own hands under the head of it, and raise the joint with strength to the upper part of its own place: and he will raise his own hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he will put it down lower, for he returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not return by what I said, and the days that pass are many from the beginning of the dislocation: then it is necessary for the weak one to be bathed in hot water, and an ointment should be applied which softens and soothes, as if the roots of tall plants, such as garden radishes, and melilot, were being cut off and dipped in water, and the ointment is applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weak one should rise on his back, and a sphere and wool which is equal in softness to gentleness and strictness should be placed under the head of it.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician will place his heel upon the sphere, and he will lift up the head of the shoulder with gentleness, and he will attract the weak hand to the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another shall hold the weak head, so that it does not move towards the lower parts: for he returns immediately himself.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this manner: and it should be as if a stronger man were present, standing on the side, and he would insert his hand under the weak one, and he would lift up the weak one's hand to the upper parts, until it becomes weak and suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another shall draw the weak hand of his towards the lower vents of him.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the weak one is close: then it is necessary that he hangs something else with him, so that it grieves him, for he returns to dislocation immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another manner: and it should be as if a long log of wood, whose head is round figure, like the handle of a mortar: which is not heavy, nor very light.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then the soft cloths will be placed upon the weak one, after they have been placed upon the head of the log: and the weak one should stand according to the length of the log.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand and body are extended from the other side, and he is joined with force from the other side, for the dislocation returns to its place with weakness.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if it is difficult for him to be reduced by all that I have said, then use this care: and it should be as if a log whose length is the quantity of two forearms, and whose width is the quantity of four fingers, and whose grossness is the quantity of two fingers: whose head is round, so that the entrance of his wrist may go deep into the hollow of the thumb, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then, they bind a loose linen bandage around the round head, so as not to harm the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then, they place it under the weak arm or shoulder, so that the hand extends as far as the wooden support; and they tie the wood to the aid and the hand and finger end.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then, they place the shoulder over the step of the ladder along its length, and the hand extends to the lower parts, while the rest of the body is suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The knot is immediately entered.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When the opening of this is completed according to whatever manner is possible: then it is necessary to place under the weak arm a sphere of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then, place the prepared plaster made from flour with almond and albumin on the entire arm, as it rotates above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then, tie the narrow bandage according to fit: and the cord rolls above the plaster: and the hand of this is connected to the neck of the same, and it is suspended, and the hand of this does not move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to place a weak food, until the member is strengthened, because it is more suitable for its cure.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then, a larger one is placed after seven days, or five, and it is moved with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it holds firm and is not softened, then it is already cured.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the knot is dislocated often due to moisture that occurs to it, or for some other cause: then it is necessary to apply the cauterant with three holes, according to what was mentioned in the chapter of cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is done entirely, and the cord is loosened after seven days, and the knot does not hold the joint, and the plaster and bandage are applied again several times, and does not hold, and falls, and cannot be raised to its upper part: then you know that the bones of his arm which are near the head of the shoulder, have already been cut, extended, or softened: and you know that the knot is never made in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	When the breast and nipple are dislocated, or if it is reduced to the back, it is done with a push and extension of the hands. Until it returns, and the remaining tightness and care are given, it will heal.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, there is old age in the member, and slowness in its movement, then a weak bath is used often, until that old age is relieved and it returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	¶ Treatment of the Dislocation of the Shoulder.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the dislocation of the shoulder is difficult, and it also returns with difficulty, and even so, it is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the front and back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it is falling under use, and under touch, according to whatever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you reduce the dislocated shoulder to the sound one, that is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint is concealed, and it cannot double the shoulder, nor touch its own arm with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to do this as soon as possible, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before it becomes cold apostema.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if it becomes cold apostema, it is difficult to reduce it: and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is to the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in all kinds of dislocations and painful ones: and it often dies with them.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it is, when it can be reduced, to extend the hand of that member with two hands: and the shoulder of that member is expanded, and the hand of the physician is above the shoulder and under it, and he pushes the joint with the fingers of his own hands simultaneously, or with the root of the palm of his own hand, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	If indeed it is a dislocation to the front: then it returns thus, so that the hand doubles with its own hand, until it strikes with the root of its palm, which is dislocated, with the cubit.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then administer a strong extension, with great force: and it is as if two hands were extending the arm: and hold it firmly by two hands even so that it does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is turned over to all parts after it has been reduced on the palm of the hand, whether it be the doubled band or the wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when it touches the physician's hand with the joint, anoint it with oil: so that this be one of those which aid in the ease of the joint with lubricity.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then let him press the joint with a strong impulse, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction of it, it is proper that it be laid on the same plaster, wherein there is stipticity, and excitation with the bone, and that it be tied in a proper manner.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang the arm from the weak neck: and let it be for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it shall be unwound.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If the joint is firm in its place, then unbind the ligament from it, and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well to be bound, then repeat the plaster, and the ligament, and let it go for some days, until it be bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then let it go.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however, old age happens to it after the reduction of the joint, and the position is in motion: then administer hydromelaration in the bath, and subtle friction, and compression, until it be tightened, or be laid upon the joint, that is, the fatty nates of the heels.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is laid on, and let it be given to her day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take it away, and then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When she is washing, then rub the joined friction with gentle heat.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over her affected part three times, and second time, and third time after inserting into the bath, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you will, place over her excrement a moist, heated buttermilk with care, and tie it over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	She will become softened, and return to its original position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ About the treatment of Almahassem dislocations.
Caput XXIX.	Caput XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The hand of Mahassem is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the shoulder and the arm.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of her dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	And the other joints are difficult to reduce.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that the ease of reduction of her dislocated hand be in the hour in which it is dislocated, before the wound is closed: or it happens at the same time as the heat of the wound.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of her dislocated hand is that you place Mahassem's weak hand over the table, and extend her other hand: and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and presses it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that it be considered, if the palm has already returned to the chest of the hand: then she places her weak back over the table at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of her hand is intrinsic over the table, that is, the interior part of her hand is placed over the prominence of the joint, so that the hand of the physician falls on its own prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then grasp it with a plaster while it is seated post-amputation, and let it go, do not repeat this.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	If it does not bear the reduction, nor can you perform it after three days have passed, nevertheless the union remains according to its twists and turns: and nothing harms the patient except that the hand is softened, and nothing can be tightened: then you know that the nerves are either cut or torn.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no genius in this, unless it is tied with a cauterant near its wound.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not harm anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When Almahassem does not return, then place the plaster we mentioned above on it.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is tied and released for five days: after that, it is loosened and released, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however the movement of it is impeded, and something of stiffness occurs in it: then soothe it with warm water, and friction several times, until it is eased.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	¶ Treatment of the Dislocation of the Digits.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a digit is dislocated from one of them to all parts, or from one of them to the back of the palm, or to its ventrum: then extend the digit with your fingers, and press the displacement with your fingers until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the digit, and suspend the opposite part to which it is dislocated for two days, and let it go.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it until it is straight in its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When it is night, tie it according to the description: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and exercise it with motion: and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	This should be done after a few days, once it is tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly, when it is dislocated to the ventrum of the hand: and tie it to the same part, and perform your first operation with it, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly, when it is dislocated to other parts: and perform your operation as before.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	¶ Regarding the treatment of dislocation of the dorsal spine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When a dorsal spine dislocation occurs, or a complete dislocation of the collarbone, or many vertebrae are moved from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death comes to the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the weak ones go out without will, and cannot hold it, and often some of their limbs are made soft by it, or both thighs, or both arms of his, or one of them: or the dislocation is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it is often removed because it is often removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the posterior part, is called gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of this is that you should consider then, if gibbosity occurs from infancy: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in those which happen from accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken of the methods of curing with a long discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Which is not returned with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have already abbreviated from that, which is not excused by much of its proximity to my own: and from my exposure, in which I showed it, and formed the instrument of it in a different way from what they showed it, and they also exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I declare that there is no genius or cure from such a tumor that occurs from the front part.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly, in those that occur to both sides, also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless those that happen in the back properly, as I say: and it is, that the weak extends over its face above the podium equal to the wall near the parietum: and it is expanded under it with a wet humid stramentum, so that it does not hurt the chest of its.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight log is placed fixed in the fork on the ground, at the end of the foot, near the head of its: and another log, approximately at the other end of its foot: and it holds the log, and it is not firm in the fork.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And it holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then it covers over the weak head, and under the loose ligament of its, gently firm, and extends the end of the ligament to the log that is at its head: and it ties it in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then it ties another ligament above its loose belly, and above its knees, and at its thighs.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then it gathers all the ligaments together, and ties them in the other log that is at its feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then it extends all the helper to the part of the log ligament, and the two logs are not removed from their places where they are fixed: however they are not firm as I say.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician will put his hands over the spine with strength, until he returns: or he will put over it a table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he will connect above the table his feet, until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not return by this cure, then take the table whose length is approximately three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	The causa in the wall from which we said that it is near the weakest part, is the place where the extremity of the tablet enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the tablet over the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician will place his feet on the opposite extremity.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tie it well, until the spine coils around, and return to its own place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if you wish, to operate with the turned part of the arm that is covered by your hand: and it should be as if you are placing two sticks in the ground near the weakest part of the foot, in the final part of the two legs, whose length is equal to the bicep of one: and near the head of this foot in the final part of the two legs.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length that is between all the sticks of one palm: and it has already been made in every place where the turned part runs: and the entire stick should be firmly placed on the ground much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round stick should be inserted: and it is the turned part in which the ligament rotates in two holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the extreme end of it is a hole, in which the stick is firmly placed, whose length is equal to the palm of that one with which it rotates, and in two other sticks it is similar to this.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the ligaments that you have tied in the weak chest with the turned part that is near the head of this foot: and tie the ligaments that you have tied in the legs with the turned part that is near the feet of this leg.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand near all the turned parts that turn the hand with the thumb, with which it rotates: and the physician should place the spine according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turned part that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the sponge has returned, and the place is prepared, it is then necessary to put on a plaster of ichthyol with albumen.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, apply the stupe.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then, place above the plaster a star-shaped piece of paper, whose width is three digits or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And the length of it should be such that it takes up the place of Gibbosity, and over a part of the healthy sponge.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then, it is wrapped with the tie we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And a weak nourishment of fine substance is used until it heals.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there remains some prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and ease, with the administration of the paper we have mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And already, lead is being administered in that layer.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes, a prominence occurs at the end of the spine of the back: and it is supposed to be a displacement, and that is the bone that has already protruded.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it is not necessary for a presumption to be made in him with this medicine: perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ About the treatment of Anchae's dislocation.
Caput XXXII.	¶ Head 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the joints of Anchae and the joints of the elbow do not happen unless it is a dislocation only: nor does it happen to them that happens to other joints from removal and concoction.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of Anchae does indeed dislocate according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated to the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is most dislocated to the inside: and it is least dislocated to the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	The treatment for this dislocation is to bring the joint inwards because when you join a weak bone with a healthy one, it is further apart: and the knee of this patient is higher than the healthy one, and the weak cannot double its step at the groin: and there is a place that follows the groin, which is burned after the thigh bone is struck, therefore, because the head of the hip has already become wet there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The sign of this dislocation that occurs on the outside is what are its opposite events.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The sign of this dislocation that occurs on the front is because the healthy bone expands according to the complement: nevertheless, it does not double itself without pain in the knee: and if it attempts to walk, it cannot go over that to the front: and it retains its urine, and it strikes the groin of its own, and there is a cushioning of its own above the heel during walking.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The sign of this dislocation that occurs on the back is that it does not expand the knee, and it cannot double it before doubling the groin: and the bone of its own is also shorter on the other side: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the place of that.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation is as follows: that you consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has been for a long time with having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you perform the reduction of this dislocation and it remains according to its own disposition: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it does not follow that there should be a presumption of its being completely reduced.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that one whose dislocation is recent and is of one of the four kinds of dislocations: then, in order to this, if you wish to join it, extend it both towards the interior and towards the exterior, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return, and there will be no need for another care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If this method does not return, then it is necessary to prepare a strong servant and extend the thigh of his crus from below: either with his own hands or with the bandage that is laid on top of his crus above the knee: and another servant extends his hand over his, so that he inserts his hand under the shinbone of his.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tighten with a soft bandage over the hip bone and hold the other end of the bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And it should be extended either from the front of the thigh to the shoulder, or from the back to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And it should be extended uniformly until the weak one lifts his body off the ground and hangs down.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	This is the species of extension, which is common to the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If this dislocation returns with the one I mentioned earlier, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for the entire species that I will mention for the treatment of this.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of this, when the dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the weak one hangs down on his own healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should put the bandage over the hip bone, in the place that is between the head of the hip and the place under the thigh.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he should extend the bandage upwards from the thigh to the higher part of the body, to the shoulder.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then he should take a strong servant's arm and reduce the place of the weak thigh, and extend it with a strong extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now it returns to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	This is the easiest of the others in the treatment of this member.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however it is excused from you, and does not obey you to enter with this species of treatment entirely: then it is necessary that two weak feet be tied together with a strong but soft bandage over the two heels, and over the two knees: and the length of each should be according to the quantity of four toes: and the weak leg should be extended more than twice the quantity of two toes.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one is hanged over the head of the wooden beam that is in the house, and its length is as much as two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then the strong youth is commanded to cover the head of the thighs, and it is hung with the weak one on another: and the strong youth presses the other, covering the thighs with strength, for the joint returns to its own place with weakness.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of its own kind, when it is dislocated to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lies over the foot, according to what we have said about having a knob.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the bandage is tied over the thigh of the weak one, properly, and over his breast.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are placed, one at his foot, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a additional beam is placed in the middle of the foot, fixed well: over which the wet belts are placed so that it does not hurt the weak one: and the beam should be between the thighs of the weak one so that it does not attract to the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the helpers extend to their own part, and the physician applies the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If then he obeys to the reuersion, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place over the same table, and press it, as we have said about the knob, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the weak one lies over his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weak thigh is extended widely: and this is according to the same report over the foot: and the physician places his right hand palm on the weak groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he bends it with his other hand, and with that bending places the extended one to the lower parts of the knee to the part of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	If the dislocation is to the back: then it does not necessitate that the weak one extend to the lower parts, and that he be raised above the ground: indeed, it is necessary that he be placed above the hard thing, just as it is necessary that he be placed in that position even if the dislocation is far outward, according to what we said about his reclining on two of its sides: and he is above his face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we said earlier.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that the compression be given with the table even when he is on his way to the place of the joint, when the reduction is complete according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that he extends the two weak legs: and when you see them equal, and the weak one draws in his leg, and expands it without excuse, then you know that the member has returned according to what is necessary: then join the two thighs, and put on plaster, and tie with a tight roll, that is, a ring: thus, so that it does not move too far to any part: and it adheres quietly for three or four days, or five.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in state, then you know that the dislocation is now firm: therefore, let the weak one walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something of softening: then return, and the plaster that, and tie it according to your first tightness: and let him be without it for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen that and make him walk slowly over a few days on both sides, until he is well recovered.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	¶ Of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	The knee is dislocated externally, internally, and towards the lower part, that is, towards the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated towards the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that it makes the limb weaker, that it applies its own knee to its hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all modes of its dislocation is that you make the weak limb sit upright, so that it may extend its knee if possible over that, and your back may adhere to its face: and place its foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make it adhere with your fingers to the knee of that leg, and make them straight over the knee of that leg.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your finger the two sides of the knee of that leg with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another may extend its foot until it returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of returning is that it adheres with the knee to the hip, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply the plaster itself, and make it adhere with the knee to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it together for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And it should not be used for weak walking for a few days until it is cured.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if it refuses your return, then apply a strong extension with the ligaments which I have mentioned in the treatment of the anchylosis, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	¶ Treatment of the Dislocation of the Heel (Calcaneus)
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel is sometimes removed by a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to the complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	The dislocation of this bone either occurs towards the inner part, or towards the outer part.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	The sign of this dislocation is what you see, the heel swollen and proceeding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of this dislocation, however, is an easy reduction: and it is such that it extends with ease with the hands, and becomes equal, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment, however, when it is dislocated according to the complement, it is necessary that you make the weak one sit upright: and hold it with a strong assistant from the posterior part of its back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold it with your right hand leg of it from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of its foot in the place of the knee.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand, and press the chest of the foot with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the chest of the foot towards the third finger of your hand, and you will draw the knee.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If, therefore, it returns to the third finger of your hand, or to two of them, and you see the foot equal, it is good: and if not, then you must repeat the operation on it, because it returns itself.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If, however, it is forbidden to you the reduction of it with that which we have said: then make the weak one lie on its back over its own back on the earth, and fasten a bandage on the firm earth in the way that it falls between the legs of it: and you have already covered it with the bandage over it, so that it does not hurt the weak one.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the assistant takes the other leg of it: then extend the assistant's other foot, either with his own hands, or with a bandage that lies on the neck of its foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the surgeon extends his hand against the extension of the patient's limb: and a thin rod is placed between the two weak legs, holding it, so that it does not attract the body of the patient to the lower part during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the surgeon reduces the dislocation of his hands, and another holds the sound leg to the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For dislocation returns with weakness.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then dislocation returns and the health of his return is declared to you: then place the plaster and ointment, and tightly tie it with the firm ligaments, and tie the foot with the ligament to the sound leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you be careful or fear that the nerves which are above the heel posterior, so that the ligament does not become over them, and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then release it to two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, tie it up again: then untie it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the weak one to walk for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however he dares to walk before that time, it does not ensure safety that the ligament will not be dissolved over the dislocation, and it will become corrupted, and will not receive after that treatment.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If however a hot afterburn occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer to his sedative this, which precedes our narrative of care in another place from our treatment, and ointment, until it is removed.

Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that it be equal to what is dislocated from them with the extension of a few without labor: and this indeed is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some nodules of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that he make sit down the weak leg of his on a place equal to the earth, or on a table: and stand as walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand still and place your foot on that which is being discussed among those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then heat that with your foot using all your strength until it returns to its original state, and you will see that it is already even and does not appear as if it has an eminence.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under your foot the tablet that will take the whole foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it in accordance with the fit that is proper after three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then dissolve it and make it quiet from walking for many days until it is tightened and secured from the reduction.

Caput XXXVI.	Caput XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from that, and you take care of its cure and its restoration, death often follows: and therefore it is not proper to assume the cure of that kind without a very experienced physician who is prudent, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous: and to use in medicines that are settled and hot only: and to let the weak one be judged by divine discernment for a long time.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for health from the salvation of pain with the easing of the disease, and in which something seems to be hoped for.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, let the reduction of that be attempted at once in the beginning of the matter, before the hot aposteme comes.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the member returns as we wish, at that time administer the regimen which soothes the hot aposteme: and cure the knee with it which agrees with him from dried unguents.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If then the dislocation is with a fracture, and they happen in the separated bones of the dead, at that time let us attempt the removal of them, and let us do in that what I have said about simple diseases in those places from which they precede.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	According to your virtue, and to keep you safe from the beginning to the end of your life, and from the fear of death: according to which my prediction precedes.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before God, and more enduring to your glory, and more safe for your body among them in their time.
