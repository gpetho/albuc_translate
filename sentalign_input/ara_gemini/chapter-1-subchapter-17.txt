The seventeenth chapter on cauterizing the fistula that appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treated the fistula with what we mentioned in the classifications of diseases and your treatment was not successful, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
You order the patient to place his head in your lap, and an assistant holds his head between your hands, holding it firmly so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then you place cotton moistened in egg white or in psyllium mucilage on his eyes.
Then you heat the cautery iron, which is of this shape:
It should be hollow, like the quill of an eagle's feather, from the one end which will be cauterized.
And if you wish, it can be perforated at the other end.
And if you wish, it can be solid like a bodkin.
But this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove the pus and dry it.
Or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus.
Then apply the cautery, which is very hot.
Hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand a little during cauterization from the eye towards the nose, lest your hand err or the patient fidget, and the cautery falls into the eyelid and damages it.
If it reaches the bone with the first cauterization,
otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if needed.
And leave it for three days.
Then apply cotton with butter and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals.
If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a strong corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed.
And treat it according to what will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
And another method of cauterizing the fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients,
you aim at the location of the fistula, incise it, then place in the incision a thin funnel, its form is this:
And you pour into it molten lead, the weight of a dirham.
And you hold your hand firmly on the funnel, tightly closed.
And the patient should not move at all, lest the molten lead spill into his eye.
And it is advisable that you place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water.
For the lead cauterizes the fistula's location and heals it wonderfully.
If the fistula is healed by what we have mentioned of cauterization and treatment, then good; otherwise, it is necessary to use perforation of the nose and return the fistula to the nasal passage as will come in its specific place.
