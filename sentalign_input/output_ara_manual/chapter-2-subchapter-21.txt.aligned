On incising the uvea.	On cutting for staphyloma.	0.40864837
If a hernia occurs in the uveal layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, thus disfiguring the person, and you want to remove it, the procedure is as I describe.	When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe.	0.8118067
That is, you insert a needle into the base of the growth from below to above. Then you insert another needle threaded with a double thread from the side of the canthus, and pass it through.  Leave the first needle as it is.	You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place.	0.8253794
Then you cut the doubled thread at the loop and tie some of the growth around the needle and tighten it gently. Then remove the needle and apply wool moistened with egg white to the eye, and leave it until the threads fall off with the growth.  Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.	Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well. Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth. Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed. Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased.	0.86571485
Until the wound heals. You can also tie the growth from all sides with a circle of cloth, so that the eye swells up gently, then lance it with a thin scalpel reaching to the depths of the eye, so the aqueous humor flows and the eye shrinks and withers on the spot, then bandage it until it heals.	Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed. Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased. Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once. Then bandage till healed.	0.7832532
