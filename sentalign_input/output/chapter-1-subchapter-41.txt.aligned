of the hip pain When pain comes to the hip joint, caused by cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment does not work, and the disease is old: then you must purge the patient of the thick humors with fetid pills or other good pills.	When pain occurs in the hip joint and is due to cold and humidities, and the patient has been treated by those means mentioned in the section, and the treatment is ineffectual, and the pain becomes chronic, the patient should be purged of the heavy humours with foetid pills or pills of tamarind or the like; then cauterize him.	0.80784434
Afterward make the cautery; and the manner of the cautery is according to two ways: with burning medicines, and fire cautery. Fire cautery is done in many ways, one of which is: cauterize on the hip joint with three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make them deep and large, with a space between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cautery be olive-shaped; sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, so there are four according to this shape:	The means of cauterization in this case is twofold: either with caustic chemicals or with fire. The actual cautery will serve for several methods. One of them is to make three cauterizations over the femoral joint itself in a triangular manner ; and let them be of a fair depth; and the space between them a finger's breadth. The cautery should be an olivary one.	0.75614345
And if you wish, cauterize with the circular cautery mentioned earlier for the dislocation of the hip; but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and the entire thickness of the core is burned.	The burning may be done with the circular cautery which has been mentioned under cauterization of a dislocated hip; a single cauterization so that the circle embrace the whole joint. Burn through the whole thickness of the skin.	0.72870487
And this is the manner done for sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or leg. If it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers wide, a little to the left; and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and burn the thickness of the core; and if the patient feels the pain extends to the toes or near there, cauterize where the pain is felt with three or four pricks with the cautery called "poins".	This is the form of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip joint and does not extend to the femur and the leg. But if it extends to the femur and the leg, cauterize him over the thigh with two burns at the place where the patient indicates the pain to be; and one burn four fingers above the great tendon of the heel, a little to the outer side.	0.83317137
And if necessary, make more; if the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with the knife-shaped or circular cautery, and be very careful with all your cauteries not to leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, causing the patient greater harm and contraction.	If he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the shank, give him one burn there with the edged cautery. Be careful in all your cauterizing not to carry the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery; for thence arises grave harm, or crippling, to the patient.	0.7876686
And I myself have seen many who made cautery on the ankle of the foot and left it so long that the leg was entirely swollen, and the foot too, and the foot was pierced and corrupted. Afterward a bowel disorder from which he died.	I myself have seen more than one person cauterizing over the tendon of Achilles, the cauterization being excessive, and the leg was affected with a defluxion of humours which eventually reached the foot and the whole was riddled; after that came diarrhoea, and, after that, death.	0.7959193
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery on each, in this manner. The wise said for the hip cautery, whose manner is this: make such an iron tool and let it be at the head as thick as a date stone, or a little less, and let it be interlaced, with a space between each interlace the size of a knuckle; and let the interlaces be open on two sides, and be like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle; and this is the shape:	If there is pain in two places, cauterize both in this way. Certain learned doctors have mentioned a cauterization applicable to the hip in this manner: make a bowl of iron with a diameter of half a span; the thickness of the edge of its mouth should be that of a date-stone or a little less. Another bowl is introduced into this, and a third into that; and there is a distance between the bowls of a thumb-joint. The bowls are open on both sides; and the depth of them should be a thumb-joint or two.	0.7993604
And heat it until it is all red and sparks, then place it on the diseased hip joint, and turn it on the healthy side; and cauterize once with a round cautery and leave it for three days; then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; afterward treat with ointment until healed.	Then heat this cautery in the fire until it is hot and sends out sparks; and so let it be applied to the hip, the patient lying on his sound side; and thus three circular cauterizations will be produced at a time. Afterwards let it be for three days; then smear with butter and leave the wound open for a while; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.8873588
Albucasim said that we use little of this cautery due to the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it; however, it is a good cautery, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.	The author of this book says that we very rarely employ this method of cauterization on account of the ugliness and dread appearance of it, and because we find few patients who will endure it. Nevertheless, it is one of the best cauteries for him who can endure it and is correctly treated by it.	0.68246317
