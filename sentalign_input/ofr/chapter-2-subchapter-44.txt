of the thick neck/throat
This abscess is called "throat hernia", and is a large abscess the color of soot, and is very common in women; and it is of two kinds: natural, and accidental; there is no trick to the natural one.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one is similar to a fatty knot, and the other kind is similar to an abscess that comes from a knot of an artery; and there is danger, and one should not operate with iron except in the one that is small, and test and examine it with a probe: if you find it like a fatty knot, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it, as one cuts knots, and pull it out with its entire covering, if there is any; and examine everything carefully, and treat it as appropriate, until it is completely healed.
