of the cough
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the chest in empty places; and one cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cautery be called "clavile" according to the shape mentioned earlier.
And if you want, make a cautery by pricking with the cautery called "poins" whose shape is mentioned earlier in the disease of the ears; and make up to thirty pricks, or around that number. Afterward treat the area as mentioned earlier, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this shape:
And for this reason, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at once.
