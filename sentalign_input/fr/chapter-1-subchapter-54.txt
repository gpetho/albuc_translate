The treatment of trembling
When someone trembles from the coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or another, it is necessary to make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the foot, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery; this will stop the trembling, and hasten the recovery from the cold disease.
