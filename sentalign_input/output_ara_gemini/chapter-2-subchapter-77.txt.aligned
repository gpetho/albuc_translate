This binder, which is used to straighten books, similarly has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binder, and should be made of either ebony or boxwood.	This is the type of instrument with which books are pressed. It has two screws at either end of two pieces of wood; but this instrument should be more slender than a book press, and should be made of ebony or boxwood.	0.8851616
And the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers, and their edge about a finger, and their length a span and a half. And in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two projections of the same type of wood that have been fastened in them, their length being half a span or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more.	The width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers' breadth and the thickness about one, and the length a span and a half; and in the middle of both pieces of wood, firmly attached, should be two projections made of the same kind of wood, each half a span long or a little more, and two fingers wide or a little more.	0.93345284
And these two projections are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the two screws; a picture of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter:	It is these two projections that are to be introduced into the vagina so that it is thereby opened when you turn the screws. Another instrument, for the same purpose, but smaller and lighter.	0.7980455
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two projections at its end, as you see. The length of each projection is about a span, and their width is two fingers.	It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of forceps, but at the end it has two projections as you can see; and the length of each is about a span and the breadth two fingers.	0.9486482
If you want to open the cervix with it, sit the woman on a bed with her legs dangling and spread apart. Then insert these two projections folded together into the opening of the cervix while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, equally according to how much you want to open the cervix, until the midwife does what she wants.	When you wish to open the womb with this, make the woman sit on a couch with her legs hanging down, parted; then introduce the two projections pressed together into the orifice of the womb while you hold the end of the instrument lower down between her thighs; then open your hand in the same way as you would do with forceps, to the extent to which you wish to open the womb, so as to allow the midwife to do what she desires.	0.94737995

It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see.	It resembles scissors with toothed jaws, as you see.	0.82064366
And it may be made rectangular like hooks in this form as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, you cut and file with it.	Sometimes it is made long like forceps, as you see in this illustration, with teeth like the teeth of a saw; and you may either cut or crush with it.	0.6849579
Picture of a cannon also:	Figure of another thruster.	0.48419905
Picture of a fishing hook:	Figure of a hook.	0.5960706
This hook should have some thickness so that it does not break when the fetus is pulled with it.	This is a hook which should be rather thick so as not to break when extracting the foetus.	0.8376976

Picture of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus:	Figure of two broad scalpels for cutting up the foetus.	0.86358047
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his status among people.	The more types of these instruments the practitioner has ready by him, the more rapidly he operates, and the greater his reputation among men.	0.8341519
So do not disdain to have any instrument prepared. For there will inevitably be a need for it.	So do not neglect to have ready by you a single one of these instruments, for you will certainly need it.	0.82923496
