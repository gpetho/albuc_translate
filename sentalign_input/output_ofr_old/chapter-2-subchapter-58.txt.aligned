of the retention of the urine	On the treatment of retention of urine.	0.6081551
The retention of urine is caused by the obstruction of a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or flesh growth, or similar things that we have mentioned in the division;	Retention of the urine is caused by an obstruction, from a stone or a clot of blood or pus or a fleshy tumour, or similar cause.	0.7903603
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should bend over his knees; and place his feet on his back, and stretch his belly over his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone, thus releasing the urine;	When you have carried out treatment in the ways we have prescribed in their place and the urine is not released; and when you see that it is held back by a stone sticking in the neck of the bladder, then you should have the patient down on his knees, squatting; then mount a man on his back to press his abdomen against his back; and let the patient himself hold his breath as tightly as possible; for then pressure will be put on the neck of the bladder to force the stone back and liberate the urine.	0.8541633
and if it does not come out as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," which has this form: it is made of fine silver, light, and shaped like a bird's feather; and the tube is a palm and a half in length, and fine at the tip.	But if these measures do not free it and the matter is very urgent with the patient, then you should attempt to bring it out with the instrument called a catheter, of which this is the figure. It is made of silver, slender and smooth and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather; as slender as a probe; about a span and a half in length; and with a tiny funnel at the end.	0.76034737
The method of releasing the urine is to take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton at the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe; and cut the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then coat the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a chair, and moisten his bladder and penis with olive oil and warm water;	This is the manner in which you draw off the urine through it: take a double thread and with a strong knot tie a little wool or cotton on the end, introduce the end of the thread into the lower end of the catheter, and trim off with scissors any superfluous wool, so that it will go into the tube and close it like a tassel. Then smear the catheter with oil or butter or egg-white. Make the patient sit down; then anoint the bladder and the meatus of the penis with humid oils or with olive-oil and warm water.	0.8462592
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the base of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the abdomen; then push the syringe forward until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reach the empty space, and this is done in this order only because the passage where it goes is twisted; then gradually pull out the thread with the wool, and the urine follows the wool, then remove it, and let the urine flow;	Then gently introduce the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra. Then turn the end of the penis upward toward the umbilicus; then push the catheter inwards until the curve of the catheter ends, and push the catheter in until it reaches nearly to the seat. Then turn the penis down, with the catheter in it, and push until it reaches the bladder, and the patient now feels that it has entered a hollow. The reason why the operation is done in this manner is that the passage by which the urine is excreted is curved.	0.8679694
and repeat the syringe process until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.	Apply the catheter again and again until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.	0.7506619
