On the excision of swelling and protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Chapter 71.
Swelling sometimes enlarges beyond the natural state, becoming disfigured and unsightly; in some women, it may grow to the extent that it expands like a male organ and becomes capable of sexual intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold the excessive swelling with your hand or with a hook and cut it away; however, do not go too deep with the incision, especially at the base, to avoid bleeding.
Then treat the area with regular wound care until it heals.
Overgrown flesh may grow within the opening of the uterus until it fills the space; it may even protrude outward in a tail-like manner. Because of this, some early scholars called this ailment "caudate illness."
Thus, we should excise it as we do for swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
