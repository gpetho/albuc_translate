On the method of cauterizing for dropsy.
Chapter 33.
Cautery is only applied in cases of ascitic dropsy specifically.
When treating a dropsical patient with the previously described treatments and they prove ineffective, you should then cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another over the liver, one on the spleen, two on the back between the vertebrae, one opposite the chest, and another opposite the stomach. The depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery site open so it may discharge pus over a long period.
And do not abandon treatment for the patient after the cautery; it is necessary to combine two aims, and healing will hasten with Godâ€™s help.
The shape of the cautery used for the abdomen should be nail-like, as previously described, and the one used for the back should be olive-shaped, as previously specified.
