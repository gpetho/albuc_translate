 CHAPTER FIVE.
On cauterization of pain in the ears.
When the ear gets a pain from the cold and is treated with laxatives and other medicine as mentioned in its section and the pain nevertheless persists, heat the cautery termed 'punctate'.
Then after it has been heated prick with it in a circle right round the ear, or around both if there is pain in both, after the place has been marked with ink; the cauterizations being a little away from the ear.
Let the cauterization be of ten punctures or thereabouts round each.
Then dress the places till healed.
