Restoration of a chest fracture.	On the repair of a fracture of the breast.	0.7990261
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and this often happens; but its edges are very often crushed and fragmented.	The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle but this happens rarely; more often it is the extremities of it that are broken and comminuted.	0.93868744
And one of the accidents of a middle fracture is that it leans inward, causing great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and often spitting blood; this is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.	The symptoms that occur when it is broken in the middle are that he bows downwards and suffers violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and sometimes he vomits blood; and there is an obvious and palpable concavity in the bone.	0.79259205
The restoration involves having the patient lie on their back and placing a cushion between their shoulders; then press the muscles, adjust the ribs with hands on both sides, and work gently in the operation and alignment in every possible way until the bone's shape is restored.	Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.	0.8776027
Then place a plaster and wool on it, followed by a thin wooden splint made of willow or similar light wood, wrapped in cloth; gently bandage it over the broken bone so it does not move; wrap it round the back several times, and tighten it decently; check the bandage regularly and tighten it when it loosens.	Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.	0.94268644
If a need arises to remove the bandage due to erosion, itching, pain, or abscess, quickly remove it, clean the plaster, rectify the situation with appropriate treatment, and then replace the plaster and tighten it until it heals.	If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment. Then renew the plaster if you think fit, and keep it bandaged until it heals.	0.8505868
