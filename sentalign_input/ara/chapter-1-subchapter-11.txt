Chapter Eleven.
On Cauterizing for Melancholy.
If the cause of melancholy is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauterizations that we mentioned for the one who suffers from hemiplegia.
If the cause of melancholy is an excess inclining toward black bile, and the patient's body is moist, then make him drink what purifies his brain, as preceded in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a well-fitted cake of linen, like a circle, then lower it to the middle of his head, with the patient sitting cross-legged, holding it from each side; then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it over the fire with a moderate heat, as much as the finger can bear when inserted into it, then empty it onto the middle of his head, within the circle, and leave it until it cools.  Do this to the patient once every week, along with all of his other good regimens, until he recovers, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, dotted burns without holding your hand on the cautery, rather, it should be a quick touch.  For this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply to it cotton soaked in tallow or chicken fat.
