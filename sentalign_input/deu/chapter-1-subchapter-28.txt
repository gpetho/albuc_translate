Chapter Twenty-Eight:
On the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When an abscess forms in the liver and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient feels heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the covering of the liver, the pain is sharp and sometimes the doctors are already exhausted by treating it.
So the patient should be turned onto their back; then mark the place of the abscess with ink; and then heat the cautery which is shaped like a needle, the form of which was described on the previous page.
And cauterize with that cautery until the entire tendon is burned, until it reaches the covering, so that pus may escape.
And then treat it as with other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not suitable to use this form of cautery except by someone whose study in the art of medicine is advanced and who has treated many illnesses; this operation should only be attempted by experienced practitioners, but it is best to leave it to us.
