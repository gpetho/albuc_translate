Chapter eighteen on dripping eye drops into the eye.	CHAPTER EIGHTEEN. On gathering up pannus from the eye.	0.7133117
Cobwebs are red veins that are woven over the eye, preventing it from performing its function of sight.	Pannus is a network of blood-vessels spreading over the eye so as to interfere with the function of sight and, in the course of time, weakening the eye.	0.51757693
And the eye weakens with the length of days, so it is necessary for you first to look; if the eye in which the cobwebs are is strong and there is no other disease in it other than the cobwebs, then the plucking is that you order the ill person to place his head in your lap, then hang those veins with one hook or two depending on your skill, and the hooks should be smooth in bending according to this picture:	You must first examine, and if the eye with the pannus be strong, with no fault other than the pannus, then the pannus should be gathered up. This is done by bidding the patient put his head in your lap; then, as skilfully as you may, pick up those blood-vessels with one or two hooks. The hooks should be of a gentle curve, like this.	0.7788905
Or it may be two double hooks in one body, in this form:	Or there can be two hooks joined together on one handle, thus.	0.7000667
Then you gently pick up those veins with fine scissors and gently wipe away the blood from time to time until you see that those veins have disappeared from the eye and the blood has been drained.	Then take up the blood-vessels gently with the fine scissors, and wipe away the blood constantly, till you see all those blood-vessels removed from the eye, and the blood wells forth.	0.8934819
And be careful with the eye, do not hurt it with the tips of the scissors.	But be careful of the eye lest you damage it with the points of the scissors.	0.7993697
And let your work be at midday, facing the sun. And be very steady in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those veins.	Let your work be done in broad sunlight at midday; and be very steady in your action so as to cut nothing beside the bloodvessels.	0.8757316
When you are finished, instill in the eye the green or red suppository so that its sharpness consumes what remains of the diseased tissue.	When you have finished, instil the red or green lotion into the eye to destroy by its caustic action the remnants of the pannus.	0.80547
If you cannot pick it all up at that time, then dress the eye with something that soothes the eye's pain and leave it for days until its pain subsides and you are safe from the hot swelling.	If you are unable to gather it all up at that one time, apply a plaster to the eye such as will allay the pain, and leave him* for a few days till* the pain be eased and there is no danger of an abscess.	0.7903755
Then repeat the procedure on it in this same manner until it heals.	Then repeat the operation in the same manner till it is healed.	0.92707014
This is a picture of the scissors:	This is a figure of the scissors. [	0.66117156
The basis of the procedure is that you open the eye with fixed or triangular openers, held by a skilled student, and the head of the patient is in the lap of the student, and another one dries the tears and verifies the gaze in the front of the eye and its back, and you have the choice to start the picking from the top of the eye or from its bottom.	The principle in the operation is that the eye be opened with double or triple openers held by a skilful pupil, the patient's head being in that pupil's lap, while another wipes away the tears and carefully watches the internal and external angles of the eye. You have the choice between beginning the removal from the top or from the bottom of the eye.	0.8660262
And it's best to dry two hooks on the upper side, one at the end of the corona and the other at its beginning, and hold them between the middle and index fingers.	The best method is to fix two hooks in the upper side, one at the end of the iris and the other at the beginning of it.	0.7103636
Then hold them between the little finger and the ring finger.	Hold them between your middle and first fingers.	0.7437498
And lift your hand lightly until you see that all the strands have risen.	Raise your hand slightly until you see that the whole pannus has been lifted.	0.76875085
Cut from the smaller west, if you wish, with scissors, and if you wish, with a fine scalpel.	Then cut from the lesser angle, with scissors or a fine scalpel, as you wish.	0.74353355
And insert the probe on a needle and clean all the strands until they rise over the conjunctiva.	Introduce the scraping-needle and cut away the entire pannus until it is lifted over the conjunctiva.	0.74070257
And do not cut the dryness, because tears and blood will become difficult (liquify?) for you.	Do not interrupt the wiping, for tears and blood will flow and hinder you.	0.5648998
Then cut with scissors what is beyond the corona, from above and from below, so that nothing remains attached except in the cornea.	Then cut with scissors what is left over the iris, from above and below, until nothing remains adhering except over the cornea.	0.9110411
If you can lift it from the cornea by peeling with the probe, it is better.	If you can remove it from over the cornea, peel with the scraping-needle, for it is better, and in some cases is easily done.	0.658826
