Chapter twelve on lifting the irritating hair from the eye with a needle.
If it is a hair or two, the procedure for that is to take a thin needle and insert in it a smooth, thin silk thread.
Then bring its two ends together and tie them in a very gentle knot.
And let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach to the loop another thin thread, shorter than it.
And tie its ends if you wish.
Then have the patient place his head in your lap and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is delicate work.
Then insert the needle with the loop at the base of the extra hair and pass it quickly through the eyelid until you bring it out from above the natural hair.
Then pull the thread over the loop and insert that hair into the loop, whether it is one or two or three, no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid along with the natural hair.
If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop down with the thread you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper hole.
Then put the hair back in it and pull them both.
Do this until it rises in the upper hole and you see it with your own eyes.
Then release the loop and the thread and remove them.
And tighten the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and the flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either add to it a long hair from the natural hair, so it will rise with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, then you can remove it.
