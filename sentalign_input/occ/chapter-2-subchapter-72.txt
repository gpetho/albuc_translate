Chapter 72.
On the treatment of imperforate hymen.
Alratica is when the vulva of the woman is not perforated or the opening is very small.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and it is caused either by flesh grown together or by a thin or thick membrane.
And it happens either at the base of the vagina, or on its sides, or at its top, or at its bottom, and it prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and often stops menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by the observation of the midwife if the blockage is apparent and near; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with a rod.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and it is near the two labia, then you cut it and break it.
And it is that you place on the two labia some powder, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then extend the two labia with force until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the spot, and lie with a man that day so that the cut place does not heal.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you need to cut it with a broad spatula or a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to grown flesh, then lift it with a hook, and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop the flow of blood without stinging, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then administer a broad lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly.
And keep it for some days and administer dry calk.
Then treat it with other wound care until it is healed.
And sometimes there is a birth of other flesh in the vagina, and then you need to cut it in this manner.
But if this is due to a cancerous abscess, no treatment with iron should be done to the cancerous abscess in the vagina in any way.
