Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed for you, O sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end in it, from its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is the part of operating, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because surgery by hand has declined in our region, and in our time has been completely neglected, until perhaps its knowledge has perished and its trace has been erased, and nothing has remained of it except short descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered, and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its purposes have been obscured, and its force diminished: It has seemed to me that I should revive it with the organization of this treatise on it according to the method of exposition and explanation and brevity, and that I should come with the forms of the cautery irons and the other instruments of the work, since it is made with additional explanation and with the speed that is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason, however, why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the structures of the limbs and their forms and their joining and separation, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number and their origin, and of the pulsating and quiet veins and the places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that Hippocrates said that reputation is great in name, but little in practice, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about that in the introduction of this book. 
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since he who does not know what we have said about anatomy is not exempt from falling into error, by which men are killed, just as I have seen many of those who are instructed in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	Which is because I saw a foolish doctor cut a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and he cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another doctor, who presumed to extract a stone from a man, who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician, who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land on account of medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, that there was a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with a tight binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he absolved him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he left him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and he remained thus until his leg and his foot festered, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the infection was already established in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the infection ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished. 
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated after some days, until its malignancy increased with its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	Which is, because when a cancer is purely from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with a knife at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it, so that all of it may be cut away.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that operating with the hand is divided into two categories: namely, an operation which is associated with healing: and an operation, with which there is danger in many situations. 
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already indicated in every place of this book, in which an operation occurs, where there is dread and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of it, and leave it alone: lest fools find a way to speak, and to dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take your measurements with care and protection, and [treat] your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by the grace of God to health and praiseworthy success: and leave aside terrible diseases of difficult healing: and remove your minds from that which makes you fear, lest hesitation enter upon you in your faith and your advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more enduring for your glory, and loftier in this world, and ultimately for your status.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cautery with fire, and cautery with a sharp medicine, divided into chapters, and arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of the instruments, and the irons of the cautery: and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On cutting and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping glasses, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things similar to that: and all divided into chapters, arranged with the forms of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and things similar to that: divided into chapters, arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of the instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the Benefit, and Harm of the Cautery: and for which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But indeed before I discuss the operation with it, it is necessary that I describe the quality of its benefits and its harms: and in which complexion it may be exhibited.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say, therefore, that the discussion concerning the quality of the benefit and the harm of the cautery, is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a science, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also, a multitude of wise men have spoken on it, and they have disagreed on it: and for me indeed a little of their discussions suffices, fearing lengthiness. 
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say, therefore, that cautery is universally beneficial to every complexion, which is with matter and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter and the dry complexion without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, they have disagreed concerning the hot and dry complexion with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others have said the opposite of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in a disease, which is from heat and dryness: since the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that something be healed from a hot and dry disease, with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of that said: that by cautery benefit is made in every hot and dry disease, which occurs in human bodies: since when you compare the human body, and its humidities, to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say, according to his discourse, that experience has already revealed that to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Nevertheless, it is not appropriate that anyone approach it, except he who has already been proven, and practiced in the last exercise of the chapter on cautery, and has learned the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their incidental symptoms, and the length of their duration. 
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the remaining complexions, however, there is no fear for you: and especially in cold and humid diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all physicians have agreed upon them: and they have not disagreed on the benefit of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, sons, that among the secrets of treatment by cautery with fire, and its advantage over cautery with a burning medicine, is this: that fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the part that is cauterized: and it does not harm another part connected to it, except with slight harm. 
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of a burning medicine, however, reaches those parts that are distant from the limb: and perhaps it causes a disease to occur in the limb that is difficult to heal, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance, does not do that, unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now truly that has become known to us through experience, because of long service and study with the art, and attention to the truth of things: and for that reason I am excused for the length of the discourse. 
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not because it is not permitted in this book of mine, I would bring to you a hidden secret concerning fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies by its expulsion, by which it expels diseases, in demonstrative philosophical language, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, my sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is suitable to perform cautery, and they propose spring as the best time.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is suitable in every season: because the harm occurring due to the season is submerged in the benefit that is obtained with cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay: because it is feared from them that an evil may occur which is greater than the small harm entering because of the season.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it enter your minds, oh sons, that which only the common people and foolish doctors believe, namely that the illness which is healed by cautery never returns: and they consider this a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a substitute for medicine, which alters the complexion, and dries the humors which are the causes why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its effectiveness, and the power of its operation, and the intensity of its control: and it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and what happens to him in his acquisition from foods, and similar causes, unless it is an illness in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a limb of few superfluities and humors, such as cauterizing a tooth because of pain, and things similar to it, it is possible that that pain may not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But indeed the common saying again, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a correct saying: not according to what they intend by it: since they believe that there is no treatment that compares with medicine, nor with anything else after the use of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, only because when we administer methods of treatment in any illnesses, and those medicines are ineffective, then finally we administer cautery, and it is effective: then it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients, however, said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say that except because of the evenness of gold and the refinement of its substance: and they said that the place of cautery does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true: because I have already tested that, and I found that it does not do that in some bodies but not in others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you heat a cautery made of gold in a fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the extent that you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it quickly cools, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the practitioner falls into difficulty because of that: and because of that, cautery with iron is faster for us and more convenient, because of its suitability for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed arranged this chapter on cautery according to the chapters: and I have arranged them from the head to the feet: so that it may be easy for the one seeking what he wants from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter 2
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Cautery here helps against the dominance of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are the causes of lethargy, and an abundance of flow of humors from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, and toothache, and throat pain: and generally every illness which occurs from coldness, such as paralysis, and lethargy, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cautery is that you first instruct the patient to be purged with a dissolving medicine cleansing the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the patient, and his age, and his constitution demands.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit squarely between your hands, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat an olive-shaped cautery: whose form is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the spot marked with ink, lowering it, by which your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	But if you see now exposed from the bone the amount of the head of a probe, or the amount of a zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat with your hand using the same iron, or with another one if it gets cold: until the bones, which I told you about, are visible.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak cotton in it, and put it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then put on it cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the scar of the burn is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that the more a wound remains open, it emits pus: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held until some of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then after that which has been burned from the bone is scraped, then it should be treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary that with the cautery one should reach the furthest point, until it makes a strong impression in the bone, so that the bone which is shaped like a hazelnut falls out: or the instrument which women place infused with a little alphabet: and they believe that vapors of the head are breathed out from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it heals.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	But to me, these two types of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain people by way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it alone, in my opinion, is better for the patient's health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other limbs: and especially when the head of the patient is naturally weak: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore operate with it in safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the entire head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the entire head: and it is prolonged in the patient, and he uses clysters, and decoctions, and purges for the head, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of these things benefit him: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the patient is of a strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and he experiences intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below that one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize him upon each horn of his head with a cautery, but do not let it penetrate the skin, and uncover from the bone the amount, which we have described. 
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one cautery on the occiput of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where the cupping glass is placed: and raise your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the patient experiences because of that intense pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will speak of this cautery in its place: and it is necessary that the cautery, with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput, be finer than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in migraine, both with a caustic medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and throbbing occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the other treatment, which I spoke of in the sections on diseases, is administered, and all of this is ineffective: then cauterization on it is according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	Cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, however, is as follows: you should take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut open the painful area with a wide lancet, until a place under the skin is made in which the clove fits. 
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it in that place under the skin, until it is hidden: then press upon it with a compress with a suitable tightness, and leave it for fifteen hours.  Then remove it, and take out the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter on it, until the area forms pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals. 
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do this with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron, however, is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Heat a cautery, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called nail-shaped: because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in its middle there is a certain small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand steady: and you turn the iron slowly with speed: and let the amount that is burned of the thickness of the skin be like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak cotton in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then apply cotton with butter: afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the second cautery knife blade.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this migraine, not a true ancient one.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	¶ On the method of cauterizing an ancient migraine.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you treat a migraine, with what we have said about the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment is not effective: and you see from the illness that what we have said is not sufficient for it, with the first cautery with medicine, or with the cautery with fire, then it is necessary that you heat the bladed cautery until it becomes white, after you mark the painful area with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and put down your hand once, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of touching the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest the side be burned, or the nerve that moves it, whence spasm may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery, which has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting there is danger, especially for him who is ignorant of what he is doing, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he abandons the operation with it at the beginning.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a discussion of the treatment of the flow of blood occurring from the artery according to its method, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	But if you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the cautery, which we described in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain in the ear arises from cold, and it is treated with laxatives and other treatments that we have discussed in the section, and the pain is not removed, then burn with a cautery: and it is that which is called "the Point," whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then prick with it after its ignition around the circumference of the whole ear, as it revolves: or around the circumference of both, if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And keep the cautery a little away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the number of cauterizations be ten points in each ear, or approximately that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the areas until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing in torticollis.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torticollis, which is treated with cauterization, is only one of the types that arises from phlegm, as we have stated in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness, and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torticollis with medicines, and head purges, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower than its temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery opposite the affected part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Since softening does not occur, except in the part that appears healthy. 
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the manner of cauterization is, that you cauterize it with a cautery directly on the upper tip of the ear below the corner of the head a little: and another on the temple: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And remove your hand with the cautery, as soon as an amount half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, whose form was presented earlier: however, it is not much thinner than it, as you see: and it is necessary that the blade on it be a little extra thick.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the locations with what was described before, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each corner of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what has been said before: and the manner of cauterization should be according to what has been said before.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	He is also cauterized with a cautery above the mouth of the stomach: and this is the most extreme measure.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then he should be treated with what has been described before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in cases of forgetfulness.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that at first the patient be given in a drink large doses of hiera and pills that cleanse the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the patient's entire head, and place on the back of his head the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is the method of cautery: and do it according to the same order, which I described there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by this, good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and leave between each cautery the width of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cautery with what has been described before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you want to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	And if you want to add more, then cauterize him on the two temples.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed, and the cautery should be olive-shaped according to the form previously described.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	On the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter 10
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	You should proceed to cleanse the head with hiera and with what we have mentioned.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the patient's head: afterwards cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on the back of it, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck. 
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	But if you need, in the illness with softening of the body, more than these, and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, the last one with the cautery until much of his skin is burned, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat him until he is healed: and thus the Olivary cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized, unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	It is necessary, therefore, that you first cleanse his brain with hiera, and with the other treatments that we have described in the division: when the patient is an adult, or tolerant in receiving medications.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a child, who does not tolerate medications, then a gargle is administered, and mastications cleansing the brain, before that for many days with improved foods. 
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to the preceding method: and with another cautery on his occiput, and on each horn of his head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if the patient is strong, and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries, which I spoke of in the one having paralysis, and softening of the body upon the vertebrae of the neck, and vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cautery, according to this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors, and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries, which we have mentioned in the one having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess declining to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something which cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a neatly made compress of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting upright should be held on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And the more suitable is made from old sheep butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with moderate heat, as much as the finger can tolerate when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then pour it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the patient once a week, with his other good regimen, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize him by making very small punctures, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: rather let it be by smelling.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place over it cotton soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in water descending to the eye.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of the water in the eye is revealed to you through the signs, which I spoke of in the division, then begin and have the patient drink that which cleanses his head. 
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him from all moistures, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him upon both temples with two cauteries, if there is a beginning of a descent of water in both eyes at the same time: or on one side, if there is a beginning of water in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterizations on it be long in the width of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	But if you see any of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and caution against the flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes he is cauterized on the neck, below the two bones, with two cauteries produced last.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for chronic Lachrymal conditions.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are chronic, constant, and are above the veins and arteries that are on the outside of the head, it is confirmed that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I described in the beginning of the falling water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. 
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need to do more, then cauterize him on each side, cautiously near the eye, on the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for a foul odor of the Nose.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we have said in the section, and the treatment is not effective: then hurry, and give the patient scammony to drink for three nights: then shave their head and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize him with a nail-shaped cautery, two burns, above both eyebrows slightly under the hair.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterizing for softening of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this crescent-shaped cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on each side: and let them be extended from the two temples: and let the length of each cautery be according to the lengths of the eyebrow: and do not extend your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of the crescent-shaped cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn inward, pricking the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	Cauterization in this case is by two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cauterization with fire, however, order the patient, before doing it, to let his eyelashes grow, if he is among those who trim them, until they lengthen and become even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move, until they grow out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they grow out and become even, then place the patient's head in your lap: then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with ink, a mark that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the eyelashes.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place cotton soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure, which you marked little by little in many passes, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is burned, all of it appearing distinctly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is this: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the eyelashes rising up at the corner of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore, lift your hand then, and leave it alone for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place upon it lint with butter until the scar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if any of the hairs return after a time, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If, however, the hairs are on the lower eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is leveled so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	¶ On the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	You are to instruct the patient to leave the hairs alone until they lengthen and become even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make from cloth paper a shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, of each one ounce in weight, or about that: then grind them together thoroughly, and do this quickly, so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then spread some of it on the paper that you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white: and the patient's head should be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it lightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the patient feels the biting of the medicine: because its bite feels like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	Therefore, while this biting sensation continues, then release the medicine, and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When, therefore, the biting subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then observe, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised in contraction with fire, or with an incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat with the medicine over the area, on which the medicine does not leave an impression, and does not blacken, until your work is uniform, and the eye is contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put cotton with butter on it, until the burned skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation, that you take the greatest care, lest any of the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	But if the eyelid softens after some days, and some of the hairs irritate the eye, then repeat the medicine over that place, which softens from the eyelid itself, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And you should know that the eyes of men differ in size, both large and small.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, let your consideration be according to that: and the path of correctness is not hidden from him who has zeal for this art. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	On the method of cauterizing a lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, with what we have said in the sections on diseases, and your treatment is ineffective, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and let an assistant hold his head between his hands in such a way that he does not move it, nor does he shake his head. 
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place cotton soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye: then heat a cautery, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cauterization is done: and if you wish, let it be penetrating up to the other end, and if you wish, let it be upwards like a tent.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave one is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then squeeze the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place upon it the cautery, which should be made very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with it for a short time near the cautery away from the eye, towards the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the patient become restless: and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If, therefore, you arrive at the beginning of your cauterization right to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization once, or twice, if you need to: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply cotton with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	But if forty days pass and it is not healed: then apply a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed: and scrape it as described in its chapter. 
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some of the early ones mentioned.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Focus on the location of the fistula, and cut it open: then insert into that fissure a thin camahan, that is, a thin cannula, the shape of which is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a drachm's weight of molten lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly in place, and the patient should not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And you should place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For the lead burns the site of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	And if the fistula is healed, with what we have described of cautery and treatment, that is good. 
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to treat the nostril opening, and return the fistula to the course of the nose, according as it will come to its own proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	¶ On the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Often fissures occur on the lip, which are called hairs, and especially on the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When, therefore, you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the section on diseases, and the treatment is not effective, then cauterize with a small knife-shaped cautery, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place it, heated, quickly into the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depths of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a carrot until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it forms pus, and ruptures: afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and the treatment is ineffective, then it is necessary that you heat a cautery according to the size which the fistula can accommodate.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth, and its end: do this once, or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it after that, with what we have said about treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the discharge of pus ceases, and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its own chapter.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	On the method of cauterizing in the gums, and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then heat the cautery, the form of which will come after this, so that you place the cannula over the tooth: and insert the heated cautery into it quickly: and hold your hand for a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire now reaching the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand: then repeat the cautery a few times, according to your desire.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the loose tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	On the method of cauterizing in toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold in it, or a worm, and treatment with medicines is not effective: then cautery is used on it in two ways: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	Cautery with butter is done by taking cow's butter and boiling it in an iron spoon or in a bronze vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe. 
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in the boiling butter and place it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it there until it cools; then repeat this several times until the power of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge wool, or cotton, in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; and place a hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depths of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Cauterization with fire, however, is done by applying a bronze tube, or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be some thickness to its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then heat the cautery, whose form will be shown, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand there until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary when applying that cautery, that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour, then spit it out. 
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever end you wish, according to what is possible, and this is the shape of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	On the method of cauterizing scrofulous tumors.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When scrofulous tumors are from phlegm, and from cold humors, and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly, then heat a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that the smoke may come out by the cautery from one end: and place the heated cautery upon the abscess once, and a second time, if you need it, until it reaches the depths of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	But if the abscess is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it cotton soaked in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment, until it heals in the shape of a tube.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice, and constriction of breath.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When humors prevail over the windpipe of the lung, and especially when that is with a coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated first with loosening medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize him on the nape of the neck at the base of the throat in a depressed place: and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor into the skin, except a little of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize him with another cautery at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra: and let the cautery be key-shaped according to the method which preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in diseases of the lung, and coughs.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When a cough and disease of the lung are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the pit of the throat in places depressed, smooth, and empty.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a cannula according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncturing with the cautery, which is called "Punctum," whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to almost as many again. 
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what has been described previously, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, cauterization is facilitated with it, when you make three cauteries with it at one time.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	On the method of cauterizing in shaking palsy, in dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated because of moistures, and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is laid on his back or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin, which is on the inside of the shaking palsy upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then heat a cautery having two tips with fire.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will come with four burns.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three tips, therefore the shape of the cauterization is then of six burns: and the tips are according to the thinness of a probe.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of a cautery having three tips.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this method, therefore there are eight burns.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then have the patient maintain stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a clavicle-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When much cold and dampness occur in the stomach, so that they draw it out of its proper state, and catarrhs multiply towards it, and frequent methods of treatment do not help, then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, with a cautery under the spoon of the breast bone the width of one finger with a key-shaped cautery, and with two cauteries below on both sides of the one cautery, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And keep a distance between each so that they do not join, when they form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cauterization is done be a single one in the shape of a circle according to this form. 
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by dotting it for someone who is afraid of this cautery: and it is that you mark a dot on the stomach of the size you want with ink: then cauterize it with a dotting cautery: then treat it with the treatment which was described before until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	¶ On the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and wetness, or from gross wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous evacuation, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and you mark with ink three cauteries according to this form, and this same size over the liver below the hypochondria, where the elbow of the man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be the width of a finger: and let the cautery be straight along the length of the body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very hard.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the amount that is burned in the thickness of the skin be half its size, not more: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	But if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who now stretches out his legs and raises his arms. 
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And indeed it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-like cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care not to proceed to the last in cauterization, and the entire thickness of the skin be burned, so that the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	On the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When a discharge occurs, and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, a dull pain and heaviness attack the patient without sharpness: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain: and now you see that its treatment has exhausted physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	It is necessary, therefore, that the patient lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the location of the abscess with ink: then heat a cautery that resembles a spoke.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one burn, until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches the membrane, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment of open wounds, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And one should not use this kind of cautery unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these illnesses occur with some experience: for then he may dare such an operation. 
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly, to leave it alone, in my opinion, is better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, that you should take of the long, dried roots of birthwort, one root, the longest that is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then submerge it in oil: and light it in the fire. 
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery between the junction of the collarbone with the neck, and with two small cauteries under the jawbone, slightly inclined to the part that is under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And also with two cauteries between the fifth and sixth rib, sloping slightly to the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries on the back: one between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be evident by the smell of the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And indeed some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron like a spoke: and they heat it, and insert it between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess itself, and the pus comes out: as we have said concerning an abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is danger, because either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which is incurable. 
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat a disease of the spleen, with what we have described of treatment in the section on diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then cautery on it is done according to three ways, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is that you make three cauterizations, or four, in a line along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of the liver, the illustration of which has preceded. 
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the space between each cauterization be the width of a finger, or a little more.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cauterization be the same as what we described in the cauterization of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient lie supine on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is this: that you heat the cautery having two points, which we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: and raise the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches: and let your lifting of the skin be across the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body. 
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two very hot points, until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them: then withdraw the cautery: thus four burns are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish, cauterize with another cautery having three points.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the burn after you allow it to discharge pus for many days: for this is more beneficial than all the other treatments that have preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	Cauterization is not applied in dropsy, except properly to ascitic patients.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have described in the section, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and with another cautery on the liver, and with a cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and with one opposite the chest, and another opposite the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not discontinue treatment of the patient after cauterization with it: because it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized, however, should be key-shaped, according as its form was described before: and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according as its form was previously described.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they swell up in a dropsical patient, and are filled with light yellow water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the dorsum of the foot at the knuckle, which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not repeat it at all. 
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the light yellow water will ooze out, and let the cautery be according to this form/shape. 
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizations on both legs, on each leg, and let the cauterization be done with the knife edge of the cautery: and let the cauterization be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below it, about the middle of the leg: and on each thigh two cauterizations: and leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time: so that some water oozes from it: then treat it with the other things that we have described.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in looseness of the bowels.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers, which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with methods of treatment, and is not cured: and you see the patient tolerating the cautery with excessive strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauterizations around the navel, thin ones, with the thin key cautery: and a cauterization on the buttock above the ischial tuberosities, a large one, or two cauterizations.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the pubic bone, and a cautery on each ilium: and perhaps you will add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	It is indeed a successful treatment, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	¶ On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from gross, cold humors, or corrupt humidities, and they are treated with what we have said in the section, and the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back below the sacrum somewhat in a triangular fashion, and with a cautery below the navel by about two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach has been chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and with a cautery over his liver, and another over his spleen, with a key-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	¶ On the method of cauterizing polyps after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise a polyp, then heat a cautery that resembles a spoke.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the heated cautery into the excised polyp: and withdraw your hand slightly until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which blood flows: do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If, therefore, there are many polyps, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what benefits them from among ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on a small pan, it is more effective in helping.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not submit to the incision and procedure that we described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When, therefore, a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes chronic, pus runs from it, and corrupted fluids.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is more fitting, therefore, that you should probe it with a thin probe. 
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then determine the extent of its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat a cautery that is similar to a spoke.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert it, ignited, into the fistula itself to the same extent that the probe entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupted tissues are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And beware of burning a nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein: or if the fistula goes to the wall of the bladder, or to the wall of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the area until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the area is sealed, and the discharge ceases from it, and it remains so for a long time, then you will know that it has already healed completely. 
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the discharge does not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is diseased bone in its depth, or something like that, the treatment of which will come in its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold, or from gross flatulence, and because of this one's strength is diminished, then it is necessary that you cauterize above the flank, above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery over the entire kidney using a key-shaped cautery, the description of which has come before. 
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the flank itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Thus, three lines will appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they will be of utmost benefit.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the back above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with one cautery on the right of the back and another on its left: and the length of that cauterization laterally should be the size of a thumb's knuckle: and cauterize him with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if you need to: and let it be a key-shaped cautery as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and dampness occur in the uterus, and because of this impregnation is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their flow is delayed, and pain occurs with their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said concerning the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the coccyx on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be key-shaped.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the hip in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous fluids are poured out at the hip socket, and become the cause of its displacement from its place: and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other, when they are compared together: and the place of the dislocation is found empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize the patient over the hip socket itself with a circular-shaped cautery: after you mark with ink around the socket, just as it turns: and so that the socket itself falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the shape previously described for cauterizing the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	But if you do not have this cautery available, then cauterize it with three burns, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint, and the causes of it are cold and wetness: and the patient is treated with what we have described in the section [on it], and the treatment is ineffective, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of gross humors with foul-smelling pills, or with compound pills, and similar things. 
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is, that you cauterize on his hip joint with three triangular cauteries, in this shape. 
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between each cautery be the width of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, cauterization is done in the middle, on the head of the hip itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, the form of which preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle contains the whole hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the entire thickness of the skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself, and does not extend to the hip and leg. 
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, on the place where the sick person indicates there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the ankle four fingers toward the outer part a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, three or four, or more, if he needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates the pain to be under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with one knife-shaped cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterization that you do not ultimately burn a nerve or a large artery with the cautery, and thereby bring upon the sick person a bad injury or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the ankle, and they persisted in cauterization, and the leg swelled up until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted: then diarrhea occurred, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	But if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each in this way.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men have spoken about the cauterization of the hip, the method of which cautery is this.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make something like a drill out of iron, whose diameter is half a palm, and at its opening, it should be the thickness of a date pit, or a little less, and inside that drill there should be a third drill.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between each drill be the size of a thumb knuckle, and let the drills be open on two sides, and let their height be about a knuckle or two knuckles, and make for them a handle of iron suitably fitted to the drills.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then it should be placed upon the hip joint, the sick person lying down on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round burns in one place. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "With this type of cautery, my sons, we have used it little, because of the frightening nature of its appearance: and because we have found few who can endure it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless it is among the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds the right place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cautery with burning medications is such that you make two hinges having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge pin of its gate of brass, or iron, the length of the wall: whose height should have two knots, or thereabouts.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space which is between each be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them contain each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it over the hip joint socket, with the patient lying on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly upon the hip joint socket.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles some hot water, which has been slightly heated with fire, and hold it there for the length of an hour: and let the patient endure its bite and its burning, for they will feel a bite like fire, until the burning subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And apply butter to it, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the ultimate in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	But if the pain extends to the hip or leg, make for it a bath that holds water, just as you did for the hip.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method for hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, one part of each: grind both and put them in a new pot, whose bottom is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that a ray may enter it: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour fresh water over the alkali and lime, so that it submerges both by a finger's breadth: after you have pressed them down well with your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water and pour it over other lime, and strain it until it is renewed/purified.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strongly sharp, which is used in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the medicines with which hemorrhoids are cauterized, are also arsenic sulfide, and anacardic honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And indeed Galen, in narrating, related the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which the pain of hemorrhoids and sciatica was cured; and he greatly praised its efficacy.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed at once, until he related that he himself perhaps entered a bath carried in, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is that some fresh, green hellebore is taken, and if green is not found, dry, fresh is taken, and it is ground thoroughly with a little fat, and placed on the hemorrhoid, where the pain is, or the leg, or on the hip, and it is bandaged and left for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the burning sensation abate.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then have him enter the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When, therefore, his body becomes dewy, have him enter the bathtub.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and cauterization is done in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be taken, and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep place, which is between the big toe and the ankle bone, and is nearer to the ankle bone.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and ignite it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat it.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore, do not cease to do this until the sensation reaches over the middle up to the hip, and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called punctate cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	On cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain happens in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar things, from an infusion of cold and moist matter: and cautery indeed is not applied except in this case alone, which arises from an infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	It is necessary then after evacuation of the sick person with foul-smelling pills, and similar things, that three lines be made on the back where the pain is, along the breadth of the back itself, after you mark with ink five cauteries in each line, or more according to the amount that arises from what the sick person can bear by his strength: and let the cauterization be done with a punctate cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries, or four, with a medium nail cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This ailment often happens to small infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is this: that there occurs in him a tightness in breathing upon elevation and movement: and you find at the end of the dorsal vertebrae and its nodes, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When, therefore, you see this, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, in this manner.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And the cautery should take hold over all parts of the vertebra equally: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, two lines, or three: and let the points be near to each other. 
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the area until it heals with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful not to apply the cautery to a hump which arises from a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in gout, and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains of the joints are from cold humors, which are poured out to the limbs of any body, then when pains happen in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name that gout specifically.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When, therefore, gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to puncture the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the other joints, and this happens frequently, then cauterize him over every knee with three cauteries, or four on each side, with this same key-shaped cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	However, if more are needed with this cautery, then cauterize him.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter. 
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the wrist bones, as the two lines turn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if any of the pains remain in the fingers, then puncture them, a puncture over every knuckle, and over the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend after some days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both on every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not remove the patient from a good regimen, from taking medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is followed, and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or omentum descends to the testicle, and it is incipient and nearby: then you must order the patient to forgo food on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And that he use laxatives, so that feces may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit on his back between your hands: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the omentum, or intestine, comes out or appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink below the rupture on the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to a half-circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then heat a cautery, whose shape is this, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then return the intestine, or omentum, to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the assistant place his hand over the area, so that the intestine does not come out: and you, having now spread open the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under him, and another attendant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands. 
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then apply the cautery upon the mark itself, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it there until you reach the bone with it, or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the bone with it the first time.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully watch against the intestine protruding during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and thereby cause either death or great harm to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is useless.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And the cautery for infants must be slender, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with other ointments until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And the patient should lie on his back for forty days, until the wound closes.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you arrange his nourishment for the duration of his treatment, which softens his bowels: so that the intestine does not protrude during straining and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then apply a properly made support bandage, and keep it on him for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And he should refrain from exertion, and overfilling with food and drink, and loud speech.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is followed, thus he is healed with a complete recovery.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will discuss the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and they are beginning, and you wish them not to increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery iron according to its size: and let that which is burned from then on be like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And indeed some of the early ones have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery iron, in this manner.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line towards the bottom.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery iron.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery iron is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in pains caused by a fall or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When pain occurs in some limbs from a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective for it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron. 
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cautery iron for each limb should be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the sprain, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	Therefore, if it is healed from the first cauterization, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cauterization on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is the custom of these pains to move from a limb to the one next to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to follow them with the cautery, until the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy, which occurs because of putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you want to cauterize it, consider [this].
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If, therefore, the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the section [on it], and it neither subsides nor stops: and you fear for the patient that corruption will seize his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head in a known place, and a second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And [hold] your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it makes a small impression on the bone, and the outer layers are displaced from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it is relieved, and also cauterize the spleen itself with the cautery, as described before.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries, which we have mentioned, on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheeks, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the buttocks near the base of the spine and one above it, on the coccyx itself, and two on the hips, that is, one on each hip, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize on each heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands. 
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the tendons that are above the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes one cauterizes with a cautery upon the pubic bone, and with another upon the breastbone, and with another upon the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial and effective it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery, as healthy people do: because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a size and smallness according to the limbs and joints, according to what was previously stated concerning the types of instruments. 
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the burn with a paste of flour and honey, and the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	¶ On the method of cauterizing for numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the numbed limb with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb, or its smallness, requires.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterization is applied for a certain numbness, which occurs in the hand and foot, on the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume upon this, except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs, and the emergence of the nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	¶ On the method of cauterizing for Albaras (vitiligo).
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras (vitiligo) becomes chronic, and nothing from the devices of medicine benefits it, then cauterize upon it with a cautery, slightly deep, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with chickpea flour and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of plantain, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part: let all these be mixed and spread upon a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	¶ On the method of cauterizing for Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it spreads.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	The experts, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But it does not seem so to me: because I fear that it would ulcerate: and I have already seen it sometimes.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said: or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	¶ On the method of cauterizing elephantiasis.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has elephantiasis, and it is delayed in ripening, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the age of the sick person, when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the ripening of the elephantiasis, then cauterize around its circumference with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with ripening.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you want its perforation with a cautery, then heat a cautery, whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the elephantiasis, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be on the side where the diseased matter will flow, so that the flow of pus is eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in a malignant ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption moving in a limb, and it corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If, therefore, you see a corroding ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then cauterize it with fire many times, with small and large cauteries, according to what is suitable for the place in which the corroding ulcer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it on all sides until you eradicate all of the corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil, until all the eschars are eradicated, and all the corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	Therefore, if you see that after three days flesh grows with a healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization on that which remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And a corrosive [ulcer] is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it takes the place of cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Nevertheless, cautery with fire is of swifter benefit: and I have indeed already described its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the section: therefore consult it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the method of cauterizing corns and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, callous thing, which harms the foot. 
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery on them is by two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for with fire, you should heat a hollow cautery resembling a vulture's quill: which should be made of iron, according to the size that encompasses the corn on all sides: and let it have thin edges. 
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it, heated, upon the corn.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn your hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a plaster to it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	But if they have not turned inward, and occur frequently on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then you should apply the cautery to them with hot water: and that is, that you should take a small tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it over the corn, or wart.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a little while, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the corn, and the hot water finds its way deep down to the root of the corn: and let the patient wait a while on the bite of the hot water for one hour. 
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with them one after the other until you come to all of them that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in tremors.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When a tremor occurs in someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and above his stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor subsides with an olive-shaped cautery, and healing of a cold ailment is hastened.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	¶ On the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes ugly Albathir, that is, pustules, which arise from gross corrupted matter, erupt on the body.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	It is therefore necessary when they first appear, that they be cauterized over the entire head of the pustule with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, the tip of which has been ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long birthwort.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized superficially, at the beginning of their eruption in this manner: and they do not increase: and the superfluity causing them is broken up, and is healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Frequently there happens a flow of blood from an artery, which is cut near a wound that occurs externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or the cauterization of a limb, and things similar to these: and it becomes difficult to stop it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore when this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place upon it your index finger: and squeeze it tightly, until the blood is held back under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put in the fire small olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones in number: and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery has been ruptured, and apply the cautery upon the vessel itself, after you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood flow is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and the cautery is extinguished, then quickly take another cautery, from the cauteries which have been prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another, until the bleeding is stopped.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve which is there, lest another injury befall the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except by one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Either with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. 
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood flow is stopped.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a thread with a strong knot.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines with the property of stopping blood flow are placed upon it, and it is bandaged with a compress with suitable tightness.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, whoever performs its removal with a ligature, and binding with cloth, or placement of burning substances, and similar things, this does not help it at all, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this happens to someone, and a doctor is not present, nor medicine: then they should begin by placing their index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and pressing it strongly, until the blood flow is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, and cold water of extreme coldness [should be poured] continuously upon it, until the blood congeals, and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile they should consider whether it needs cauterization, or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already spoken in the First Chapter about every illness in which cauterization with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed there chapters from the crown of the head to the foot. 
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the one searching may be relieved in their search.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin this, it is necessary that you learn, o sons, that there is in this chapter from terror that which is in the first chapter concerning cauterization. 
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, it is necessary that there be more vehement caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often occurs, with which life exists, at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which are associated trembling and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes there fall to you in this art kinds of people with kinds of illnesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him: because of the intensity of that which he encounters from his illness and the length of his suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness there is from fear that which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives his payment and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious. 
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not appropriate for you to agree with him who comes to you from among them whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything of it, except after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a laudable outcome has come.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And in the treatment of all your patients, use prognosis and an indication of that which is suitably healthy.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is your aid in acquiring fame and glory, and remembrance and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire in you, O sons, his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed I have arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into sections, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that the inquiry which you want from it, and which you need, may be made easier for you.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often happens to babies at birth: or when the midwife squeezes the baby's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this sickness in others than in children: and for all those whom I saw with it, death hastened: for that reason therefore it seemed best to me to forgo operating on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head enlarged every day, until he could not sit up by himself, because of the size of his head: and the wetness increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this wetness either gathers between the skin and the bone or gathers under the bone above the membrane of the brain.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation for it, if the wetness is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head, one incision across: and the length of the incision should be about two knuckles, until the wetness flows. 
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the spatula.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	Therefore, if the wetness is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the wetness is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides, and the fluid is depressed when you compress it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the wetness.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the incisions with cloths and cushions.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then smear it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound tightly.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the patient all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of fluid appears.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, proceed with the incision where the abscess and the filling of fluid appears to you: and cut it as much as you can.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And take care not to cut an artery, and a flow of blood occurs, and the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of fluid.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When catarrhs occur in someone to the eyes, or to the chest, and that becomes chronic, and treatment with medicines is ineffective: then the ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	It is necessary therefore, when you wish to incise them, that the patient shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the patient bind his neck with some cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men. 
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with ink over each: and incise each with a scalpel sharpened on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let this be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood comes out in a pulsating flow, which leaps inwards with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then you should measure from the ear a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what you should let out of blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will let out more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then attend to the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if any proud flesh remains on the bone, then cut it away, so that a hot abscess may not occur: then bind the wound with linen bandages.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	¶ On the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person experiences a chronic migraine, or acute catarrhs due to sharp humors, and heat in the temples' tissues, or a severe, chronic headache, and things similar to these: and he is treated with methods of medical healing, and it is not effective: then we have tested in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in their extraction is that the patient shaves the hairs that are on the temples and focuses on the artery appearing on the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it reveals itself to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by the intensity of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the place with hot water until it appears to you manifestly.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I fashioned a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it gently, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then cast a hook into it, and draw it upwards, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it come forth from the membranes which are under it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	But if the artery is thin, then wrap it around the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut off from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are extended, and drawn together, and bleeding does not occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not cut off, the blood does not ascend completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then drain from the vein six ounces of blood, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk, or of gut strings, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the consolidation of the wound, and bleeding occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut off the excess which is between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this in that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery, even to the bone, with a knife-shaped cautery, until its ends are cut off, and it will remain in place of the same procedure.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever, or is of a hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is among those things which help to finish off/dry up humidities/fluids.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the removal of arteries, it is necessary that the place be filled with old cotton, and cushions neatly made be placed over it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the loosening/release, it should be treated with dry medicines, which make flesh grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood happens from an artery, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with vitriol, and tighten your hand until the blood is stanched.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	But if none of those things is at hand for you, then place your finger over the place until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And bathe the area with very cold water, until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And of that which is lighter and easier than the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades; and let the sharpness of the two blades be like a lancet. 
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two blades, cold quickly affects both of them: and they do not cut the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, when there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: this method therefore is better than any method, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space that is between the two blades be the width of a finger, after you mark two places with ink: and place both blades, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its ends is elongated.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of the flow of sharp, persistent tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are persistent tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull of the head, and treatment with medicines is of no benefit in these cases, and you see the face of the patient already reddening, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their lashes are now corroded with the corrosion, and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears, then the ancients relied on this operation in treating them, and they called it the treatment with the knife. 
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut three equidistant incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers long, and let one incision be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length a little way from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides: and keep your hand away from the joining of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the width of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dried cloths, with which you may dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a two-pointed spatula, the form of which follows immediately.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and with it, peel off all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the periosteum, which is on the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this spatula, and insert again into the first incision another instrument, which is called a sharp knife, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues to that which appears of the skin. 
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure as far as the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, squeeze the places of the clots of blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put into every fissure a tent of old linen cloth, and place on them small cushions soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And take care that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the bandage, and administer much irrigation with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ On the treatment of acute epiphora and catarrhs in the eyes arising from inside the head.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs happen to someone: and you see their eyes thinned, small, and their sight is already weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and the hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp, painful ache deep in the head, and sneezing follows: then understand from these symptoms, that those matters, and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment in these cases is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And that is, that you direct the patient to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in it, in the middle of the forehead, or a little bit further along its breadth, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until, when the bone is exposed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the wound with old cotton, or with linen bandages.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bandage over it with small cushions: and soak the cushions with wine and oil, so that a hot swelling may not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot swelling is now diminishing, then you should rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying medication which makes flesh grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of rosin: and you prepare a plaster from them, and it is administered for the generation of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything which falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans: or it is a flowing thing, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When, therefore, a stone or a kind of stone from those which are not absorbed nor grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: then if you see the stone, instill into the ear some violet or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and cause a sneeze with pepper, and block the nostrils at the approach of the sneeze, after you place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For often it comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not come out, then administer its extraction with a small hook, that is, with fine tweezers: the form of which is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If, therefore, it comes out with the hook, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine blunt hook of little curvature.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If, therefore, it does not come out by that, then make a tube from bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear deeply, and stop up what is around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the air except through the tube: then extract it with your breath by strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For often it comes out with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If, however, it does not come out in this way: then take some helkalimbat, or from mistletoe, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a moderate amount: and put it on the end of a probe after you wrap cotton decently placed around it: then insert it into the opening of the ear gently, after you dry the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If, therefore, it does not come out with all that we have described, then quickly proceed to cutting, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of cutting is that you first phlebotomize the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw blood from him according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then have the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision in the root of the ear near its lobe in the depressed place: and let the incision be moon-shaped, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments you can.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the incision immediately with speed, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then proceed to extract it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not yield to your attempt to remove it, then take a thin, slender spatula, shaped like this.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And with it proceed to cut off that kind of grain which has fallen into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you have broken it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a slender probe, or by suction, as we have said, for its extraction is thus made easier.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But for water that gets into the ear, the patient should use sneezing with pepper at first; and he should also fill his ear with a little old cooked oil and lie down on the side of the affected ear.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it then comes out in this way, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take several stones, about the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and he should hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	He should not stop doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And so the water comes out in such a way that you take one of porphyry, or of reed, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until a large part of it is burned. 
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat with another reed, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a small tube as was described before with the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In extracting an animal that enters it, if it is of a small body, such as a flea, and similar things, treat it as I said in the chapter.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of a large body, which is apparent to the senses: then administer its extraction with pincers and hooks: and the matter of it is easier than all the things that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In extracting a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the chapter, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment is not effective: then it is necessary that you examine the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If, therefore, something of the worms appears there, then extract it with pincers, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a small tube, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above: and insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates: then suck with it with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to the exit, then coat the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said for the stone. 
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with what we have said, then administer distillations which the ancients have already tested in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring, by which you pour oils and medicines into the ear, be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it of silver, or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore, let the pusher, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be suitably made of bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a probe and wrap cotton around its end with a suitable wrapping: then drop oil, or juice, or whatever of these medicines you wish, into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the probe with the cotton on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is pushed into the cavity of hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and let what is poured into the ear be already warmed a little with fire: and beware that nothing which is instilled into it be very cold: for the medications do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of blockage occurring in the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs not perforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also sometimes happens that some men experience a blockage in the ear canal from a wound or flesh growing in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this blockage sometimes occurs in the depths of the opening of the ear, which the eye cannot reach, and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the opening a little, and the eye can reach it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That blockage, therefore, which occurs deep in the ear and which sight cannot grasp, is in most cases difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which the eye can reach, you should place the ear of the sick person in the sun and look into it: then if you see a visible blockage, open it with a thin spatula, the shape of which is as follows: let its tip have a small width, a part of which is sharp, and let the rest of the spatula have two smooth sides so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If, therefore, the blockage is from flesh growing in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook and cut it with careful force until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	But if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a thin, smooth probe and warm it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If, therefore, you feel the blockage with it, which the patient experiences with difficulty hearing, attempt to open it gently, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a tent dressing according to the size of the opening, which you have coated in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a tent dressing and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle powdered burnt alum on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	But if you see that the ear is now developing an abscess, then it is necessary to remove the dressing and replace it with another dressing that you will coat in a wax salve made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed. 
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge, or cloths, in cold water, and place it over the ear, and use the rest of the treatment, which stops the flow of blood described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the treatment of altheli of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These altheli which occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore you should grasp them with forceps or with a hook, and cut them out from their roots with a small spatha.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered alum on the area.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if they bleed, then cauterize them with a fine lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterizing them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something of their roots remains.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	¶ On the treatment of hailstone of the eyelids.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something happens in the eyelids which is likened to hail in its strength and its hardness, and because of that it is called hailstone: and it is a collection of thick humor in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The procedure then for them is that you consider then if it is a hailstone proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its matter is simple.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Make therefore upon it an incision lengthwise.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then peel it from every part with ease, until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then lift it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if its removal is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then that harms the patient somewhat.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the incision is large, then join it with a suture, and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and makes it heal.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the hailstone is sloping downwards toward the inner parts of the ear toward the inner surface, then turn the eyelid inside out, and lift the hailstone with a hook, besides which you need an incision, and press it on every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, that does no harm at all.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water, and treat the place with something that heals, until the patient is cured.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ On the treatment of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and it happens mostly in boys, and it burdens their eyes, and they have catarrhs in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears hurry to them, and because of that you see them always reclining on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which swelling has now covered, and the bulge of Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare bandages in it, and make from that bandage a circle according to the size which contains the Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it upon it and press with your fingers on every side, so that the Axirnath is gathered together in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then cut in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions lengthwise, and let not the incision be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy, in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut the whole skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many temperaments the Axirnath comes out through the incision in the form of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with a cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers, to the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and be careful not to go deeper in the incision, lest you reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should go deeper in the incision a little, gently, until the Axirnath comes forth.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with compresses.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some people who grind salt, and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture dissolves.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if a hot abscess should occur in the place, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	¶ On the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, from which it happens that it wrinkles as it should not.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow in the eyelids of the eye, added beyond their usual course under the natural hairs, and grow stiff: then they harm the eye, and cause types of illnesses to occur, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and whiteness, until it becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Either by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was stated before in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by reeds, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into it, in which there is a thread, from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the probe.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then cut on the inner part of the eyelid under the added lashes with a lancet, cutting from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth: then mark upon the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, because this varies in people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them is one who needs to have a large amount of the eyelid cut, according to the amount that is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with a lancet cut on the two lines that you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let one cut be near the natural eyelashes, as thick as a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then remove all of that skin.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then join the two lips with a suture, with a needle and thin woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make what is superfluous from the threads adhere over the two eyebrows, with some sticky things, if you want to do it: and if not, don't worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for up to three days, or four: afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its joining: but it will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of treatment for ectropion.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, in it there is concern for the patient, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is also another method for ectropion: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a shape that is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have explained.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, separate or joined, according to the following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with an even incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it is not made even: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and a second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct: and hold the threads evenly between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand evenly: and lift the skin over which the mark has been made, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: and treat it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, an abscess occurs near your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a poultice, and similar things, from among soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it also happens to the eyelid, that its hairs turn inward. 
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is therefore necessary that you use on it what we said about the incision: but the suture is more skillful for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the treatment of tonsils with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is on the inside, according to what I explained.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already cut notches at the ends of each on both sides where you hold the threads. 
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then skillfully join each one over that which is superfluous from the eyelid, and tightly bind the two reeds on both sides with a strong tie, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the constricted skin will die, and blacken, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it strengthens, the eyelid will be raised: and the hairs will not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	¶ On the lifting of hairs pricking the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The procedure for it is that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth thread of silk.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then bring together its ends, and tie each with a very fine knot: and the length of the threads should be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then arrange another fine thread beneath it in the needle-holder briefly, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation is clear: because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the needle-holder into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural eyelash.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up over the needle-holder: and insert that hair into the needle-holder: whether it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the needle-holder in the eyelid along with the natural eyelash.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	But if the needle-holder is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the needle-holder downwards, with the thread which you placed in it, until the needle-holder comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of your eye: for then you will pull the needle-holder, and the thread: and draw out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it. 
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	But if the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is lifted with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a while, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	¶ On the treatment of trichiasis which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this trichiasis happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this trichiasis is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental therefore arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operating on it is that you split that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and put between them a tent of linen, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the trichiasis returns worse than it was: rather use on it things that soften, like fenugreek: and foment with water, in which has been cooked marshmallow, linseed: and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap a tent with it, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the key to your treatment is that you strive with all your skill, that it does not consolidate, according to the form which it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is nothing but a certain correction of the trichiasis, so that the form of the place does not return entirely as it was.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	¶ On the treatment of trichiasis which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This trichiasis that occurs below is what is truly called trichiasis.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And accidental trichiasis arises from a wound, or a fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you prick it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If, therefore, the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two incisions be at the two corners of the cut, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh in the quantity that its lower sharp side is, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts: sew it with woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, about softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an ectropion happens from an incision, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a smooth incision under the hairs of the eyelids, just as preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the gist of the discussion concerning the treatment of ectropion, when it is above or below, is that the procedure be carried out in it, according to how it is prepared from the form of the ectropion.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it itself is of many diversities in form: and the prudent practitioner prepares his skill with whatever method is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to the natural form, or near it, and the sick person himself, according as it suits him from the procedure and instruments in most arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adherence of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	It is necessary then that you insert the end of the probe under the eyelid, and lift it upwards, or stretch it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which is not with the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather is a little blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure, and the spatula is removed and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were peeling that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed. 
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, then wash it with water, or instill into it from a preparation made of verdigris dissolved with water. 
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen wick: and place over the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use the preparation, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	¶ On the incision of a nail and fleshy eminence of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a nail exists in two forms.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is sinewy: and it is similar to a hard, thin film.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not sinewy, similar to frozen white moisture: which, when iron touches it, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types begin only from the larger tear duct, until it gradually advances, until it covers the sight, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating in its incision is this: that the patient places their head in your lap. 
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then grasp the membrane with a hook of small bend, and stretch it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and bend the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the membrane: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the membrane with the thread, and stretch it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the membrane that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair to its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the rest at the base of the tear duct with a thin spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that a constant flow of tears may not occur from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the membrane is stretched with the hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is scraped with a smooth spatula, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware lest the spatula touch the cornea, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, put some crushed salt, or something made from burnt lead acetate (zinc oxide), into the eye, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	But if it is a non-nervous pterygium, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of pterygium is often treated with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the chapter.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	But if you want to incise it, then open the patient's eye and take a thin, smooth spatula, not sharply pointed, like this shape.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the pterygium from above, scraping delicately.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	But if you see that it thins and breaks up, and the scraping makes an impression on it, then at once instill into the eye sief made from verdigris, or red sief, or crushed salt: and bandage the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the procedure until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless you encounter a hot abscess in the eye: then leave it alone, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the procedure on it with the scraping tool, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if an outgrowth of lachrymal flesh greatly harms the eye, let it be lifted with a hook, and cut off part of it: and do not complete the incision, lest the flow of tears be affected.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then drip into the tear duct red sief, or that made from burnt copper, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ On the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh growing in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in some human eyes grows a red composite flesh, or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or comes near it, or presses on the eyelids, and sometimes turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a pomegranate blossom.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also this, that the patient places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with forceps, or a gesti.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then first incise the flesh until all of it is finished off with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you incise it, be either with a spatula, which we described in the incision of the nail: or with small scissors, with which earwax is collected, according as its form will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is completed, and all of the albugo is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or instill into it red powder, and things similar to it from corrosive medicines: and place on the eye from the outside cotton with egg white: so that it may be protected from a hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	But if any of the albugo remains, and hot blood prevails in you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the extra flesh that occurs in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye from a natural cause, or from an accidental cause, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand in any of these operations, until you see that that member is tolerating that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ On the removal of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and prevent its function of sight: and weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	It is necessary therefore for you firstly, that you consider, if the eye in which there is Sebel, is strong, and there is no other disease in it, besides Sebel: then remove its Sebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And you should instruct the patient to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then lift those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be of a fine double form, according to this shape, or let there be two hooks stepped in one body, according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then grasp with fine scissors those veins delicately, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are released: and be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the instrument.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very steady in your work: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red sief: so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the film. 
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	But if it is not possible for you to remove all of it at that time, then cover the eye with that which soothes eye pain: and leave it for a few days, until its pain subsides: and protect it from a hot abscess: then repeat on it in the same way, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the shape of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	¶ On the reduction of a fractured nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call Arissati a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp, burning medicine, according to what was stated previously.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not healed, then there is no remedy for it except to cut open the abscess at its source, and extract all the moisture and pus that is in it, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, the form of which is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a head rasp.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made from Indian steel, and let its head be round like a probe, which is dotted with the dots of a file, or with the fine dots of a rasp: and place it on the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand down a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the area with drying, styptic medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If, therefore, the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off, and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not form an abscess, and no accident occurs in it: then you will know that it is now healed. 
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no other option than to redirect the fistula to the opening of the nostril, according to this method.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you expose the second bone with an iron instrument, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let the tip be iron, triangular: and its wooden handle be a pyramid tapering to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the tear duct: and move your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: because he finds air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Then treat the area with styptic and drying medications, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When, therefore, flesh grows and the area hardens, then the matter which flowed outwards returns to the nose: this is therefore easier on the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ On Reducing the Protrusion of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes completely, and there is no damage or diminishment to vision, then you should loosen the patient: then phlebotomize him: afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then compress the eye on top of the plaster with many small cushions.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the small cushions is: that you take many soft cloths, and each cloth of them should be folded four times: make many of them: then place them one on top of the other, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then compress over them with a hard cloth, tightly.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage again softens, then it is necessary that it be tightened a lot: then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the uvea of the eye now restored, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the small cushions, and the bandaging, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On the incision of the uveal tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the uveal tunic, then it protrudes and projects beyond the eyelids like a grape seed, and the appearance of the person is made ugly because of it, and you wish to incise it: then the operation on it is, according to what I describe: and it is, that you insert a needle into the base of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle on which there is a double thread from the side of the tear duct, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incise the location of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the circumference of the needle: and tighten it a lot.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white: and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the uvea is constricted from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye swells considerably.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture flows, and the eye recedes, and immediately returns to its place: then bandage it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ On the treatment of al-Qamnat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness, which is called al-Qamnat, is nothing but pus, which gathers in the eye, similar to dripping water, but is not the same.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is that you have the patient sit on a prepared or upright seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take their head in your two hands, and move it until you see the pus come to the bottom part of your eye/eyesight.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it should be fixed, and not descend, and the vision should be restored: and the patient should see things as they saw before: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the pus is not achieved by what we have described, then have the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula, and split with it a little above the cornea on the covering, near the joining of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the corona, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed. 
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	¶ On the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or a cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and which is suitable for perforation, with a clear and explanatory discussion, then take that same one according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then, therefore, you should have the patient sit squarely between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it firmly: then [take] the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take the needle with your right hand, if the eye is the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the tip of the needle near the edge of the iris by the width of the radius in the white of the eye appearing at the smaller tear duct: then push the needle with force: and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye: and you feel that the needle has now reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And the measure of the needle's path into the depth should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the edge of the blackness: and that is the edge of the iris.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see them in the pupil itself with the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle as far as the place where the fluid is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards repeatedly.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the fluid descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, with the needle in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the fluid descends, then lower it a second time, except that the needle should be withdrawn.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is inserted, and does not ascend: then withdraw the needle easily: and turn your hand back gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water and wash the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the eye some tow, or wool soaked in rose oil, and egg white: and bandage the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, however, and those who are of our time, place upon it ground cumin with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	But if the needle does not yield to you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since there are people whose eye is very hard, then you must take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, pierce only the conjunctiva with it, and do not force your hand in the hole, but only make a thin path for the needle.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the needle, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, let a suitably made sleeping chamber be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a darkened room, and let him be forbidden all movements and coughing, and give him food that soothes his nature, and let him not move his head right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain according to his condition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that darkened room and test his vision, and make him see things. 
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not appropriate to do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, it is necessary to delay it, because water rises quickly through intense looking.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a hot swelling occurs, then it is necessary to uncover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with something that soothes the swelling until it subsides: then completely uncover its vision, and place over his face something perforated by which his vision is directed below it for some days, he being in that darkened room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should leave the room gradually, and go about his affairs.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in eye surgery the student is not excused from occasionally watching; then he may dare to perform the operation. 
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed there came to us someone from among those who are of Al-Andalus, who said that there was made in Al-Andalus a perforated tube, by which water is sucked.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Truly, however, I have not seen anyone in your land who has made that, nor have I read of it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that this is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the types of tubes, so that he who is ignorant of them may consider them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made specifically of bronze, and let their ends be triangular with this same fineness, and the tip sharp. 
Formae magda.	Forms of the tube.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	The Treatment of Flesh Growing in the Nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes various superfluous fleshy growths arise in the nose, some of which resemble a many-legged scorpion; and among these is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark color; and among these is smooth flesh, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in the case of those fleshy growths which are soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit facing the sun, between your hands, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into those fleshy growths; then draw them outwards, and cut what you have grasped of them with a thin, sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	But if any of it should remain, which cannot be cut away, then scrape it with a thin instrument, gently, until none of it remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	But if bleeding overwhelms you, or a hot abscess arises, then treat it accordingly; or if it is among the malignant abscesses, then quickly cauterize it until the bleeding stops, and all the fleshy growths are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine, should be applied into the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens and moisture proceeds from it as far as the palate, then you know that he is now healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh growing inside on the upper bones of the nose, which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then, therefore, it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of a certain thickness, and tie many knots in it, placing between each knot the width of a finger or less; and the patient will find a way to insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it like a probe, and he should draw it through his nostrils until it reaches the throat and comes out over his throat. 
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, street boys in schools often do something similar to this, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread together, the one end which comes out over the nose and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then perform the sawing of the flesh with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now engaged with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the thread: and after cleansing the blood, place in the nose a tent which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then, at the end of the procedure, place a tube of lead in the nose for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if it needs a treatment that dries, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a head-purge, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it out of silver, or bronze: which should be like a small lamp, open like a seashell: and its opening likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the bowl of the instrument for making a head-purge should be full, uncovered: to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices, and flowing things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	¶ On the treatment of nasal polyps.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a polyp grows in the tip of the nose, and enlarges, and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate it completely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place upon the area either a cautery, or a burning medicine which remains in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore its incision is delayed, until it enlarges, then consider, if it is stony, hard, dark-colored, with little sensation: then do not touch it with an iron instrument: because it is a cancerous ulcer. 
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen one who incised such an ulcer, and great harm resulted from it upon the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the ulcer is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that incision is possible in its entirety, then bleed the patient, and incise it without fear, without dread: and treat the area with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suturing of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a break in continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, an operation accomplishes little, except in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, when something like this happens to someone, that you consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood: and then join the two lips of the wound with a suture: then treat it until it is healed.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the broken continuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy, then it is necessary that you excoriate every part from its visible skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then join the two lips with a suture, and tighten them, and sprinkle on it dragon's blood, and ground frankincense: and place on the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bandaged for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then untie it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads fall off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing, however, is that you join the broken continuity, either with needles, as we described in the suturing of the abdomen, or join the wound with thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of nodes of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Indeed, many men usually suffer hard abscesses inside their lips, similar to grains of a plant, and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, you must turn the lip, and cut over each of its nodes, and lift it with a hook, and incise it on all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then rinse it with vinegar, and treat the place with something that is astringent, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	¶ On the incision of flesh growing over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often excess flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should lift it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow. 
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the area powdered alum or other styptic, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	But if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	¶ On scraping teeth with an iron instrument.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, foul scales accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and out, and between the gums, and sometimes they turn black, and become yellow and green, until corruption from this reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul from it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and the tooth, on which scales and something like sand appear to you, until none of them remain, and do the same with the blackness, and the greenness, and the yellowness, and other things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	So if what is on them is removed at the beginning of the scraping, that is good: and if not, then repeat the scraping on them on another day, a second, and a third, until finally the effort achieves what you want.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes, of many figures, according to what is prepared for your operation: because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Concerning the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should treat a tooth for its pain with all your skill, and delay its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing to replace it when it is extracted: because it is a noble substance: until there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to extract it, that the aching tooth be strengthened and confirmed by you. 
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For pain often deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in a healthy tooth and extracts it: then the pain does not go away, until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have seen this from the work of bloodletters.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When, therefore, the aching tooth itself is confirmed by you, then it is necessary for you to scarify around the tooth with a lancet, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers, or at first gradually with fine forceps, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and the patient's head between your knees, which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If, therefore, it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on all sides with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary for you to fill that hole with cloth and tie it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your squeezing on it with the forceps. 
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you proceed carefully with scarification around the gum on all sides extensively.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And take care with your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and a worse problem than his first pain returns upon the patient from it.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware lest you do that which ignorant bloodletters do in their haste, and their boldness concerning its extraction, beyond what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For many times they cause great infirmities to happen to people, which are more difficult to cure, and all its roots remain, or some of them: or so that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have witnessed many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then after its extraction, the area should be rinsed with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	But if bleeding happens from the places (for it happens often), then grind some vitriol and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the vitriol doesn't work for you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the fine forceps with which a tooth is moved at first, should be of long extremities, a short handle, thick, so that they are not bent when they are pressed upon the tooth with them: let them be as you see of thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not yield themselves, nor are they bent: of short extremities, and let them be made of Indian steel, or of good quality steel, suitably made, of straight extremities: and at their extremities let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a fitting, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are made like the form of the mouth of the bird which is called stork, and they are of strong grip.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the extraction of teeth, and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, during the extraction of a tooth, some broken part remains, then it is necessary to place on the area cotton with butter for one day, or two days, until the area softens: then insert into it probes, or forceps, the ends of which resemble the mouth of the bird which is called a stork. 
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This, moreover, is the form of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file on the inside: or like a small scraping tool.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you take care with respect to the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short at the tip, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If, therefore, the root comes out by means of that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is of a triangular tip, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	A form of a thin triangular tip.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also, one is helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which were described earlier in the discussion of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	There may also be assistance with this instrument that resembles a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular tip, in which there is some thickness, so that it may not break: and let it be unsoaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly other instruments are not counted, and the prudent artisan, skilled in his art, finds by himself the instrument, according as the operation itself and the diseases indicate to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because among illnesses there are some for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, a bone of the jaw, or of other bones of the mouth, is broken or putrefies, then investigate it in its place with that which is suitable for it from among the instruments and forceps that I described for the extraction of roots, and assist with the gesti, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be in it some thickness gradually, so that the bone may be grasped or held with it, and may not escape and go, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is a small amount of decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the sawing of teeth projecting above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth project out not according to their natural course, the appearance becomes ugly because of it: and especially when it happens in women, and girls, namely those who are marriageable.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not situated [correctly], or its sawing is possible, or its filing: then extract it: and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and it is made of Indian iron, with a very sharp point.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision, by which you cut it, be over many days, both because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not disturbed. 
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing: then file it with a file of Indian steel, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole be of Indian steel, and its handle of very small points, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed, and falls out: then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	But if it is a tooth, from which a part is broken, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even, and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On binding teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When a concussion and disturbance happens to the front teeth from a blow, or a fall, and the patient cannot clench down on what he eats so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not been effective, then the skillful thing to do with them is that they be bound with gold wire: since silver turns green, and decays after some days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount of space between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And indeed, the method of binding is that you take the wire, and insert double its length between two healthy teeth: then you weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether it is one, or several, until you come with the weaving to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving up to the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with delicacy and skill, until it does not move at all: and let your tightening with which you tighten the wire, be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the superfluous ends of the wire with scissors: and bring both together, and turn them with pliers: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue: then leave it thus tightened as long as it remains. 
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it becomes loose, or is cut, tighten them with another wire, and it will hold with it in such a manner for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the binding of two healthy teeth, and two loose teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after having fallen out, and are retained as we have described, and remain: and only a skilled and experienced practitioner does this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes something is adapted from the bones of cattle: and it is made from it in the form of a tooth, and is placed in the location from which the tooth has fallen out, and it is fastened as we have said: and it remains, and is used thus for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	On the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue, and impedes speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue, is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the procedure for it is, that you open the mouth of the patient, with their head in your lap, and elevate their tongue: then you cut this sinewy ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its restriction.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	But if there is some hardness and knotting in it, and that results from the consolidation of a wound: then cast a hook into it, and split it across its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is loosened. 
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And take care that the cut is not deep in the flesh, and that you cut into an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then the site of the incision should be rinsed with rose water, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen compress, which the patient should keep in all night: so that it does not adhere again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if bleeding occurs, then place ground vitriol on the area.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a freckle cautery, which is suitable for it: then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of the ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a swelling occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth facing the sun: and examine the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If, therefore, you see it of a dark or black color, hard, which the patient does not find sensitive: then do not touch it, since it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then cast a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it on all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	But if the blood overcomes you during your operation, then place ground vitriol on it until the blood is staunched: then return to your operation until you extract it completely.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then rinse it with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the remaining treatment suitable for it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes swellings occur between the throat, that is, glands, which are similar to swellings that occur externally, and are called the two tonsils: when you treat them with what we have said in the section, and they are not healed, then consider...
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	Therefore, if it is a hard abscess, of a dark color, with little feeling: then do not touch it with an instrument.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and its base is large: then also do not touch it with an instrument, fearing the flow of blood; rather leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will lance it or it will rupture by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its base is slender, then it is necessary to incise it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the procedure with it is that you consider, before operating on it, if its hot inflammatory swelling has completely subsided, or has diminished somewhat. Then, therefore, have the patient sit facing the sun, and let their head be in your lap, and open their mouth, and have an assistant take [their tongue] between his hands and press their tongue down with an instrument, of which this is the form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze, and let it be thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When, therefore, you press the tongue with it, and the swelling is shown to you, and your gaze falls upon it, then take a hook and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you pull with it something from the membranes. 
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles scissors; however, its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite the other, sharply. Hence, take care that it is made of Indian steel, or imbibed steel.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a scalpel, of which this is the form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have incised one tonsil, incise the other according to this same manner of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if a flow of blood should happen to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and things similar to these among styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore incise them according to what I said concerning the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I once treated a woman with an abscess, which arose between her throat, which tended toward a dark color, barely perceptible, which had already almost closed the throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating, and drinking water: and she would have arrived at death, if she had remained for one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had ascended so much that it had sent out two branches, until they emerged above the two openings of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore I hurried quickly, and I fixed a hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out of it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off, where I grasped it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same thing to that which protruded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and depressed her tongue: and afterward I fixed the hook into the swelling itself: then I cut off part of it, and nothing ran out of it except a little blood: therefore the woman's throat was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not stop cutting from that swelling many times over a long period: and swelling followed in the place of that which I cut, until it and she became extremely weak.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised (a plan), and cauterized the swelling between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore she stopped getting worse: then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	¶ On the incision of a swelling of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh descends to the uvula, and it swells, and is long: then it is called elongated: and if it is thick in the lower part, round, then it is called grape-like.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we said in the section [on the uvula], and the treatment is ineffective: and you see that the hot swelling in it has subsided, and is thin: then you must incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what of it is gathered together round, and has no length, and is bloody, or dusky in color, or black, and has no feeling: then you must avoid incising it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in that there is danger to the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	It is necessary therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I described, by its whiteness and length, that you make the patient sit facing the sun: and depress his tongue with the instrument, whose description preceded: then fix the hook in the uvula, and draw it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I described for the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you incise of it only what extends beyond its natural limit, without further addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you incise more of it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we described for the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the patient is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cautery on it is only with sharp water: and it is that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press down his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take some of the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and mix with it quicklime, not slaked, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the hollow of this instrument, whose form is this, with it.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let its end, in which the medicine is placed, have a hollow, like the hollow of a spoon's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself: and let the patient be lying on his side, so that saliva runs out of his mouth from inside [due to] the medicine, so that none of it descends from it into his throat, and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you, from the beginning, [hold] it upon the uvula for the amount [of time] of half an hour, until you see it now blackened, and the bite of the medicine calmed.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the probe, and soak the cotton with the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton in the cannula from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times until you achieve what you desire concerning the cauterization of the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it: for it will dry up and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse what is around it from the medicine: and let it be rinsed with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And let it be treated externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This type of treatment, therefore, is healthier than incision and further from danger.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something that is more subtle than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and black cumin, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and boiled: and let the pot be properly sealed with clay: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze: and let the end, in which is the seed, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor rises through the tube to the uvula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware of performing this treatment at the onset of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually increases the abscess: and you should not do it except near the end of a hot abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed, and place eggshell on the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is not burned, since eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is a good and safe treatment.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else gets stuck in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you should extract what is visible, after you depress the tongue with an instrument in the sunlight, and what is in the throat is revealed to you.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, you should cause the patient to vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached object will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the patient should swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or swallow a mouthful of dry bread: or take a piece of soft, dry sea sponge: and tie it on a string, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the thorns, or bone, are, and it is pulled out, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have described: then use a lead instrument according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be a little thicker than the radius, and at its end let there be a curvature, which he inserts into his throat with ease: and he should hold his head raised upwards. 
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And he should beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough seize him, and he push the bone or thorn with it, or the physician should insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the patient insert it, this is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing, and he should push it downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the size that is prepared for it, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is treated with what I said in the section on treatment with medicines, and it is not effective, then examine the patient's throat in the sun, or near the sun after you press down his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If then your gaze falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps carefully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	But if it is not possible with these: then take a hollow tube, and insert it into the patient's throat nearly to the gullet: then insert into the hollow of the tube an iron heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a glass vessel full of cold water and open his mouth over it: and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow any of it: and let him stir the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately upon sensing the water falls out.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument that I described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, because it will fall out.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot should be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument should be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then cast the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth at the end of the tube, and let him close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall out.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	But if it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that it comes out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when sight falls upon it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its tip is like the beak of the bird which is called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to what has been mentioned about them, namely one by one, in this book: and they differ in their perforation and incision in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the type of abscess itself, and what it contains in terms of fluids.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second way is because of the locations in which it occurs on the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess occurring on the head is different from an abscess occurring on the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own method of treatment.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among abscesses, there are those that should not be perforated, except after the pus within them has matured and reached its fullness: and among them are those that should be perforated while they are unripe, and not matured to fullness.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its existence is prolonged until what is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or tendons of that joint are destroyed: wherefore it is a more likely cause of contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either it or, through it, the principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it while immature: and it is not necessary to perforate an unripe abscess, not fully digested, except what is near the anus, lest the deep part putrefy, and it extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become at its edge something that is not healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess, which is matured according to completion: and it is with the cessation of pain, the receding of fever, and the lessening of redness, and throbbing, and the pointedness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make that same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and its strongest prominence: and let the perforation go along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all similar places, in which there is no bending.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those that bend, proceed with the perforation along that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better that you leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said, according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you perforate it before that, the flow of corruption from it is prolonged, and it is of much filth and dirt, and perhaps its edges and its depth will harden.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are perforated across the width of the body, when necessary, or according to what the limb requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses, or many incisions according to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out and incised when it has become like cloth, and has reached the point that it is already dead, as happens in many cases, such as boils and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are some of them which are cut with a three-cornered incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one from which an incision is made like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an abscess of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are some of them in which a round incision is employed, and a lunar incision, and others similar to these incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But that which does not have a head, such as mild superficial abscesses, you should pierce it with a superficial perforation, or simply a flat one.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not rush and extract all the pus at that time, but rather extract part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then plug the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times gradually until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or a decrepit old man: for the vital spirit is often released from the living being with the discharge of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not realize it. 
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound, and examine it.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If, therefore, the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is shallow, then apply lint made of linen, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, it is necessary then that you insert lint into every fissure until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have cut away part of the skin, or have made it concave around the edge, then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or scraped with the down of linen without moisture, and bind it until the third day. 
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then discard it, and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, bleeding should occur during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them, and place it upon the site of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the bleeding continues, then you must apply the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book of ours, and in the section.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is in the winter time, and the location of the abscess is [one] of many nerves, then you must soak small cushions with warm wine and oil and place them over the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must place small cushions soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until, when it is the third day, as we have said, then you must open the abscess, and cleanse it, and apply in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This, therefore, is what is necessary concerning the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses generally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	However, following the path of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how the way to its treatment is chapter by chapter, individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	On the incision of abscesses that occur in the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the type of nodules, which membranes contain, which are sacs for them: as if they were a hen's crop.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are fatty: and some of them contain a moisture similar to mud: and some of them contain a moisture similar to bran and porridge: and similar things, and some of them are stony hard.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as an artery does not cause an obstruction during their incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the procedure for their incision is that you examine them with an instrument, the form of which comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is one that contains moisture, then cut it with an incision along its length with a superficial incision: according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the incision from line b to line g. When, therefore, the moisture is evacuated, then peel away the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave any of it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if any of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remains of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat with the Egyptian cotton a second and a third time, and if you need to, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains, then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	But if the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it in this way, with an incision in the shape of a cross, and insert hooks between the two lips of the incision, and peel it from every side, and strive with all your might to extract the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if an artery gives you trouble, then do what I will tell you later. 
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise with the abscess, if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision on a stony abscess is easier because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses which are on the head in certain men, with which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is this: because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and I found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone were struck with it by throwing, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses, however, occurring on the head, besides those abscesses which occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus downwards may be relieved.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	¶ On the incision of Scrofula in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And of those that occur in the neck, there are single and multiple: and they are generated from one another: and every Scrofula of them is within its own membrane, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have described.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the types of these Scrofulas are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And of them some are stony: and of them some contain fluids: and of them some are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in the one of them that you see of good disposition to the touch, whose color is clearly close to the color of the skin, and is movable in every direction, and is not connected with the nerves of the neck, nor with the jugular vein, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: you should cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line b to line g, and skin it on all sides: and spread the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we have said about the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually. 
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is with caution that you do not cut a vein or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the spatula not be very sharp: so that your hand does not slip with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary. 
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut a vein or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then put ground vitriol in the wound, or some powders that staunch the blood, and bind the wound, and leave it alone, until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped by alum. Therefore, return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger if anything remains of the other small pustules: then incise them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein at the root of the pustule: then you must not cut that pustule from its root: rather, you must tie it with a strong double thread, and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old lint, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the pustule is cut entirely, then you must bring the two lips of the wound together: and sew it up immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that some excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then you must endeavor to cut its root, and extract it: and administer the suture which we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And as for those pustules which contain fluids, pierce it with a superficial perforation: so that the location of its ripeness appears to you: and position the perforation away from that which follows lower on the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the perforation, apply lint with ointment, and things similar to them, so that it may erode what remains of the corrupted matter, until you see the wound is now cleansed: then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	¶ On the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this incision of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it: and this is the writing of their discussion.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those having quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided: since no benefit comes from it: because all the veins and the lung are weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	Truly in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the trachea, the incision of the epiglottis should be used, in order to escape the destruction which arises from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should incise the epiglottis below the three rings of the epiglottis, or four, with a small incision across its width, between two of the rings for a distance such that the incision is in the mucous membrane, not in the cartilage: and this place is indeed suitable for incision, since it is lacking flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	But if the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should cut the skin, until when he comes to the trachea: he should avoid the blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the mucous membrane that we have described: and the incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it, along with its being broken open, and the loss of voice. 
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When, therefore, the time in which suffocation is feared is past, join the two lips of the skin wound, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which promote the growth of flesh, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis says.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The gist of this discussion which we have related is explained only when they see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the throat of the patient: and the patient is near death, and his breathing is about to be cut off: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe somewhat through the site of the wound, and be saved from death: and for this reason they directed to leave the wound open, until the harmful effects of the disease are resolved, the harmful effects being about three days: then, therefore, they directed to sew the wound, and treat it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I myself saw was that a certain maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and with it cut part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her making a sound like the groaning of the dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore uncovered the wound, and I found the blood that had come out of the wound was small in quantity.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I was confident that she had cut neither a vein nor an artery: and air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore, I quickly sewed up the wound and treated it until it healed: and nothing happened to the maid except hoarseness in her voice: and after some days she returned to better health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that in a cut to the epiglottis there is no danger.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ On the incision of a goiter.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This swelling, called goiter, is a large swelling, the same color as the body: and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it exists in two forms: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	The natural kind is certainly not treatable.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental kind, however, exists in two forms: one of which is similar to fatty nodules.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other form is similar to a swelling which arises from a knotted artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in this there is danger, and one should not presume to treat it with an iron instrument, except in the case of a small one: and test it, and examine it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If, therefore, you find it similar to a fatty nodule, and it is not connected to any veins, then cut it, just as nodules are cut: and extract it with what it contains of a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with the appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the incision upon types of nodules.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of nodules, and I have already described all their types in the classification: and it is necessary that I describe here the difference between a nodule and a fleshy outgrowth: since it causes doubt. 
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say, therefore, that with a fleshy outgrowth there is heat, and fever, and intense pains, until the boiling of excess humor subsides, and the putrefaction is complete: for then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	With a nodule, however, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and a membranous cyst contains them, which is their own sac, and it is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a gourd, and larger and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either fatty or containing fluid.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of the fluid are many, as I have described in the classification.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	It is necessary, therefore, when you come to the treatment of a nodule, that you first examine it, and explore it with the instrument which is called the probe, according to its form which will come in the chapter after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining abscesses, and all nodules, is that you take this instrument, and insert it into the most humid place, which you find in the abscess: and you turn your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then withdraw your hand according to the extent of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the probe, and examine what comes out in its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If, therefore, a flowing moisture comes out, whatever the color, then drain it with a superficial incision, as I have described in the case of other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not come out in the track of the probe, then know that it is fatty: therefore make an incision over it in the shape of a cross, in this way, as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from every side with care: and preserve the cyst if you can over it, so that you may extract it whole with the nodule.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the cyst ruptures during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for that happens often, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if any of it remains, little or much, the nodule usually returns.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if it defeats you, and a little of it remains, then fill the wound, when you have finished, with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place over it something to draw out the remaining abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore the nodule is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with something that promotes flesh growth.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if you encounter an opposing vein, pulsating or not pulsating, then hurry, and fill the place with ground vitriol, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood subsides: then return to incising what remains of the nodule.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	On the forms of instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among these are the forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of Indian steel with suitably squared ends, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of probes, or perforators: and one of them is called a drill, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and sinuses, and fistulas, and buboes by means of what is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely, from boxwood, or from bronze, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those which are made from boxwood.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And probes are also made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas, in whose concavity are bends, so that they may bend with their smoothness along with those bends.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because among them are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the extent of the width and narrowness of the fistula.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The Form of Hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For among them are simple ones, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of Scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and excised: and they are of three kinds: for among them is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed in such a way except so that help can be given with them in the excision of nodes with fear of cutting a vein, or nerve: and so that the weak person may be healed by them, and find some relief from the burning which he experiences with the excision of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are probes, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of bronze, and are similar to the probe with which kohl is applied: and at the broad end is hidden the point of a small spatula: and it moves in it inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of small spatulas which are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the patients do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of bronze, or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be slender.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that you have these kinds of cupping glasses, large and small, so that you may quickly cut off the flow of blood with them in time of need, and when you do not have medicine at hand.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you should not use them to cut off blood flow in every part of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy places: such as the calves of the leg, and the hip, and the muscles of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments are made from them, similar to pistachio shells, according to their shape: with which blood is stanched when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round from them according to this form. 
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	¶ On the treatment of men's breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to have nocturnal emissions) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain foully abscessed.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever abhors this, it is necessary that he make a lunar incision over the breasts, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove all the underlying fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards fill the wound with an incarnative medication.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	However, if the breast inclines downwards and softens because of its size, as happens with women: then it is necessary that it be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the shape of a crescent moon, each of which joins with the other at the ends of each, until there is a longer line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards remove the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is cured.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the restlessness of the patient, or because of the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the uvula.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses that occur under the uvula are a type of hard swelling that contains cysts, and among them are those that contain fluids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those among them that contain fluids should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this diagram, from line b to line g. When all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day. 
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the cotton should be removed, and it should be treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	But if the abscess is a kind of nodular swelling, then incise it as we have described in the section on swellings, in the same way. 
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound spreads in such a way that it emits pus, then apply cautery to it, according to what we have said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it heals, an abscess frequently results: and similarly, it also happens with a vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are these: for when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, collected in the depths of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a throbbing in it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And cutting into this abscess is a mistake, especially one that is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its treatment with a knife should be avoided, and those that are also on the extremities, or on the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, over that which is from them due to a swelling at the opening of an artery, make a lengthwise incision in the skin.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from its coats until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the removal of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then puncture the place that is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and the swelling is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it until it is healed. 
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	But if the swelling is due to the cutting of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the swelling with the skin as is possible for you.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the needle under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the swelling with it in a good ligature, according to what I told you concerning the tying of the uvula, from both sides with the two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread may be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole swelling near the incision of the needle: press and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the swelling in its middle, until that which is in it comes out: then cut away the excess skin, and release what is tied off from it. 
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it a small cushion that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	¶ Concerning a swelling which arises from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter 50.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as a swelling occurs in an artery and vein, similarly a swelling occurs in the nerves: which happens in them from a blow, or happens from excessive work, and similar things: and it happens mostly to them in the places of the joints, or the heel, and in every place in which the joints move: and it is a serious swelling.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in most cases without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, the patient feels in it something like numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a swelling gathered in the depths of the body, but it is under the skin, and it itself moves to every side, and it does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the posterior parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what of these is in the joints, it is not appropriate that it be attacked with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction will occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that of these which is in the head, or in the forehead, cut the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If, therefore, the swelling is small, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then lift it with a hook, and peel it: then remove it, and close the wound with a suture: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	¶ On the incision of a swelling, which occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter 51.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Frequently in the bellies of some men, and in other parts of their bodies, occur swellings, which are called fungous growths, because of their resemblance to fungi. 
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their edges are inverted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	Indeed, I once saw a man, and on his belly there were two swellings, which were more like fungi than anything else: there was no difference between them, white, with slender roots, and their edges were inverted and split, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, I cut them out, and I found the weight of one to be about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces. And the procedure for cutting them out is as follows: consider then, if the patient is of a moist humor, and the color of the swelling is white, moist, with a slender root: then cut it out with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries ready in the fire. 
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled when it is cut: therefore, hurry, if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see that the patient is afraid and fearful of being cut with an iron instrument, then take a lead wire suitably fashioned, and tie the swelling with it: in the way that we have described, and leave it for two days. 
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then tighten the lead ligature.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore, do not stop tightening the lead, as often as it makes an impression on the swelling, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without difficulty.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the swelling has a thick root, then there is some cause for fear and alarm in cutting it: especially if it is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless, it is possible that you may cut off half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware of presuming to incise a swelling which is dusky in color, has little sensation, and a foul appearance: for this is a cancerous abscess: and I will return with a discussion of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	¶ On the treatment of a protruding umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter 52
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	A protruding umbilicus arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Either from tears in the peritoneum, which is over the abdomen: and intestinal fat, or intestine, protrudes from it, similar to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, as was stated before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from wind compressed within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is due to a tear in the peritoneum, and protrusion of fat, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its appearance, along with what we have described, is of a more intense difference.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When, therefore, you press it with your fingers, it is concealed; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it is greatly enlarged upon entering a bath, and [after] strenuous exertion.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, however, it is due to fluid, it is soft; then it is not concealed when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is due to blood, then with these signs a swelling tending toward blackness appears.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If, however, it is due to a fleshy growth, then the swelling is heavy, thick, hard, and fixed in one position.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If, however, it is due to wind, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the procedure in this case is that you should then consider if the protrusion of the navel is due to blood of an artery or vein, or to flatulence: then you must refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and danger in that, as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings caused by an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine, or omentum, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath and to stand upright outstretched.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel, over the place that you marked with ink.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then stretch the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it tightly around with thread, or with a cord of silk, with a firm knot: and let the knot of the tie be knotted securely. 
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess, stretched above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If, therefore, you find it already grasped by the ligature, then draw it out securely, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find an omentum, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if an artery or vein opposes you, then tie it off tightly. 
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert two strong threads into them: and insert the two needles into the perimeter you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the stretched flesh putrefies: and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	But if the protrusion of the navel is from proud flesh in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with that which strengthens the area.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	The Treatment of Cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed in the section on types of cancer, and how the way to treat it is with medicines: and that one should beware of treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate: and we have spoken of cancer originating in the womb, and the caution against its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as a cancer that is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and similar parts, from the members located outside so as to extract it completely: especially when it is beginning and is small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	However, when it becomes chronic, and is large, one ought not to approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not cure anyone of it: nor have I seen another before me who has achieved this.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the procedure on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you should go before and purge the patient of black bile several times. 
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then bleed him if you find him with obvious plethora.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he should be placed during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then cast upon the cancer hooks which are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards hollow it out on all sides with the skin, according to investigation, until none of its roots remain: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, but rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein creates a problem for you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 54.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already described in the section on types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs, and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only the type called ascites alone, and iron is not applied to the type called tympanites, nor at all to the type called hyposarca, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your medication has not helped, then consider [the following].
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already become weak, or has another illness besides dropsy, such as a cough or diarrhea, and things like that, then beware of treating him with iron, because that is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see the patient is of strong constitution and has no other disease besides dropsy alone, and is not a child nor an old man, then the method of operating on him is as follows: you have the patient stand upright between your hands, and an assistant behind him compresses his belly with his hand, pushing the water toward the lower part of the groin.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a pointed scalpel, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a scalpel.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be some shortness in it, gradually, so that you do not penetrate through to the intestine during the operation and injure it. 
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the cause of the dropsy is in the intestines, then it is necessary that you make the incision a distance of three fingers below the navel, directly above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the cause of the dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then make your incision three fingers to the left of the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the cause of it is the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and also the incision should not be on the side on which the patient is accustomed to lie, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weakened place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert it into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and abdominal wall, as if you were skinning it: and let the amount that is skinned be the size of a fingernail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce in this way, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then withdraw it, and insert into the hole an instrument, of which this is the form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a small tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: at its lower part there is a small hole, and in its sides there are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end is made incised, like the cut of a reed pen, as you see: on its upper end there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore drain out about half of the water at that time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you drain out more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient dies from the depletion of his vital spirit, or he suffers a fainting fit that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But drain it according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the patient's condition indicates to you from the strength of his pulse and from his well-being.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is held back immediately by the skin which covers the hole that is above the peritoneum: concerning which I have told you that you should pierce it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat with the instrument on the next day, if you see the patient tolerate it: and also draw out a small amount of the fluid.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until not much of the fluid remains.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of the fluid: then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the fluid: according to what I have described in what has preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant comes forth from his mother's womb, and the glans of his penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is therefore necessary to remedy this with its perforation immediately when he is born with a very fine scalpel, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place in the opening a thin nail made of lead, and tie it: and keep it there for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When, therefore, he wants to urinate, it should be removed, and he may urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which passes over the place will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are injured/harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because, for those who are born [with it], the opening is at the end of the head of the penis: therefore he cannot urinate forward, unless he lifts the penis with his hand upwards.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor does he have procreation, because the semen cannot reach the womb directly: and it is a very foul affliction.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient is laid on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then stretch the head of his penis with your left hand with strong stretching, and cut the tip of the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp point or a pointed scalpel: as is the cutting of a reed, or as you scrape something, so that its middle becomes like the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should. 
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of the flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore apply to it something that stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning sores that happen in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 56.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These sores often happen on the penis, and it is a swelling of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And of this, some is malignant, and some not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore you should lift up the non-malignant one with a thin hook and cut it away, until you clean it completely. 
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put upon it cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then after that treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	But if the albather is malignant, of a foul color, then you must apply cautery to it after incising it and scraping it. 
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	But if the albather is on the prepuce of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the albather is under the foreskin, and part of it outside: then you must remove the albather which is inside first, until when it is strengthened, then treat the outside: because when you treat it all at once, the prepuce is not protected from becoming constricted.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And indeed blackness and decay also occur in the testicles and prepuce.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	It is necessary, therefore, that you hollow out everything that is already blackened, and what is about to decay, or is already decayed.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then after that smear on it honey that has been mixed with flour of pomegranate rinds, and sifted crushed herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	But if a flow of blood should occur, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is helpful for two conditions at the same time, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it decays.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole is destroyed within an hour: then it is necessary that you insert into the urinary meatus a tube made of lead, so that the patient may urinate through it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the prepuce with the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur, except in him whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: it is necessary therefore that you excoriate it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides. 
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	But if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then it is necessary that you excoriate something from the head of the penis, and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the prepuce is thin, perhaps it is perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the prepuce and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	On the cleansing of infants, and treatment of an injury accidentally happening to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: nevertheless, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it a better operation, and an easier way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Which is, because I found the majority of surgeons and bloodletters using cleansing, circumcising with a razor, and with scissors: and they use alum, and tying with thread, and incising with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I did not find any better than cleansing with scissors and tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains: therefore, it is necessary to cut again to incise the other, and future pain will result. 
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing which is done by alum, that is, a thimble, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the male member is not made safe: because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing, however, with a nail, perhaps the iron slips, and ruins your work: and indeed the skin of a boy is naturally short, and many times they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with scissors, and tying with thread, good experience has revealed to me: because scissors are of proportional incision: because the sharpness which is above is just as the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharp edges come together, and they cut according to one action at one time: and compression occurs in a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the method of the proper operation is that you cause the boy to think, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, that you are doing nothing except tying a thread on his penis only: and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that is possible for you, insofar as his understanding allows.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then have him stand prepared between your hands, and not be seated: and conceal the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand to his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it of any dirt that has collected on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie a second ligature a little below it.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold firmly with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the penis.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and place powder over it: and over the powder a cloth on which is spread the yolk of an egg cooked in rosewater, shaken with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on it until the next day: and treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	Now the shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be cutting: lest the branch of the nail extend beyond them: and let the length of the two sharpened edges be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	However, an error occurring in the cleansing is this: because perhaps the entire inner skin escapes, or part of it, at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore it is necessary that you stretch it out immediately with your fingernail before the formation of pus in the area, and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	But if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then draw it out with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if three days have passed, and what is under the penis remains swollen, having formed an abscess, then leave it alone until the hot swelling subsides, and peel it easily, and incise it as it is presented to you: and beware of the head of the penis.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore treat it with something that heals the wound from the powders, which we described in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and it extends to the upper parts, that also does not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from a blockage made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or generated flesh, and things similar to these among those we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the section.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is because of a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be on his knees, bent over.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as is possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, with the neck of the bladder constricted, the stone is forced out toward the back: for this reason the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	But if it is not released with what we have described, and the matter is urgent for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, hollow like the quill of a bird's feather in the thinness of a spoke, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: which has a thin tube at its tip. 
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the manner of the exit of urine through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool, or cotton, to its end with a good knot: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if any of the wool is superfluous, indeed insert it into the tube forcefully, like a piston.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit upon a seat, and bathe the bladder and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water. 
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then bend it upwards from the side of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe within it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has now arrived at the empty space: and this is not done according to this method unless, since the passage, into which it goes, is in which is winding. 
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then draw out the thread with wool little by little.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then withdraw it and let the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat the syringing, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the method of injecting the bladder with a water clock.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is confined in it, and you wish to instill water and medicines into it: then this should be done with the instrument called "Clepsydra", and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is, in fact, plugged, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, in which is that which pushes, should be according to the quantity that plugs it without addition, so that when something is drawn with it, of the fluids, it is drawn in: and when it is pushed, it is expelled with it to a distance, just as the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when you want to inject fluids into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the fluid, and draw that which pushes upwards, for the fluid will be drawn into the hollow of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into the urethra, as we have described for the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then inject the fluid with that which pushes it, for the fluid immediately reaches the bladder, so much so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a thin clyster with which the bladder is clystered.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or brass: whose upper part is similar to a small alembic, and below it a groove between which the tie falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a ram's bladder, and put in it the liquid with which you want to inject the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between the two grooves with a strong tie of double thread: and warm that liquid a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the syringe into the penis, then tighten your hand on the bladder with the liquid with a suitable tightness, until the patient feels that the liquid has now reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and perforate it all around its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, as a moneybag is gathered: after you have put in it what you wish of liquids, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the liquid reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	On the extraction of a stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already discussed in the section on types of stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of all of that: and I spoke of the stone in which an operation by hand and cutting is appropriate: and that is the stone generated specifically in the bladder: and that which is stuck in the penis: and I am explaining this with clear explanation and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say, therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder, happens most often in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its thinness: and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and it hangs down often. 
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it becomes erect, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of boys is easy, from then until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	In youths, however, it is intermediate, in that which is between that: and the treatment of him whose stone is larger is easier: and if small, the opposite is the care of it.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When, therefore, we come to the treatment, it is necessary first of all that we cleanse the patient with an enema, which will extract all the excrement that is in his intestines: for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the patient be taken by his feet and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes jump from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit prepared between your hands, and let his hands be under his buttocks, so that the whole bladder is inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If, therefore, you feel the stone in the area, then immediately proceed with the incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall at all under your touch, then you must wipe the index finger of your left hand with oil if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth, and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone until it is under your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder. 
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you want the incision; and instruct an assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to draw away the skin, which is under the testicles, on the side from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the cutting scalpel, the shape of which is as follows.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And cut between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock; and let the incision be over the stone itself, and let your finger be in the anus; and make the incision transversely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, according to the size that allows the stone to pass out, but not larger. 
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone near the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that there are stones which have angles and edges, which is why their exit is difficult.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And some are smooth, similar to a gland, and round, and their exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, for the one that has angles and edges, enlarge the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	But if it does not come out this way, then it is necessary that you be ingenious with it: either grasp it suitably with forceps, the end of which is like a crescent moon, which grips the stone, and it does not escape from it: or insert a subtle instrument with a curved end under it.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	However, if you cannot manage it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	But if any blood overcomes you, cut it with a saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	But if there is more than one stone, then first push the large one to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut down upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, push the small one after that: and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut down upon it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because one of two things happens to the patient, either he dies, or a constant dribbling of urine occurs: because the area does not heal completely. 
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But manage its expulsion until it comes out: or devise its breaking with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece. 
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have therefore completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot swelling settles down.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When, therefore, you loosen it, bathe the area with water and plenty of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, an added hot swelling occurs in the wound, and corrosion, and things like that: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is blocked from it: and that is known from the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply every type [of medicine] with what is suitable from the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the treatment's entire duration that you bind and join the two thighs, because of the medicines which are placed upon the area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	But if the stone is small, and it is in the urinary passage, and it is lodged in it, and the exit of urine is blocked: then treat it with what I describe before you resort to cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For many times you will be spared from cutting by this treatment, for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a Perforator from white iron, whose form is this, three-sided point, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie the penis with it below the stone so that it does not go back to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the penis gently, until the Perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the Perforator with your hand in the stone itself little by little: and you try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is released immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks and goes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not available to you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards loosen the tie, and cleanse the clotted blood, which is made in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And the tying of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not go back to the bladder: and the other tie above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for that reason it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards, so that it returns at your completion, and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of a stone from women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	A stone is rarely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone should happen to occur in one of them, then the treatment is difficult, and is avoided because of many factors.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially surgery with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: therefore it requires a deep incision, and in that there is danger.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	But if necessity compels this, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-versed: and few are found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you are deprived of her, then seek a chaste physician, skilled, and present a midwife well-instructed in the matters of women, or a woman who in this art hints at part of the art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her, so that she may do all that you instruct her concerning the examination for the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, which is, that she should see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, let her grasp it with her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the patient, and examine for the stone, after she places her left hand above the bladder, and compresses it with good compression. 
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she brings it to the base of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then let her cut down upon it opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the hip, on whichever side is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that area: and let not her finger be moved from the stone, grasping it from below: and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then let her insert a probe into that incision. 
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then let her enlarge the incision in proportion to the size of the stone so that it may pass out of it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these are small and large, smooth and rough, long, and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, you should know its types so that through this you may be informed about what you want.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore the bleeding overcomes you, then apply to the place powdered alum and hold it there for one hour, until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation until the stone comes out: and see to it that you prepare from among the instruments, which I spoke about regarding the extraction of stones in men, so that you may use them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut, then put powder on the place and bind it with compresses, binding it firmly, and do not change it, and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after a few days, and the place festers, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On the incision for watery hernia. 
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white membrane, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called a membrane.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in a membrane of its own, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is thought: that it is another egg, and it is the skin of the testicle between the white membrane, which we have mentioned: and that does not happen except rarely. 
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And indeed, the generation of this hernia is from a weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color is tending toward yellow, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or it is watery white, and that is what is most common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is located are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white membrane that we mentioned, then the abscess is round, somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the fluid surrounds it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the fluid is in its own membrane, then the abscess is round, with part of the egg shape, and because of this, a person thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the fluid is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the senses. 
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you want to know the color of the fluid, then test the color of the fluid in the abscess with the square instrument, whose form has been described previously.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to what comes out on the track of the instrument, judge concerning what is within it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	Therefore, when we come to treatment with the scalpel, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body is full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should be laid on his back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right, who should stretch his penis to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the abdomen's mirach.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad scalpel, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, nearly to the pubic bone: and let the cut be made straight along an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it comes to the encompassing white membrane: and peel it and watch, or beware lest you cut it: and let your peeling whereby you peel it be on the side that hangs down with the testicle more: and carefully explore by peeling as much as you are able.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the membrane, full of water, with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the membrane upward, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicles: and cut the membrane however you can cut it, either whole or piecemeal, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not investigate it thoroughly, the cutting of it will not be secure, but the water will return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the cutting of the membrane, put it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find the testicle corrupted by some blackness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and extract the testicle; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if fluid is collected in both parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part just as you did in the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the abdomen's mirach: and place folded cloths on top, and they are cushions: and tie them on top with a bandage, which has six heads, according to this form/fashion.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then let two cloths be taken, and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends with which it is pressed be made of cotton, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with a binding at the lumbar region of the arms: and let one of the ends take hold above the anus as far as the back, and let the second take hold at the part of the pubis: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and let the whole binding be gathered at the lumbar region of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this branch is skillfully treated with a cautery instead of incision with a knife: and it is, that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and you cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have described: until when the white membrane containing water is revealed: then take a cautery, according to this form/fashion.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It resembles the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce that membrane with it, and it (the cautery) is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the membrane with hooks, and peel it off with a thin, heated cautery, and cut it as much as you can, until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware of the testicle, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and further from bleeding, and better than operating with an incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if a hot abscess, or bleeding, or something else causes you difficulty during the time of incision, or during the time of cauterization, then you must treat whatever causes you difficulty with the appropriate treatment, according to what has been stated before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is timid and cannot withstand this operation because of its dreadfulness, then perform perforation as I describe it, and it is as follows:
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certain, by the signs we have described, that the hernia is watery, then you should have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a broad lancet: and make the opening lengthwise to the body, and let the opening be wide, so that all the fluid may run out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place cotton over the area and bandage it, and leave it so that the remaining fluid can drain; then treat it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is an obstruction to the flow of fluid at the time you pierce it, and this is only because the white membrane creates an obstruction at the opening of the wound and prevents the fluid's exit, then you must insert a quill into the wound, or an instrument with which the fluid of dropsical patients is extracted, the form of which has been shown previously: or enlarge the wound in the operation a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And you should know that the fluid returns and collects again after six months, or approximately that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it collects, then let it be pierced again in the same way, and the patient will survive.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the treatment of a fleshy growth.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that cutting this growth is, in most cases, to be feared as leading to destruction.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, leaving it alone seems to me to be safer.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am mindful of operating on it, and the type of abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, therefore, that many abscesses occur in the parts composing the testicles: and this happens from many causes, namely:
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from a sharp or pungent excess that flows to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, the color of which is dusky, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the knotting of the arteries, and their swelling, as its mention has already preceded: or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	That therefore which is from them, from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the character of the abscess, when you strongly compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	Truly that which happens from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it disperses upon compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that an incision be made upon this appearance, and upon the other flesh: and it is so that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the testicle upwards, and draw it out with the white tunic: and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the spermatic cord after you free it on every side from the parts of the testicle.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If, therefore, the testicle is hardened with those fleshy growths, then it is necessary that you draw out the testicle, and incise it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between some part of the tunic or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is a fleshy growth in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and draw out the testicle, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	¶ On the treatment of varicose veins, which are with a vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	A varix is a swelling wrapped in a certain covering, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and movement, exercise, and walking become difficult for the patient.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of that which was mentioned before.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary that we describe the operation on it according to what the ancients did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, therefore, that it is necessary that you have the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspensory of the testicles downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels which are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with strong tension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad, sharp scalpel with a transverse incision directly on the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape from every side, just as we told you regarding the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards, fix in them a needle on which is a double thread, and tie it off in the first of the places to which the veins run: and tie it off again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and extract what is collected of foul, corrupted fluids.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which you wish to generate pus, so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles may fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no harm through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the vein happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary for the testicles to be extracted because of this, along with the vessels: so that the testicle is not deprived of nourishment, due to the incision, and wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them. 
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The origin of this hernia is from a cut, which occurs in the membrane stretched over the abdomen in the part of the groin from an abdominal wall rupture.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	For this reason the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the membrane or its distension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the distension of the membrane.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	Is that it happens gradually over a long time, and it does not happen suddenly: and the swelling is uniform toward its depth: because the membrane compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And its sign when it is from the cutting of the membrane, is that it causes severe pain to occur suddenly from the beginning: and the swelling is irregular, appearing close under the skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its passage to the outside of the membrane.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes a rupture comes forth with the intestine: and this is called intestinal rupture, and hernia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes excrement enters the intestine and is retained there: and with it is the danger to the patient: because it causes severe pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the types of this illness with a knife, there is danger: therefore it is necessary to be cautious in acting in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you instruct the patient to replace the intestine with his hand to the inside of his abdominal cavity, if it yields to replacement.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should be laid on his back on your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the entire skin of the scrotum lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according as you need to open the incision with them: and the incision should be according to the size that is possible, so that the testicle may emerge from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then peel off the tunica vaginalis, and what is under the skin of the scrotum, until the white, hard tunica albuginea is revealed on all sides: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white tunica vaginalis, which is under the skin of the testicle, and between the second tunica vaginalis, and loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the testicle. 
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move the skin of the scrotum inwards with your right hand: and with this stretch the tunica albuginea upwards with your left hand: and lift the testicle with the tunica vaginalis towards the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards: and you loosen the adhesion, which is behind, with a complete loosening.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And search with your fingers, so that there is not any part of the intestine wrapped up there in the hard, white tunica albuginea.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find any of it: then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread, made of twisted linen from ten threads: and insert it at the edge of the tunica vaginalis, that is, of the membrane, which is under the skin of the scrotum that follows the incision: then cut the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over others in a figure that is in the form of a cross: and tie with them the tunica vaginalis, about which we have spoken, since it is under the skin of the scrotum with a strong knot, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess may not arise from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another tie outside the first tie, less than two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ties, leave from the tunica vaginalis, which is under the skin of the scrotum, an amount the size of a finger: and cut the entire remainder along the circumference, and remove the testicle from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the scrotum an incision, from which blood and pus run: as we related in what has been previously stated.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the bandage that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white membrane that we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its falling is delayed, then it should be fomented with warm water: and put over it what we have described, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning a varicose vein.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this varicose vein I have not seen anyone who has dared attempt treatment of it with a knife.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first indeed said, that it happens just as we explained in the varicose vein which is with a vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, that you ligate the vessels after the incision over it easily lower down: then cut in the middle, and afterwards treat with that which opens it, until the vessels fall off: and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Regarding the rupture which occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all times: but if the time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the peritoneum, until the intestines descend into the peritoneum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the distension of the peritoneum, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	Which is because the peritoneum is distended: then the place softens, and forms an abscess, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with the cautery, as its description has preceded.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this way: and it is, that the patient lies on his back in your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the place of the ruptured abscess and protrusion, cutting across, to the extent of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then compress the fascia and what is under the skin until the white peritoneum, which is under the skin that follows it, is revealed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum, and press it into the depths of the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two protruding places of the peritoneum over the end of the probe, and tie them together with a suture; then withdraw the end of the probe.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor stretch the testicle, nor anything else, as I made you aware in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it by the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When, therefore, you cut the threads, cleanse it and dress the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the peritoneum contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture is not increased.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to a cure.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles softens in some men, on account of which the flesh between them softens, and their appearance is marred.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back, and to cut away all the skin that is softened, down to the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then join the two edges with a suture: and if you wish, first sew the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat as with other wounds, until it heals, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of that it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine: and mentioning it is not necessary, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is, that it be within the physician's knowledge when he is asked about it: and that he may know the treatment for one to whom it happens.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our benefit from it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by crushing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by splitting, and cutting. 
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by crushing, the method of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand, until they dissolve and do not appear to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by splitting and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory [muscle], and cut over the whole testicle with one cut, until when the two testicles protrude; then incise them after you have skinned each one, and do not leave anything of the membrane on them except the thin membrane, which is on the vessels. 
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, for which reason the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	The Treatment of Two Kinds of Hermaphrodites.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite from men is of two kinds.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in him that following the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a shape as if the vulva of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one type, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubic bone like the testicles of a man, quite small, protruding outwards: one of which is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three types, two from men and one type from women, is: that it is necessary to cut the extra flesh until their mark disappears. 
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second type of men, however, from which urine comes out, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all for it.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	¶ On the incision of a swelling, and of flesh protruding in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A swelling is perhaps added upon a natural part until its appearance becomes ugly and foul; and sometimes it becomes so enlarged in some women that it stretches out as in men, and becomes suitable for intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is necessary, therefore, that you hold the excess of the swelling with your hand, or with a hook, and cut it; and do not go to extremes in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	Now, an arisen flesh is a flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb until it fills it; and sometimes it emerges outside like a tail, and because of that some of the early ones called the ailment "tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, that we cut it just as we cut the swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	¶ On the treatment of Alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is when the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental type is from a preceding illness: and this indeed happens either from extra generated flesh, or from a thin membrane, or a thick one: and it occurs either deep in the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps also prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it comes through examination by a midwife, if the blockage is apparent and near the surface.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	However, if the blockage is from a thin membrane, and it is near the two labia: then act quickly, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And you should place small cushions over the two labia.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place the index fingers of both your hands together, and the woman should be on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two labia firmly until the thin membrane is broken and the blockage is opened. 
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the area: and the woman should have intercourse every day, so that the area does not close again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the membrane is thick, dense: then you must cut it with a wide scalpel, similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the blockage is made of flesh, then lift it with hooks, and cut it out: and you should have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without burning, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then insert a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly; she should keep it in for a few days.  And apply a dressing of dry linen; then continue the rest of the treatment until she is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes in the womb a growth of other flesh arises: it is therefore necessary that it be cut out in this way, as long as it is not a cancerous ulcer; for a cancerous ulcer that is in the womb should not be opposed with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Treatment of hemorrhoids, and red swellings and pustules in women's genitals.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the orifices of veins, until much blood flows from them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids become chronic, they become swellings: and I have already spoken in the division about their types, and their signs: and I will say here which of them are receptive to treatment, and which are not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the uterus, and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for it with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	However, those of them which are in the orifice of the uterus that are perceptible to the senses, are those which are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is necessary, therefore, that you place the woman in a cold room.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then stretch the swelling with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then sprinkle on them, at the flow of blood, one of the incisive powders without cauterization: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and things similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then let her press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, lower her into cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	But if the flow of blood persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate rinds, and oak galls, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the bleeding is stopped by this, it is good: and if not, apply cupping glasses to her back, and to her breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and submerge it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of plantain, or the juice of acorn branches, that is, acorns, in Pontus wine, and apply it to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, the abscess subsides, then treat the area with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of Alhaase, and is rough in appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary, therefore, that you incise what appears of it, in the same way that I explained regarding thelil: and treat it until it heals. 
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ On the perforation of a fistula which occurs in the uterus.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the uterus, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and pustules, and vesicles, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And indeed I have already described all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the section: it is necessary that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the uterus, when it is among the abscesses which collect pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with an instrument.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you must consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its throbbing, and burning, and fever: and you see it become red: if sensation is lost upon it, then do not rush to perforate it: and treat it with that which aids in its maturation, until the acuity of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you must have the woman sit on a seat between two benches, and recline, or be supported on her back, and draw her feet towards the lower part of her belly: and let her thighs be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage for that purpose.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the uterus is dilated.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	The form of which comes in those that follow.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you want to administer this instrument, that you determine with the probe the depth of the woman's uterus: so that what enters of the instrument is not more than the depth of the uterus, and injures the patient. 
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place small cushions on the lining of the uterine depth: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the uterus is prevented: and it is necessary that she place the screw, which runs in the instrument, on the upper side: and that she hold the instrument, and that the assistant turn the screw, until the depth of the uterus is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the afterbirth appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it near its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a tent submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the tent, and withdraw the probe into the depth of the uterus. 
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally on the uterus and on the pubis clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then let her be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until she is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the uterus and the wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of a lily, or long birthwort, has been boiled: then she should return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	But if the wound should be hidden inside in the uterus, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron; rather treat it with what we have described in the chapter.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	¶ Obstetrical Teachings, how living embryos, emerging according to an unnatural form, are treated. 
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter Seventy-six.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to first recognize the form of a natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman straining downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and what is upon her from the birth is relieved, and the exit of the embryo hastens: then you should know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is on its head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends on its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, what is beyond this birth, is unnatural, not praiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	Because sometimes the fetus comes out on its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one of its feet: or its head comes out and its hand: or it comes out prone: and perhaps it is turned on its neck, and similar things from the unpraiseworthy forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is necessary therefore for the obstetrician to be prudent, subtle in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and how the skill is in it, and it is explained thereby, and attention is paid to it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus comes out on its head in its natural way of coming out, and it becomes intense for the woman, and birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength now weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or have women hold her: and fumigate her vulva with boiled fenugreek, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert a small spatula between her fingers, and break the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her fingernail, until what is in it of moisture runs: and press the woman's abdomen, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If however it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her, after the enema, that she strain: and make her sneeze with mustard, and hold her mouth and her nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately. 
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if the two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you replace them gently and gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If however it does not obey in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward: then shake the seat on the ground: and let the woman be held, so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, therefore, the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut them off, and extract the rest of the fetus: and tie its hand with a cloth, and extract it evenly: for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards: then turn the fetus gradually: afterwards adjust it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When, therefore, they come out as far as the hips, then order her to push, and make her sneeze with pepper; for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with what we have described, then bring back the fetus gradually, until you place it according to the natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then come out with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	But if it is prevented after all that we have described: then take some mucilage of marshmallow, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound it all in a mortar with a good pounding: then smear with it the woman's vulva, and the lower part of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in lukewarm water, until it reaches her abdomen.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make for her a pessary of myrrh: and insert it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the pessary has been held for one hour, then have her sit on a birthing stool.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and squeeze her mouth and nose shut: and press the lower part of the belly with a gentle compression. 
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus onto the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it comes out in this manner, then the midwife will contrive in introducing her hands little by little. 
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman is laid on her back, and her feet hang down: and she lies on the bed, and clasps her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press on her abdomen little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then withdraw what is under her feet from the pillows, until she is positioned lower down.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	But if the fetus does not come out, then take her feet, and move them with a vigorous movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the hypochondria little by little, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he inserts his hands, and adjusts the fetus little by little: and he tells the woman to push until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	¶ Delivery of the fetus hanging sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It will be devised in the replacement of her hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	But if he cannot replace it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	But if she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs with a powerful shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	But if childbirth seizes her, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then diligently apply your hand in repositioning, and adjust the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself, until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus upon its neck, with hands outstretched, and its face is toward the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little, and adjust it gently.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When, therefore, it is adjusted, then place upon her vulva that which we have described of oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct her to move a little at a time.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When, therefore, you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and instruct her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct her to bear down: and make her sneeze with pepper.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the fetus positioned on its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this way with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of fluid.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If, therefore, it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not held back and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inwards, until you position it as it should be, and instruct the woman to bear down a few times: for it will come out with an easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The delivery of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five, indeed, is a thing beyond nature, and they do not live at all, and one afterbirth contains them, however many they may be, and they are separated by membranes, distinguishing between them tied in the umbilical cord of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they come forth just as a single fetus comes forth in a natural, easy delivery, and they come forth in a difficult delivery, as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	But if some of them are difficult during birth and they come to that which we have spoken of concerning unnatural presentations, then treat them as we have described, and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her do what she does with ease and slowness, and she will manage, according to each presentation, with that which is available to her, by her ingenuity leading to a successful outcome.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and are miscarried.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten, are formed in the womb: and it has already been confirmed by my observation that a woman, by miscarrying, expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which has been made by the measure of the glorious and wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	All this, therefore, is necessary for the knowledge of a midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps something similar to that will happen to her: therefore, she should oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I said in the section on medication, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to use a manual operation, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and not afflicted with any of the conditions from which her demise is feared, then the woman should be laid on her back upon a bed, with her head inclined downwards and her legs raised: and an assistant should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled off the bed during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the opening of the womb with moist oils, with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then insert it into the womb gently.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then with it she should seek the place on the fetus in which to fix the hooks, and suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Consider then, if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and below the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is feet first, then in the groin and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with her hand gently, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have mentioned, until it comes to empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fix opposite it another hook, or a third, if you need it: so that the traction is equal, and it does not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only straight, but rather let it be moved in every direction, so that its exit may be eased: just as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in the interval, that the stretching be softened. 
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	But if part of it is held back, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil and insert them alongside, so that she may turn out with them what is held back.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	Therefore, if part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks should be shifted to another, higher place: do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If, therefore, a hand comes out before anything else, and it is not possible to push it back, because of its confinement, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it until, when it comes out entirely, cut it either at the ankle joint, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you do with the other hand, and with both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction occurs at the exit, or water has collected in its head, then it is necessary that she insert a thorny spatula between the fingers and pierce the head with it, and extract the water: or break it up with the instrument that is called Almisdac: the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, she should do this if the fetus is naturally large-headed; then it is necessary to cut the jaw or pull it out with the misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then you should pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	But if the head emerges and is constricted at the collarbone, then it should be split until the fluid which is in the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it is not folded up and does not yield to exit, then cut the head piecemeal, as much as you can.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	But if the lower abdomen is abscessed, or there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until the fluid runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is uncomplicated.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped over your hand: and split the belly or chest until what is in them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore, if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand deep into the womb, and search with it for the head, and draw it with her fingers up to the mouth of the womb; then insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it out with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess which happens to it, then it is not necessary to work on it; rather, it is necessary then to administer a pouring of moist, oily things, and administer plasters, and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten. 
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it be straightened: then let what we said about the living fetus be administered. 
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	But if that is not possible, then let it be cut up piece by piece, and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you leave nothing of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which occur in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	But if a flow of blood should occur, then let her descend into styptic waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I indeed have now seen a woman, in whose womb a fetus had died: then she was impregnated over it another time, afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled up until it opened, and began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore I was called to her treatment, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore I placed over it one of the plasters of strong drawing power, and a bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	Therefore I marveled at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I therefore examined the wound, and extracted many bones, with the woman being in better condition, and now she has lived thus for a long time, and discharges a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I would not have recorded this strange thing here, except that there is knowledge in it, and help for that which a skilled physician administers with his hand in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	On the forms of instruments necessary for the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of a smoothing tool, with which books are flattened, which has two evenly placed screws at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, it is necessary that this screw be finer than the smoothing tool: and that it be made either from ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers: and the edge of both of them should be about one finger, and the length of each of them a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more: and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it is opened with them when you turn the two screws.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the screw with which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to that one, finer, and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition of them is about a handspan: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When, therefore, you want to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit upon a bed, with her feet hanging down, that which is between her legs opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined together into the womb: and you are holding the extremity of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you want from the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another scoop which the ancients called the Impeller, by which the fetus is expelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the Almisdac, by which a large head is crushed: and it is similar to forceps, which has teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made oblong, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of the Almisdac by which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of a hook having one point.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form of a hook having two points.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	Form of forceps which has teeth of a saw, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	Form of two spatulas, also broad.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied, and are prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the higher in esteem among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore you should not disregard any of these instruments, but have it prepared and at hand.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For the need of them is unavoidable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the extraction of the afterbirth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you must instruct the weak woman to hold her breath. 
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with spices: and press your hand over her mouth, and her nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If, therefore, it comes out by this means, that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and make a hole in the lid: and put in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and black cumin, and cassia bark, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and place them over a fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a tube of reed over the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the hollow of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	However, if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert it into the vulva, and search with it for the afterbirth.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she has found it, then she should grasp it, and draw it out little by little. 
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it is attached deep in the womb, then insert the hand, as we have described, until the afterbirth is found, and extract it little by little straightforwardly, so that the womb does not fall out with strong pulling: rather, it should be shifted easily to the right and left sides; then increased pulling force should be added.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it will then yield, and be preserved, and be freed from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already explained: treat it with sneezing, and by medicating the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire her out by repeatedly pulling.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Rather, what comes out of it to the mouth of the womb you should tie to the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then apply an enema to her with tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this will rot it after a few days, and it will dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it rots, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and this harms the weak woman.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered for this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Indeed, some of the ancients already tried fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the afterbirth and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of clay: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation material be placed on the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation material is consumed: and repeat with another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born whose anuses are not perforated, which a thin membrane has obstructed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	It is therefore necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger: and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp scalpel: and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it. 
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it may close up, then place in the opening a small tube of lead for many days, and let it be removed when the child wishes to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And indeed blockage of the anus also occurs from the healing of a wound, or of an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	It is necessary therefore that that healed tissue be cut, then treated with what we have said concerning the treatment and the lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a knotting and swelling that occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one of the parts: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that knot hardens, it is opened, and a watery white fluid, or thin pus, flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating fistulas are recognized by what comes out with excrement and flatulence, when the patient has a bowel movement: and perhaps worms come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And some of these fistulas, when they are deep, penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint, and to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	Moreover, how a penetrating fistula to the anus is distinguished from one that is not penetrating is that you insert your index finger into the anus: and you insert a thin probe of bronze, or iron, into the fistula: when there is no crookedness.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	But if there is crookedness in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe, or the hair, with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	But if you do not feel it deeply, and nothing of the excrement, nor flatulence, nor a worm, as I said, comes out of the opening, then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus, then the sign of it is the discharge of urine from it, and its prevention from closing up by means of medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it penetrates to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then the sign of it is that the probe reaches there, if there is no crookedness in it as far as the bone: and the finding of pain around the area, and that pus always comes out of it: and that medication is not effective on it, nor is it closed up with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and their treatment is labor and vanity for that one of the foolish physicians, upon whom it is practiced.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with the saw: according to what I describe to you, and I have already tested: and it is that the patient lies on his back in your hands: and raise his legs up above his thighs, and let his thighs be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then insert a probe of lead, or bronze, if there is crookedness in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, you feel in your finger the probe having now penetrated by itself exposed, except that you feel between your finger and it a membrane, or flesh: then you should know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not work on it, because there is no healing of it, as we have said. 
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they have said that in some men the flesh is healed, and from the medication by which help is hoped for it, that you should heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as preceded, and insert it, heated, into the fistula, until it reaches near the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice, or three times, until you know that now all those added, filtered, fleshy parts, which are like the quill of a bird's feather, have been burned. 
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those fleshy parts that have been burned come out: then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never healed by any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe comes out, and does not reach as far as your finger, which is in the anus, and there is a thick fleshy covering between it and the probe, or similar: and you see a fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go on cutting with the probe what is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered fleshy parts, which are like the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing of them remains.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, the blood overcomes you, and prevents you from performing your operation to cut those fleshy parts: then the best thing to be done, and the quickest relief, is to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cautery with fire combines good qualities, the burning of those additional fleshy parts, and the stopping of blood, and the drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with linen bandages soaked in butter, or crushed cabbage, until the place emits pus, and those burnt fleshy parts come out in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, generating hard flesh: and these are medicines in which there are styptic and drying qualities.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they are restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula now reaches to the depth of the anus, and is extended from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a tent, and between you and it there is a covering of peritoneum, or flesh, and it is close to penetrating: then there is no operation in that case, except by way of confidence and hope. 
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is, because one of three methods is administered in this case: either cauterize it, as we have said: or cut it until you reach its cavity, so that it is possible for you to insert pledgets, and the cure closely follows.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cutting, so that you do not incise the muscle containing the anus, and involuntary defecation happens to the patient.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	For perhaps it will heal: or peel away the covering, and clean it after you cut it up close to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe, or with another sharp-pointed instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse the filtered flesh which are in the incision, as far as you can by probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt restoration of the whole wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it closes: and the fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier for the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sewn in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a cobbler's needle, that is, of those who prepare hides, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread rolled up from five strands, and about that many.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its cavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If, therefore, it penetrates inside the margin of the anus nearby, then draw the thread out of that hole: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and draw out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tighten both, and leave it for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh parts which are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall off: then treat the wound until it closes and heals. 
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is available to you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you are not able to do it because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the pointed spatula with which the fistula is split, the curvature of which is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On suturing hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids exist in two forms.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For either they are inside the anus, like blisters from coals or like plums, or as if they are themselves like grapes.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of these, some are small and some large: and blood flows from them continuously, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus and on its edges.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, these which are outside the anus are for the most part with little moisture, from which runs yellow fluid, or a little blood with constant flow: and they have the color of flesh.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment for the one that is inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to strain: and push until the anus protrudes, and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore then, either suspend them with hooks or grasp them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a piece of folded wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle on them after the cutting some hot powders, so that they stand in place of cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was stated previously in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	But if the anus does not obey expulsion, then give the patient an enema in which there is a little irritant, so that it washes with that which is in the anus, and obeys expulsion quickly, when the patient strains.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their situation is mild, easy: and it is that you take them with your fingernail, or you take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shrinks from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer stitching of them according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wrapped thread and insert it into a needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be widthwise: and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong tightening.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then knot the thread and withdraw the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor sew it up, so that excess blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or oil of carrots, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur from dryness of the feces and constipation of the bowels.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become chronic, and medicine is of no avail in them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper layer of skin which prevents them from healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they heal as they should.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not heal, then repeat the procedure with stronger scraping than the first, until they bleed profusely and the skin is removed; then treat them until they are healthy.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil, and Formica.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round lump, the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs all over the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and pain from them occurs when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	It is therefore necessary that what is around the nail be cut, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and eradicated from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it: and if you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	Of the dry athelil, one is a small, rough, threadlike, round eminence on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is that you stretch the athelil, and cut it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with a hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it as described before with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now inverted and non-inverted athelil are eradicated with the instrument that I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A formica, however, is also a small, threadlike, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold finds it, something like the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs in the whole body: and most of them occur on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather: and place that small tube over the formica, so that the circle of the small tube contains its borders.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the small tube until you cut what is around the formica: and place it deep in the flesh, and root out the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with a small tube of bronze, or iron, according to this form. 
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the top of the small tube, tapering to a blunt, rounded point, be high so that the gripping and turning of it on the finger may be made easier.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what was stated previously about the cauterization of athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the forms of instruments that are used for clysters in diseases of the anus, and loosening of the bowels, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes a syringe is made from silver, or from brass, or from cast or hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those in whom they are employed.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is used in the treatment of small children should be small: and for those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too should their syringes be.
Clistere magnum.	Large syringe.
Cistere paruum.	Small syringe.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper end where the bladder is tied, should be wide in this manner: and let it have a distinction so that the bladder can be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very much so, tapering subtly: and on one of its sides let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the radii, and a little thicker, and let the bag into which medicines are placed be made from an animal bladder or from sheep parchment, which should be in the shape of a small waterskin: whose neck should be one palm [in length].
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be pierced with many holes as it is rolled up, and let the space that is between each hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes strong thread made of raw silk, which consists of ten threads, or about that many, and gather the bladder with it like a waterskin.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	Therefore, when the bladder is placed on it, let it be tightened on the head of the clyster between two separating bands with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer an enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of the bladder depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The way to administer an enema with it is this: fill the bladder or bag with the medication, warmed according to what the patient can tolerate: and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on his back and raise his legs upwards; and place underneath him an inthaan, that is, a hide on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the assistant should take the bag with both hands together, and squeeze it firmly until he has emptied all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then withdraw the clyster, and the patient should raise his legs against the wall. 
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	But if the medicine urges him to defecate, then he should hold it as long as he can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more beneficial in the extreme.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you give him a clyster in cases of diarrhea, and it is expelled quickly, then repeat the clyster until he is cured. 
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	But if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or harmful abscesses, then the clyster should be very thin, mild, of the sort given to children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the recipe for a thin clyster for chapped skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the section on the treatment of wounds what was appropriate for the book, and I will describe here their treatment manually and with medicines, in full.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds are classified according to that with which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things with which wounds are often made are such as the throwing of a stone, or the cut of a sword, or a knife, or a blow with a lance, or wood, or an arrow, and similar things, of which there are many.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	The wounds that occur according to the locations of the body are like a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar limbs among them.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am describing the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may establish that reasoning and rule regarding the other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, since the discussion of compound [wounds] will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and it has already broken only the skin: and the wound is large, and you fear for the sick person the outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately phlebotomize the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw blood from him according to the amount of his strength: if there is nothing preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of fullness, and wine, and gross foods. 
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prevents bloodletting, then let him be reduced in food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in it, cotton infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	But if you are safe from a hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then put certain ointments on it until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from the cut of a sword, and similar things: and its lips are not brought together by small compresses, then bring them together with a suture, according as I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their suturing. 
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound is already exposed from the bone, and hangs, and there is no holding it except in a small sling: then cut it off. 
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in it in place of skin, and instruct the patient that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away all the putrefaction, and discard it: then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate above the artery. 
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not cut, then cut it with a scalpel, or tie it off.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if necessity compels when what we have said is not effective, then cauterize it, until the blood flow is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small, simple, then their matter is easy, light: so that you sprinkle on them this powder: because it consolidates them before the air changes them. 
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The Method of Incarnating Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: let the whole be ground much, and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and clots with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then compress it from above with small cushions, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it is not dislodged.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present; it also performs the same function in many large wounds, when it is appropriate that it be placed on them and they be bound, and they are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered. 
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	But if the air has already altered them somewhat, especially when it is in the summer season, then the intention of placing this powder is not [appropriate]: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you place certain digestive ointments on them: or place on them poultices of barley flour, made with water and honey, until they emit pus. 
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then remove it with Gesti: and I will now discuss the treatment of fractures of the head in what is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Concerning wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment is avoided with that which causes strong astringency, like vitriol, and alum, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest of the limbs: and let that with which it is treated be mild from among medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when also washed with fresh water: and the other mineral stones, according to this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then administer a suture: or draw together its lips with small cushions.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs in it in its lower part, in which pus is now collected, then perforate it in the most depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	But if an artery has already been cut in the wound, and a flow of blood from it has followed: then separate, or cut it, and tie it off: or cauterize it, if necessity compels you to that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole, has already been cut, and the cervical arteries are safe, then join the lips of the skin with a suture over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat, rather level it, and bring it back to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then examine it: then if there are bone fragments in it, extract them all, or as many as you can: and what cannot be removed, leave it until the wound putrefies, and it separates and its exit is facilitated.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if bone is visible in the wound, and a fistula develops: then treat it with that which was mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Regarding a wound in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a piercing by a lance, or a knife: and you see its depth, then consider [it].
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, therefore, air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder in it at the first hour, nor bandage it tightly, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the patient: but put in it a drawing ointment, and loosen it twice a day. 
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have ointment at hand, then put old cotton in the opening of the wound, so that it absorbs the fluids that come out of it: and have the patient sleep on the wound, so that what collects in it will drain.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, three or more days have already passed since the wounding, and the patient does not experience spasms, nor a bad heart tremor, nor tightness in breathing, and you see his other dispositions are good: then know that the wound is safe. 
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with bandages and other treatment until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if its healing is delayed, and it is always open, then know that it has become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from the cut of a sword, or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or the back, then treat it with what was described previously concerning sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression in the bone, and pieces of it have been cut off, then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those pieces, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction will be easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment in the treatment of the remaining accidental wounds in the other limbs is the judgment of what we have said. 
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the protrusion of the intestine, and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which happens to the belly is large, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the large one, therefore, sometimes the intestine comes forth, or a number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their insertion is made, and their stitching more intense and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows, therefore, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hurry in their insertion to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and enlarged: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	On account of this, therefore, the middle rupture of ruptures becomes better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not made difficult, as it is made difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suturing of the penis is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are suitable in the suturing of the belly, and in the suturing of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly pertain to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Nevertheless they are more appropriate with the suturing of the belly: and I will describe each one to you with an explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say, therefore, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said: or because in the intestine there is swelling because of the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When, therefore, it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a damp cloth, in lukewarm water only.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil camel grass, and cyperus, and lavender, in water, and foment the intestine with it, until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine, in which there is astringency, does that: and it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling. 
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When, therefore, you see the swelling now resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that its return is made easier with little trouble.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if its return is hindered after this treatment, then make a small cut at the rupture, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than cutting: and there is no pressure to cut after the need and lack of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the thin end not be as thin as a spatula, but rather a little blunter: and this is the one that resembles a lancet, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When, therefore, the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that it be returned according to its natural form to its proper place, if that is possible: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then you must make the patient lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if the rupture is on one of the two sides of the belly, then direct your attention and your consideration always to this, that the part in which the wound is located be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you manage this in large wounds and in middling wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then ensure that a devout assistant is present between your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and brings together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it for him who follows, for the stitching, something after something: and this is the method of a single common stitch.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the amount of wideness of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then leave from the edge of the rupture the amount of a ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle besides which you insert into it thread at the two edges of the skin, with the two edges of the membrane which is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together the two edges of the skin, and the two edges of the membrane: and four layers are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with a double thread around the needle a few times from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound are joined together in a suitable union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then leave the width of a finger again, and fix in them another needle: afterwards thread it with thread, just as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease doing that with what you need of needles, until you complete the binding of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because very thin needles cut the flesh too quickly: and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin: because of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness, and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And the needle should not be inserted at the two very near edges of the skin: so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound opens before its closing, and they should not be elongated with the suture either, so that the wound is not prevented from closing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut off the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient during his sleep: and place pads of cloth on them on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles: and leave them until you know that the wound is now healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And indeed this type of stitching with needles is thus more suitable in small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since one needle, or two, or about that many, suffices for stitching them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second stitch however is common, that you join together with stitching the four edges: two edges of skin, and two edges of the peritoneum in one place, with a needle in which there is an evenly wrapped thread of equal fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, bring the needle back through the side from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the stitch is like the stitching of cloth with which cloths are fastened, and put between every stitch the width of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	And indeed men know this stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I myself sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was larger than a handspan: and about two handspans of the middle intestine had come out of his intestines, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I returned it after his intestine remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore the wound healed in a period of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, attending to his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a marvel, that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place in which neither ointment nor any medicines were found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and I continued washing it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will describe two particular types of suture according to the account of the discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When, therefore, the needle penetrates the skin and into the muscle going along the length and width of the entire body: release the end of the thread on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate at the other end from the inner part to the outer part at the other end of the wound.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When, therefore, you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate likewise at the same end of the wound from the outside to the inside: and release the end of the thread which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate at the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration which you make it penetrate into the thread at the end of the wound, which is on its side, until it penetrates it completely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also begin from this same side, and sew it with the end, which is of the thread on the other side, and draw the needle out from the skin which it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into that skin, and sew the end of the thread, which is on the other side, with this end of the wound: and draw it out from the skin which is on its side, and do that one time after another: and do that time after time, until you sew the whole outside according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the gist of this suture is that you sew with the suture of furriers with which they sew skins: so that you sew the thread one time on one side at the edge of the skin: and that you release it another time on the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second type of proper suture, which Galen described.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is his narrated speech, that you sew it according to the likeness with which certain healers sew them, so that they join every part to its matching corresponding part by nature: and apply the end of the thread to its other end, and the end of the wound to its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you fix the needle at the edge of the wound near you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that place only: and leave the two ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part into the two ends of the thread, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the wound, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitch, and it is the stitch previously mentioned.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is also the opinion of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The belly suture is repaired with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is, that you insert a single thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from the part that is near you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew hides evenly.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suturing is more difficult than that of other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The treatment of a wound, however, is the same as that of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is, that when you find a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it: and you replace the intestine, and sew it, and dress it: then you put on incarnative powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already altered the wound: then put on it some ointments, which are at hand, until they produce pus: and the threads fall out, and the tissues and membranes consolidate.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have medicines available, then put on it immediately, as soon as it begins to emit pus, old cotton: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medication in most cases, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members in the injury, then you should submerge soft wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas which are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	But if he feels pain, or pricking sensations, or putrefaction in his intestines (for that often happens) then give him an enema with warm, dark, astringent wine: especially if the putridity has already reached the intestine, and is about to break out, penetrating to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is easier to heal, and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine which is called the jejunum does not at all admit of healing from a wound which occurs in it; and that is because of the multitude of its veins and their size, and because of the thinness of its substance, and the closeness of its nature to that of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is omentum, and you come upon it fresh, replace it according to your method of reduction, by which you reduce intestines uniformly.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if some time has passed for it, and it has already become green or black, then you must tie it off with thread above the part of it that has blackened, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the omentum are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut off what is beyond that ligature, and place the two hanging ends of the thread from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that the pulling on it, and the drawing of it out in the event of sloughing of the omentum, and the discharge of pus from the wound, may be made easier for you.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A note concerning a wound which occurs in the intestine. 
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in some men: because I saw someone who had been wounded in his belly by being struck with a spear, and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic, and a fistula formed, and excrement and flatulence came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied treatment until I was certain of his healing: nor did I cease to attend carefully to it until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the patient that some bad accident would happen in his belly: and no bad accident happened to him from it.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in the best of health, eating and drinking, and having sexual intercourse, and entering the bath, and exercising himself in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some of the experienced have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is thus: that you take ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound and place one of the ants, having its jaws open, over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When, therefore, it bites onto it and clenches its jaws, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then replace it, and sew up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to sew up the intestine even with a thin thread: which is taken from the gut of an animal, attached to the needle after it is threaded.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And you should take the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove much of the flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie at its end a thin, wrapped linen thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then thread that gut thread onto the needle and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then return it into the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to a path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no skill except making it smaller, nor is its healing complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of headaches and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that every wound, or abscess when it becomes old and ages, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated, and always emits pus, and is not cut off: then it is universally called in whatever limb it may be, a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is according to truth a filtered knot, hard, white: with which there is no pain, which has the hollowness of a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And at certain times it is moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut off at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and it is little: and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I already stated in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer that is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of which is, either because of a lack of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it, and on its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much filth and dirt: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is sent to it is of poor quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of plague, or by a property in the region, as happens in Zaragoza: in which the digestion of illnesses becomes difficult, and the healing of abscesses by nature is slowed in it: or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For among them are Fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or peritoneum: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the joints formed by composition: such as the hand, and the foot: and among them are those that go to the vicinity of a principal member, and similar things.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, of these Fistulas, the one that is according to this manner, is among the illnesses difficult to heal, and it does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if there is any of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach these places that I have spoken of: and you hope, and you trust in its cure, and you want to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe made of bronze, or iron, if the Fistula extends in a straight line, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is tortuosity in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, due to the softness of its substance, is easily bent, and curves around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to investigate it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, inject an enema into one of its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the liquid with which you inject it will go toward the other openings and run out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire diligently in whatever way possible for you to learn whether a bone or nerve is there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow: or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and consider all of this with the greatest care, with your questioning of the patient, and by finding the pain upon compressing with your hand on the area, and by similar signs and causes pertaining to an abscess. 
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, you have considered all these things carefully, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and you should consider then, if the fistula is superficial and obvious, or in a safe place away from a joint, or a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you about: then cut open the fistula according to what I have explained previously, and remove what is in it from fluid and corrupted flesh that grows in its opening, or a fleshy growth, and such things: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is deep and straight, then you ought to cut it open as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply tents soaked in sharp medicines and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you reached with the instrument; do this repeatedly, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains of corruption in the cavity of the fistula.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of it, then locate it and cut it as I have described to you, if nothing prevents you such as a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If, therefore, bone is revealed to you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all of its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which causes it to form flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	But if it is not healed, and emits pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, expose it again, and carefully scrape and clean it with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then treat it again.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	So if it heals, that is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is deep in the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you have no choice but to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, extract it with fine forceps suitable for it. 
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then carefully extract them all, and do not leave any of them behind, with all your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if some of the fluids give you trouble, and there is no fear or risk of error in cutting them: then cut those fluids and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place on the wound something that will rot it: and leave it until what is around those bones, of flesh and fluids, rots.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And take care that the wound does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And the incision that you made in your operation should be constricted.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Rather, place on it, if you are concerned, a plug soaked in ground sulfur with oil: or a plug soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those fluids, namely, rot, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is made easier.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	But if it is a single large bone, such as the shin bone or the hip bone, and similar to them, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the last scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it entirely up to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you a case which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may consider it an example and aid in your work.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause that was stirred up within his body, that is, from the internal organs, until the matters reached the leg, and it abscessed with a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time passed with him with the error of the physicians, until the abscess opened, and much matter collected with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And its treatment was postponed, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus, and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skilled hand among them in the art, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matters which flowed from those openings in a great stream: also, the man's entire body was now wasted away, and his color was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them reaching each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I hastened, therefore, and cut over one of those openings, until I uncovered part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now corroded, and blackened, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated all the way to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore sawed what was revealed to me and prepared from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption, which I cut away and sawed off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines over a long period.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it did not heal.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed, and uncovered the bone a second time, beyond the first uncovering, and I found corruption continuous with the bone, and I sawed off what appeared to me also of that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore I uncovered it again, and I did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration, and it was not restored, until I cut away about one palm's width of bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed; and this repetition in its operation and its cutting was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his low tolerance, and my fear for him of death, since in every hour, because of excessive evacuation, he was affected by bad fainting spells.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore he was healed with a complete healing, and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and the condition of his body became good, and his strength returned, and he returned to his normal state, and the injury caused him no difficulty at all in walking. 
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, a protruding bone in a place of the body has already been fractured, then you must saw it, in this way: namely, you should take a cord and tie it at the end of the protruding bone, and tell someone to pull it upwards; and place another cord of wool, thicker than the first cord.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone, and extend its end so that you draw the flesh downwards, and you expose the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood, or a board, suitably under the bone below: because when you do this, it is not prevented from cutting the diseased flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And the sawing must be a little above the diseased place, so that the disease is not in the hollow of the bone and does not appear to the senses in its appearance, and forces another sawing in its place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	But if the bone is diseased, and is not protruding, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part, and the disease is in the middle of it, or in a part of it, then completely expose all the flesh from all sides.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards, saw it from the first side, where the disease is, until the sawing joins from the other side: and the sawing should be lengthwise, a little away from the disease, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	But if the disease is in the joint, cut the diseased joint itself, and saw the bone where it joins from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the disease is at the junction of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except scraping.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	But if the disease is in the back of the hand or the back of the foot, then the matter is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Truly it is necessary that you examine how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it, and clean it in whatever way possible for you, and with whatever means you can correct it: when neither a vein nor a nerve opposes you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many incisors and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their softness. 
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to prepare for each type of operation the instrument appropriate to that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long experience.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art [is] a guide to the types of diseases: for then you will find for yourself what is suitable from the instruments for every illness. 
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I will establish for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place [as] examples on which you will operate, and by testing which you will experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	The Shape of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The Shape of Another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The Shape of Another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The Shape of Another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This depicted shape of the saw, let it be properly made. 
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be made, its sharp edge of iron: and its handle of boxwood, and let it be pyramidal, suitably made.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The shape of a scraper for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this scraper be according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a scarifier. 
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable, except that the heads of joints be rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or the bone is broad and large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The shape of a larger scraper.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The shape of a medium scraper.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The shape of a broad scraper.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The shape of a scraper in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The shape of another slender scraper.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The shape of another scraper with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The shape of a small, slender, probing scraper.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The shape of a scraper with which bones are incised.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also the shape of a large scraper.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a spoke, and the end is like a saw: it is shown in many places from the scraping of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of a scraper which is suitable for the scraping of that which has been perforated from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its triangular end has sharp points.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of Indian steel.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly it is necessary that all things that we have mentioned be made of scrapers, and incisors, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an extrinsic cause or an intrinsic one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have treated that corruption with a cure of medicines, and the treatment is not effective: and you see the corruption encroaching upon the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that limb up to where the corruption follows, so that the patient may escape death through this, or from an evil which is greater than the loss of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign for the one to whom this happens, is that the limb blackens, until it seems that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness: until that putridness is incised up to that which follows that limb, and creeps into the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the bite of certain venomous creatures: such as a sea scorpion, and a viper, and a lizard, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If, therefore, the corruption, or bite, is at the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space for the corruption to proceed to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then incise it from the base of the forearm, and do not give space for the corruption, until it takes hold in the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption spreads beyond, and you see it around the elbow, then in that case is the death of the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer treatment beyond that, is [just] a question of how much strength [remains].
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And do likewise with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints: and if it takes hold in the instep of the foot, then incise the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it rises to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint. 
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy in it, except to stop treatment, and leave the patient to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of incising a limb, or sawing it, is that you tie a ligature below [the place] which you want to incise: and tie another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let an assistant stretch one ligature downwards: and let another assistant stretch the other ligature upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then let it be incised, or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw does not touch a healthy place: lest additional injury and a hot abscess befall the patient.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area, or place upon it some blood-stanching powders.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that this same incident that I am telling you happened to a man in his foot.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Which is, that blackness occurred in his foot, with a burning similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to encompass the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man himself hastened, after he saw the corruption attacking the limb with its vehemence, which he experienced from its pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to treat that excess with medicines which I placed on his hand after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and began to proceed into another finger, until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want to do it, hoping for myself to repel that excess: and I also feared death for him from the cutting off of his hand. 
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's constitution was prone to accidents/misfortunes.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After, therefore, he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and news reached me concerning him, that he hurried and cut off his entire hand: and was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not include this story, except that it might be helpful concerning that which occurs of this kind of disease: and that it might be a sign by which it is signified, and according to which one should act. 
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	¶ On the treatment of sinuses, and the method of administering enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members, and the duration of the abscess is prolonged, until it produces a collection of pus: then it ruptures, or is perforated, and what is in it of pus comes out, and an empty space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like cloth which has already been thinned: and it does not reach the deepest point in its corruption, nor does it penetrate to the bone, nor to a nerve, nor to a ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however if its duration is prolonged, until the corruption penetrates to one of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is, that you cut that whole skin as it rolls back: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you suspect that the skin adheres, and that ultimate consequence of corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness from flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and that is, that you administer it to the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then administer an enema to it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and verdigris, taking equal parts, they are combined in a vessel: and they are boiled over a fire, until the medicine reddens: and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take of it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and administer it as an enema to the sinus: and bind its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it by squeezing: do this for many days, until the sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is treated with an enema of ash-water, when this medication is not available to you: and it is done by taking the ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and you pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and administer it as an enema, until you are sure that the sinus has been washed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	But if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash-water, then administer an enema with water and honey, to which some crushed ginger has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or administer an enema to him with honey and wine mixed together, since it is a property of honey to cleanse and wash: and wine makes the sinus contract, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this several times, and you are sure that the putrefaction of the sinus has now been removed, then administer to him an enema with that which generates flesh in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And you should take some of the diafinicon plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or administer an enema with some other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	But if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that the enema cannula cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it some linen soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the orifice is too wide, then bring together its edges with a suture: and leave an opening of such a size that the enema can enter without difficulty. 
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if its opening, from which the pus flows, is elevated, then cut it in the lowest place on it, so that the pus flows down from there: because when the pus is held deep within the sinus, it prevents flesh from generating within.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus near its bottom as you wish, then endeavor to prepare the limb in such a way that the pus may flow out easily, as you deem suitable.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Endeavor that no pus at all be retained in it, and take consolidating medications that are put on the mark, suitable for that which you desire.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it makes contact with the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors, opposite the opening of the sinus, a hole a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it on top, positioned away from the opening of the sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is eased, and do not remove the large cloth except after a few days at a time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one that is over the opening of the sinus, this is the one that you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from the pus may come out, and so that you know whether the discharge that flows from it is much or little, or healthy or unhealthy. 
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this, again examine the location of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When therefore your treatment is extended in this way, and you see matter that comes out over the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus now adheres, or is close to adhering.  Then therefore loosen it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, then exchange for another cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a thin discharge comes out of the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, since there are some people who are slow in the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those of them who do the opposite of that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if unhealthy pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then increase the drying medications, but let the physicians make them so that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their potency: such as diaphinicon ointment, when an excess of burnt alum is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And one of the most extreme methods with which it is treated is that you take diaphinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and sprinkle upon it old wine, equal in quantity.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And honey does something similar to this action, when you do not have diaphinicon ointment at hand, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind it all up, and sprinkle it onto honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with honey that you have cooked until it has thickened: and sprinkle spices on it, and put a cloth over it, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long birthwort is administered in it, and roots of celestial lily, that is, lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them singly, or combined, grind them, and sift them: and sprinkle them onto the honey that I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the condition of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know, that there is corruption in its depth: or it now makes an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according as has been stated before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	¶ On the treatment of a whitlow and an injured nail, and the incision of an attached finger, and cutting.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore its condition is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes abscessed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it, with what we said in the section, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cut away with an instrument all the excess that remains of the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound afterward.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail now compress the flesh inward, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the corner of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upward: and cut that flesh easily, and put upon what remains of the flesh some of the burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, the corruption now penetrates into the bone, then it is necessary that you cut that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	But if you see the corrosion and corruption proceeding into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to what has been stated before.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, there occurs a bruise or a blow to the nail, and severe pain results, then it is necessary that you first phlebotomize the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse cut from above downward.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient, and it will cause the growth of extra flesh in the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the area with that which soothes pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	Now an extra finger which grows on the hands of some men, perhaps is entirely fleshy: and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it: and some of them grow at the base of a joint, or its growth is on some of the knuckles of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Thus, the one that grows on some knuckle of the finger does not move: and the one that grows near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the cutting of one of them that is fleshy is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you cut it at its root with a broad scalpel.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the treatment of one whose growth is at the base of a joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in the one that grows on a finger at the last knuckle, then it is necessary first to cut its flesh in a circular incision, right down to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The fusion, moreover, that happens to the fingers mutually, often happens either from the birth of a person, that is, he is born with it, or from the closing of a wound, or a burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	It is necessary, therefore, to cut that fusion, until the fingers return according to their natural form. 
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them lint, or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not fuse quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place is healed as it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if fusion happens with some fingers and the palm, then cut that fusion, according as it is prepared and suitable to the shape of the limb. 
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On the Incision of a Birthmark.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Birthmarks are convoluted, thick veins, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many limbs of the body: and their occurrence is mostly in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and laborers, and carriers.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is therefore necessary that you administer a purging of the body from black bile sometimes with a strong purge.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then bleed the patient's basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with iron, however, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein be lifted up, and extracted whole. 
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The cutting of it, however, is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, bathe the leg copiously with hot water, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision. 
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from the upper part, it is necessary for the bloodletter to have the patient at first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail with [something] down below: until a quantity of blood comes out which you see is sufficient and which the strength of the patient can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards bandage it: and order him to abstain from foods producing black bile: and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting, when the veins are full, and that harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The raising of it, however, is in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the patient's leg, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then place him in a bath: or bathe him on his leg with hot water, until it reddens, and the veins swell: or he should perform vigorous exercise, if a bath is not available to him, until the limb is warmed.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin lengthwise directly over the vein: either at its end near the knee or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and free the vein on all sides, until it appears to the senses: and at its appearance, you will see it tending from red towards black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When, therefore, it comes out of the skin, you will see it white as if it were a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert a probe under it until, when it is lifted and comes out of the skin, you suspend it with a blunt, smooth hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers away.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then free the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with the probes as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first. 
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need to.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift and cut it with a final incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then draw it out to the incision which is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you draw it out of the incision which is above, or higher than all the incisions, until it comes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not yield to you for drawing and lifting: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and draw it out: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand in every direction, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And take care that it not be cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm befalls the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, you have drawn it out completely: then place upon the site of the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the branch is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a convolution in parts, and it is not as we have said along a straight path: then it is necessary that you cut upon it in every part of its tortuosity and places of its convolution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift the whole of it: and beware when you cut on it lest you cut a vein or inflict a wound: for it will be difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, maintain your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Method of Cutting by which a Branch is Healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of a Blind Hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it sharp at the end, so that it does not wound a vein: and it has a thick curvature, smooth: because if it were slender, it would cut the vein with its slenderness: rather, let it have excess thickness, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of a leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein arises in the legs in hot countries, like Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, with little tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor trees grow. 
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it arises in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is indeed from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, just as snakes and roundworms occur within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the onset of the occurrence of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the area blisters.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal. 
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight should be from one qeel drachma up to two drachmas, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Therefore, as often as something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in lead, and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	But if it is greatly prolonged, then cut off a part of it and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it out by the root before the whole emerges.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess to occur, and decay in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be handled gently, and drawn out little by little, until it emerges completely, and none of it remains in the body; and indeed from this vein, there emerges in some men what is five palms and ten in its length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already come to my attention that one came out of a man twenty palms long.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it is cut during your treatment, then insert a probe into its opening, and perforate it with a long hole, along with the flesh, until everything that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the decay of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And indeed this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the ankle joint, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out of every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore treat it, as we have said in the section, and with what has been stated before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ On the incision over worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in a certain region among us bovine disease: because it often happens to cattle, and it is a single small worm, which is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it travels throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is perceptible by its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through a place in the skin, and comes out. 
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms and roundworms, in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its harmfulness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it travels in the body, and rises to the head, and arrives at the eye: then perhaps it opens into it, and comes out, and destroys the eye: and that happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When, therefore, you wish to treat it, and extract it, then that is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses. 
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	It is necessary, therefore, that you tie what is above it, and what is below it, with a ligature, tightly.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	But if it goes deep into the flesh, and you do not find it: then put a cautery with fire upon the place, until it dies. 
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greatest thing that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see that it has now arrived in the head near the eye, then tie below it the eyebrow with a good tightening.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person employ a cleansing of his body, with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods producing putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain which occurs in certain limbs: then it is transferred from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I indeed have now seen it, according to what I describe to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a sick woman in a certain village.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the rope-like muscle of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I stayed an hour, I saw a swelling proceed with a spark, as a worm proceeds, climbing to her shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it was like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I marveled at the speed of its movement from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I indeed had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who experience pain moving from limb to limb, and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is anything other than because the woman was one of those with a dry constitution, with visible veins: hence, therefore, that shifting flatulence appears to the senses. 
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it necessarily does not appear in this way in those who have a delicate constitution, and moist bodies, with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When, therefore, you wish to treat it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it appears visible to your eye, as we have said, then constrict above it, and quickly below it: and cut above it, until the constricted flatulence is released: and cauterize the area.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by shaking the body, and with that which expels flatulence, and soothes it with foul-smelling pills, and pills of serapin, and similar things. 
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are varied according to their types, and according to the places in the body into which they fall.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is indeed this: that some of them have large points, and small: and concave, and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And some of them have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And some of them have barbs.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And some of them have thin shafts.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, which are according to the limbs in which they fall, are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the parts are among the principal hollow organs, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When, therefore, it falls into one of these organs, and the signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear to you, then you must avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows the one in whom it is, in most cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound. 
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For among the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and passes out through the membrane which is over the brain, are: that there occur from it intense headache, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting of bile. 
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white moisture like porridge comes out from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And something resembling the wateriness of flesh comes out of it.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If, therefore, these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart are these: that it is near the left nipple, and it feels as if it is fixed in something hard, not in an empty space.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And coldness of the extremities, a cold sweat, and fainting follow it.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know, therefore, that death undoubtedly follows.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the discharge of foamy blood from the wound, and the vessels that follow the neck swell up, and the color of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales a great, deep breath, and seeks to draw in cold air. 
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	But if the arrow falls into the membrane that is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there arises a great shortness of breath with intense pain, with sighing; and all the parts of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps some undigested food comes out of the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed in it, some fecal matter, or a watery fluid, or intestine which is already ruptured comes out of the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore there is no hope in its treatment, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out, and some of it goes outside, and the pain on the patient is stronger, then know that it is mortal. 
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining limbs, however, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and upper arm, and vertebrae of the back, and clavicle, and hip, and leg, and those similar among the limbs are healed according to many arrangements: when the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may be informed about their treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is, that to a certain man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it for him from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye. 
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow for a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I reached nothing of it except its small end, with which it adheres to its wood: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with smooth iron, which does not have barbs.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no ill effect befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arab arrow, and that is the one that has barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore cut down upon it between the two collarbones: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I therefore proceeded carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After, therefore, thirty days had passed for him, and nothing in his condition had changed, I cut down upon the arrow: and I devised a plan concerning it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man in whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound closed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After, therefore, seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the base of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman in whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound closed over it, and the arrow remained within her: and none of her conditions changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound closed and remained, not causing him much pain: and many things similar to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the King's nobles, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already shifted a little to the right side: and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called to treat him three days after the arrow's impact.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore found the arrow wound very constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore probed it with a thin probe, and I did not feel it: and indeed, he himself felt a pricking and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that that pricking was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied a plaster to the area, one with drawing and digestive properties, trusting that the area would form an abscess and the sign of the arrow would appear to me so that I could cut over it: and no event happened in the area indicating that the arrow had reached the location.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore, I persisted with the plaster on him for many days, and nothing happened, and the wound healed in the meantime; and he remained ill from its extraction for a period of days, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore placed a sharp, corrosive medicine on that wound for many days until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt the thin end of the arrow which was stuck to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I continued applying that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound until the end of the arrow became visible to us: and a period of about four months elapsed for me with him.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound widened, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to refine and devise upon it with ingenious methods, until one day I began working on it with properly made forceps, according to the form of which will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I treated the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore, I restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient was healed with complete health; nor did it harm him at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take that as a rule and guide concerning what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood by narration: nor does a book encompass it, and the prudent practitioner compares the little to the much, and that which is present to that which is absent, and finds a new operation and a new instrument at the occurrence of unusual things in this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not come out of the limbs in which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either by pulling from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or from the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which comes out whence it entered, either it is an arrow lodged in a fleshy place: and it is drawn out, and comes forth.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	But if it does not readily come out at the time when it strikes: then it is necessary that you leave it for a few days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its extraction is eased, and its coming forth.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in a bone, and it does not yield to you for removal, then also leave it for a few days: and work at it with pulling and movement every day, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	But if it does not yield to you for removal after some days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a fine drill, until the [entry wound of the] arrow is widened. 
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and it has now penetrated into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms which I have mentioned appear in the patient: then abstain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until his condition stabilizes after some days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the meninges, then death is not far off for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and it does not penetrate as far as the meninges, and the patient remains [alive] for several days, and none of those symptoms occurs in him: then devise means of drawing and extracting the arrow.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is firmly fixed, and does not yield to you for pulling: then use a trepan around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the site, until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	However, if the arrow is now hidden within the body, and is concealed and hidden from the senses: then probe for it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot [get hold of] it, because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depths: and there is no bone there, nor nerve, nor vein: then cut over it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh stuck in them on all sides, by every means that you can, and [use] ingenuity if it cannot escape the flesh on the breaking of the barbs and twisting of them, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you manage the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use a twisting motion of your hand, with forceps, in all directions, until you make it come out: and [do it] extremely delicately, so that the arrow is not broken, and its pulling, and its extraction, made difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	But if you cannot manage it immediately, then leave it for a few days, until the parts around it putrefy.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try it again: for the flesh will be softened.  But if the flow of blood gives you trouble, then apply what we have described about treatment in its chapter: and guard your action against cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use ingenuity in every way that is possible for you for the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that, when you pull the arrow, the patient should be positioned according to the posture he was in when he was struck by the arrow.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if that is not possible for you, then use whatever positions are possible for you.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	Now, an arrow which comes out from the opposite side to the entry wound, either already projects somewhat outwards, or the end of the arrow makes a bump which can be felt above the adjacent skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut over it, and let the incision be of a size sufficient for forceps to grasp it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then draw it out, for it will come out easily.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	But if it is held fast in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow turns in the bone, and enlarges the hole for itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for a few days: then try again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	But if the shaft of the arrow is still on it, then push it through with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the shaft has fallen off, and you want to push it through, then insert a hollow instrument into it, so that its hollow part goes into the notch of the arrow: then push it through with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is hollow, then push it through with an instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is made easier to remove by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if this is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is near to what you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut down on it, then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or a nerve, and draw it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the ends be like a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grip the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many kinds are made of them, large, and small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow's largeness and smallness, and the width of the wound, and its narrowness. 
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The form of the concave pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the form of the blunt pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is of a blunt end like a spoke, so that its entry into the concave arrow is made easier, and it is pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing is made easier.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Concerning phlebotomy of the veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins to be phlebotomized, whose use has become customary in the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of which in the head are sixteen: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs: and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples: and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Lookers: and the prepared vein in the middle of the forehead: and the vein which is at the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins which are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins moreover which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is Cephalic, and is on the outer side: and the common people call it the head vein. 
Et Fusca.	And the dark one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And it is the middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilic, and is placed on the inner side: and is also called Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And the common people call it the belly vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the cord of the arm, and is located above the radius: and it is in this that one phlebotomizes, and it is that which appears above the thumb by manifest pulsation.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Salvatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is that which is beneath the curve of the big toe on the outside.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is the Saphenous vein: and its location is near the heel on the inside.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the sciatic vein: and its place is at the heel on the outside.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Phlebotomy of the two veins that are behind the ears is helpful for chronic catarrhs, and migraine, and scabies, and serious chronic ulcers of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the way to phlebotomize it is as I describe.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is thus: the head of the patient is shaved, and the back of his head, where the two veins are, is rubbed well with a rough cloth.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the patient should bind his neck with a band until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark there with ink.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a surgical lancet, which is the one called “Incision.”
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin using an incision stroke.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the width of two joined fingers, or about that: and let out as much blood as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then compress it with small cushions, and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And the incision of these, and their cauterization, has already been discussed at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	¶ Concerning phlebotomy of the two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples, is for chronic migraine, and severe headache, and persistent eye disease, and the flow of sharp, overflowing humors to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the way to phlebotomize them is according to what I tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	Let the patient tighten his neck a lot, until two veins appear, clearly visible to the senses: and their pulse becomes apparent beneath your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark them with ink.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet, cutting from below, and lift the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, just as you did with the two other veins: and let the blood flow according to the amount you need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then release the binding of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, place cotton and small cushions over it, and bind it tightly from above: and leave it until it heals. 
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And the description of them, and their incision, and their extraction has already been given at the beginning of the book. 
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	¶ On phlebotomy of the forehead vein after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for long-standing illnesses of the face: and for migraine, and redness, and foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	And the method of its phlebotomy is as I describe to you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	Let the patient bind his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	Then take the instrument which is called a lancet.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose form is this.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	Place the protruding point which is on the head of the lancet upon the vein itself, and strike upon it with the thumb, or with another thing in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then unbind the patient's incision and bandage it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a broad fleam.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary that the fleam have a sharp point, as other fleams do, but rather let it have a broad point.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And phlebotomize it transversely: because the bone is nearby: and perhaps the fleam will break in it when it is slender.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins in the two tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	The benefit, however, of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness, and a speck in the eye, and ailments of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	And the way to phlebotomize them is that the patient bind his neck with a band.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	Then phlebotomize them: and you should be standing over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	And the phlebotomy should be done somewhat across the length, with a small lancet, a little wide, for there is no flesh in the place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	For if the lancet is of a fine point, perhaps it will break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then let flow as much blood as is necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	And place cotton over them, and bandage them for one night, and then loosen them.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	¶ On phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	Phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and severe headache, and illnesses of the face, such as migraine, and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is long-standing.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the way to perform its phlebotomy is that the patient should bind his neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long lancet; and insert it in the middle of the cleft, between what divides the nose lengthwise.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you move your hand with the lancet a little, and let the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bandage it for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Guidegi veins.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	Indeed, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two Guidegi veins is for shortness of breath, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and malignant ulcers, and corroding, that is, spreading herpes.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	And the method of their phlebotomy is that the patient should tie a ligature under both in his neck: and the practitioner should stand above the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	Then bleed the vein somewhat widely lengthwise. 
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	Then draw out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	Then do likewise with the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards loosen the ligature and bandage the two veins with a moderate tightness: so that the patient is not choked.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins in the groin.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	Phlebotomy of the groin veins is beneficial because it helps with aphthous ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and malignant ulcers, and chapped lips, and malignant ulcers, also those that are in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the way to perform their phlebotomy is that you have the patient sit before you and tie a band around his neck.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Then turn back his lip, and look at the two veins: one of which is on the right of the lip, and the second on its left: and the indication of each is by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true: because around them are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, incise each with a lancet.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if you are in doubt, and do not know which of them it is, then aim to incise the larger and more evident of them.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed the custom is generally observed with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	¶ On phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for choking which is in the throat, and disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth. 
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the way to phlebotomize them is as follows: that the sick person sits between your hands facing the sun: and you lift his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on its other side for a vein: and the color of each tends toward blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Phlebotomize therefore each one: and take care not to reach your hand too far when phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries might occur.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow, moreover, are those in whose phlebotomy a custom has prevailed among all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle-leaf lancet: or an olive-shaped one, sloping to a point: or by incising with a knife-shaped lancet, and this is the Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus is the Alnesil, which is suitable for incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And among them are broad types, and narrow ones, according to the size of the veins and their tightness. The form of the myrtle lancet should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, visible, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this lancet is of lesser width and more delicate at the point.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of slender veins, which contain thin, clear blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	Phlebotomy of the Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	For it draws blood from ailments which are below the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest, and the belly: and it is fitting for the bloodletter when he performs phlebotomy on it, that he be cautious, and proceed with care, for beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, if he errs and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a hemorrhage will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, he ought not to phlebotomize it with a lancet: rather, let him incise it with a scalpel.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	But if the Basilic vein does not appear manifestly, then it is necessary that you leave it and turn to another, or seek some branch of it; or phlebotomize the median cubital vein in its place.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For that one is visible, and incise it with a scalpel, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to phlebotomize that same vein, then before the tightening of the arm, it is necessary that you touch the area until you recognize the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with ink, afterwards [constrict] the arm, and incise the vein with a concave incision using a scalpel, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that the incision does not fall near the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the bandage, a swelling in the place that you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	But if you see blood spurt during the phlebotomy, like a boy's urine, and the blood is thin and red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then hurry, and place your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is stopped (for it is often stopped) then bind the arm and leave it: and let the patient beware of moving it, and let him be without fear. 
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move it for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you. 
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends contract, and the blood flow is stopped.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of a pistachio tree, and split it: take one half, and tie it firmly over the place of the vein with a bandage and pads until the next day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then, if the bleeding stops, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not, then treat it with that which was mentioned before from the section on powders that stop the flow of blood: and stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases, because of the small size of the wound, and the possibility of bandaging from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Concerning phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The benefit of phlebotomy of the Basilic vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body: because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein, and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the bloodletter to be cautious about phlebotomizing it, for beneath it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he goes deeper in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some men, and is slender, and is not visible: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it, the incision with the lancet, and avoid the nerve with your skill. 
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	But if the vein is between two nerves, then open the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Concerning the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, moreover, is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and is advantageous for diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with a lancet shaped like an olive, or with a lancet shaped like a myrtle leaf: because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery nor nerve beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is proper for you during phlebotomy, that you avoid with the lancet the head of the muscle itself, and seek a smoother place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first incision, that it be repeated upon it with the lancet a few times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps an abscess forms in certain men when it is not phlebotomized on the first incision, but that abscess does not harm them at all.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	Now the character of phlebotomy, and its consequences from it, in whose correction you must consider.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	The first of it, therefore, is that which it is necessary for you to know, that phlebotomy is not administered, except for the preservation of health, and its continuation, and caution against the arrival of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And that phlebotomy should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and Median, and Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring, and summer: and in autumn, and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours of the day have passed. 
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy, however, which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when suitability and necessity call for it, at night, or day, and at every hour, and at every time. 
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And children should not be phlebotomized until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be phlebotomized, except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old men, who have already passed sixty years, be phlebotomized.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to be phlebotomized for whatever reason: it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema, if there is much retained feces in them: so that the veins do not draw from the intestines during phlebotomy putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, that is, sickening fullness, be phlebotomized: nor one who has overeaten, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that condition is removed from them. 
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor a patient with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And phlebotomy should be avoided again after an attack of colic, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse, and labor, and exercise, and sleeplessness, and fasting, and anything that weakens the strength from a bodily or animal cause. 
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the thinness of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him be exercised with some exercise, so that the blood may be thinned.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And perform his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and try to ensure that his chest is emptied that day of all bad animal occurrences: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and of all bodily occurrences, such as exertion, and pain, and excessive intercourse, and things like these.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let things be present in his place with the use of which the custom of men has run concerning aromatics, and fragrance, and rejoicing and things like these to the extent possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one to be bled: afterwards let him extend his arm, and let the bloodletter rub it with his hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tighten the bandage with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the tightening be moderate, because when the tightening is uneven, either through excessive tightening, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in looseness, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the tightening it is necessary that the person to be bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and are revealed to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the bloodletter wipe the lancet with a little old oil, specifically.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself a little below the place where he intends to make the incision, so that the vein does not escape and the striking goes astray.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For among veins there is one which you find like a fleeing chord at bloodletting: and among them is one which is full of wind: and when you place the lancet upon it, it contracts under the lancet, and the bloodletter is deceived, and the lancet does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is constricted: on account of this, therefore, it is necessary that the bloodletter be steadfast and attentive in all these matters. 
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he puts down the lancet.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	Therefore, if the vein is opened on one side, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it on the other side a little below that place, or above it, quickly, unless the place swells up.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it swells, or the patient is afraid, then leave him for a day, or two days, and he should not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will draw out a hot swelling.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And he should not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he may repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes. 
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that the amount of blood you want will not come out, then repeat the incision in the same hole along a straight line, and go a little deeper in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this quickly, before the place swells, for the place swells in many people with a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	Therefore if you see it already swollen, then do not repeat the operation on it at all, for it will not excuse anything for you. 
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put some oil dregs on it: because it eases the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly use oil dregs in all your phlebotomy, with which you open veins when the flow of blood is obstructed: and theriac al-faruq and sagapenum do this, when one of them is placed on the area.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if a large swelling occurs at the place of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to him who has not been bled except on that occasion, or the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little: and bind it for one hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has come out from the vein itself, when it is completed, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	But if some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put on it some dissolved aloe or myrrh: or some juice of horsemint, that is, calamint, or something similar. 
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And swellings and protuberances often occur near the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand on it, then if you find softness when you press upon it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Beware, therefore, of putting on it anything of what we have mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps arterial blood will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with something that has astringent properties, so that the area hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you draw blood from every man according to the strength of his constitution.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the prevailing color over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it reddens: and similarly if you see it thick, then let it flow until it thins: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, it is necessary that the opening of the vein be enlarged, and that the lancet be wide; and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that. 
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that you draw it in turns, and that the opening be narrow: and the best way to manage the opening of the vein is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from the flow of blood and from the cutting of a nerve, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And for someone who usually experiences fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eats a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice before bloodletting, or oxymel, if he has a fever: and you should draw blood from him in three or four turns.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in apple syrup, or in syrup of honey flavored with spices, or in fragrant, aromatized syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	But if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause of it is the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and a light, fragrant syrup: and that he use aromatics with civet, and that his chest be anointed with it: and that he use the other things that we mentioned in the section in the chapter on fainting from evacuation. 
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Now whoever wishes to open his arm and let his blood a second time—it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is on account of much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he let blood little by little according to the amount of his strength on successive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But whoever wishes to open his arm and let his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Now whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it tends, it is necessary that he be opened on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	But in whose body there is much blood already heated, and it is sharpened, and it causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood come out of him in one turn, and that a large quantity be drawn from him: and that the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting: and that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For this happens often, when the bloodletter is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not appropriate, when you wish to open the arm and let blood a second time, since the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon vehemently, and that what is bent be extended quickly. 
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very bad; rather leave it alone until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the lancet that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place on it some of the antidote *al-fārūq*, or *saǧzīnaj*, and apply a light compression until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the vein has already become swollen, then leave it alone, and do not cover it, until the swelling subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity compels the letting of blood a second time, and there is no other option, then either bleed it above that place, or on the other arm in another vein. 
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	The median cubital vein may be bled in the place of the cephalic and basilic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the way to bleed it is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be tied above it with a ligature, moderately tight.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then bleed it transversely, little by little, not across the width nor along the length: and the opening should be wide, and your bleeding should be a little way above the wrist joint.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	But if the flow of blood is stopped, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have drawn off the required amount.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if it is during the summer days, then you are excused from putting the hand back into warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And running the blood into warm water is most often done in winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And bleeding this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither a pulsating vein nor a nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Bleeding the Salvatella vein of the right hand, however, is beneficial for diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the way to bleed it is this: that you tighten the wrist of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you place it in warm water, until the vein swells and becomes very apparent to the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then bleed it transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm it in any way. 
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And take care not to extend your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the tendons of the fingers, bare of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return the hand to warm water and let the blood flow in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When, therefore, you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then put oil and salt upon the vein, so that it may not close quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly you should do with every constricted vein. 
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit, however, of its bloodletting from the left hand is that it is helpful for illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its bloodletting, just as you did in the second, equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit, however, of saphenous bloodletting, is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of the menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and chronic ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient should put his foot into warm water and rub it until the veins swell; and tie above the ankle joint with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the location of the veins is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and many branches branch out from it on the surface of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Bleed it, therefore, in its wider branch, or near the heel in its confluence, because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	But if you bleed it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your lancet, with which you bleed it, crosswise, as if you want to incise it: and let the lancet be pointed.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the flow of blood is impeded, then soak his foot in warm water and let the blood run into it until it is drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the bloodletter misses the vein the first time, then he should repeat with the lancet a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the outside.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And its benefit from bloodletting is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient enter the bath and hurry: and bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel by four fingers, with a thin long band: for it does not appear except because of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then bleed it according to whatever skill is possible for you, either by transverse incision, and it is better, or that you incise it with an incision, or cut it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all: then bleed some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and toward the little toe: and beware of the nerves, and let flow from the blood the quantity you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and place leather over the place of the bloodletting, and bind the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On Cupping, and the Method of its Use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping glasses are made from horns, and from bronze, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Either it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And cuppings which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are [in] fourteen locations of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is, the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are the two sides of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the face: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos upon the end of the tailbone: and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two legs: and the cuppings of the two ankles.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not draw blood for you from the small veins dispersed in the flesh, and because of that, strength does not diminish from them, as is the case from phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it appropriate to administer cupping either with fire, or without fire in any of the illnesses which arise from plethora, until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity compels cupping because of illness, or because of habit, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and whenever it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Which is because there are some people who, when blood increases in them until they need to have it drawn by cupping, experience heaviness in their head, and sodahan.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And there are some who experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And there are some who experience itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And there are some who scratch the place where they are cupped.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And there are some whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And there are some who find the taste of blood in their mouth, or their tongue swells up and they spit blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And there are some whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And there are some who see in their sleep blood and redness, and slain people, and wounds, and things similar to these.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of these signs, especially if it is in the third part of the month, then we prescribe phlebotomy, after two or three hours of the day have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit, moreover, of cupping the nape of the neck is this: that it helps with heaviness in the head and what flows to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But indeed it is necessary that this be after evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this cupping indeed is in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted for one of cold complexion to use it, nor for one in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And on account of that it is not necessary that old men use it, and those in whose head there are cold illnesses. 
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever becomes accustomed to it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And on account of that, it is necessary that you instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass for a little while to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Cupping, or Alkehel, is in place of the median cubital vein phlebotomy, and the basilic vein phlebotomy, and on account of that it is beneficial for asthma, and shortness of breath, and a rupture of the windpipe, and cough, and fullness. 
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping glass be applied for a short time, because if it is placed for too long, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Cupping, indeed alhagdahim, is beneficial for pains occurring in the head, and for eye inflammation, and migraine, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of basilic vein phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand with the scarification: so that he does not cut an artery, and a hemorrhage occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Cupping, moreover, under the chin, benefits thrush in the mouth, and infection of the gums, and illnesses similar to them which are in the mouth: and it takes the place of the phlebotomy of alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Cupping, moreover, of the shoulder blades, is beneficial for alchafacham, which arises from repletion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Cupping, indeed, of the inner parts of the two thighs, provides the benefit of phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilic, and Median Cubital, and Cephalic: because it draws blood from all those small veins, which are in the flesh: and those small veins draw from other veins thicker than them, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to proceed too deeply in the scarification: because the place is devoid of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	Cupping, moreover, which is performed on the coccyx, is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that the cup be large, and that it be made of brass: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps thin cups are broken: and let him scarify with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cuppings, moreover, of the legs diminish manifestly: because they draw blood from the whole body, and are beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, and womb, and bladder: they provoke menses, and are beneficial for buboes and elephantiasis: and they take the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the popliteal vein.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Nevertheless they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of cupping the popliteal vein is similar to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The proper way of placing the cups is that you first place the empty cup, and suck with moderate suction: and you do not prolong the placement of the cups, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with an even flow: and you do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the place now redden and swell, and the redness of the blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For whoever has tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cupper to broaden the scarification, and deepen it a little: and to moderate the suction with ease, and speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	But if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	Indeed, in the first time a way is opened for the thinning of the blood, and its wateriness: and in the second, indeed, for the careful examination of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	But if the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time: so that the end is achieved.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	But if we want the extraction of much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we judge that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification: and the proper limit in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What must be administered from oils at the placing of cupping glasses, and what the person being cupped should beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places to be cupped be anointed with opening, softening, dissolving oils: if it is in the summertime, such as oil of sesame, or violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or iris oil: and those similar to them.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	But if the superfluity is thick, cold: then let the oil be marjoram, or oil of balsam mint, or oil of mustard seed, or dill oil: and those similar to them.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If, however, the person to be cupped is of wide pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he be kept from oil, and it is necessary that they wash the places of their cupping glasses after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with nightshade water, or with cucumber water, or with purslane water: and those similar to them.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	However, let the one whose blood has much moisture wash the cupping glasses with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and those similar to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But let the one whose superfluities are thick wash his cupping glasses with old wine, or with elderflower water, or a decoction of dill, or of chamomile: and those similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in the bath, or immediately after the bath, rather it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is necessary for one who is about to be cupped or phlebotomized before cupping?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it, it is necessary that you consider first of all: then if the one who has been cupped or phlebotomized is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood: then it is necessary that he take cooling things, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and julep, and jujube: and those similar to them. 
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And offer for his foods chickens and the meat of yearling sheep, and foods seasoned with verjuice, and things similar to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink a syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be instructed to consume a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And include in his food chickens, and partridges, and sparrows, that is, small birds: and young pigeons roasted.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and phlebotomy be more than the food: and it is necessary that in the drink for some men, at times, be given theriac faruq, or a medicine of musk, that is, nutmeg, or alesselithe before cupping: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And they should not take it in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ Concerning Cupping without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Cuppings which are without scarification are cuppings that are placed over the liver, and spleen, and gout, and over the belly, navel, and the region of the kidneys, and the hip joint: since these members do not tolerate scarification upon them. 
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought for these except for drawing blood from one member to another: just as we place a cupping glass on the breasts in the case of a nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to release from a member cold, viscous wind: as when we place a cupping glass over the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it rarefies the member and warms it, and removes pain because it dissipates that wind.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed over the kidneys, when blockage or a stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by the power of its suction, perhaps it opens the blockage or pulls the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And it acts similarly when placed over the liver and spleen for the purpose of grinding up wind in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with scarification only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in cases of pleurisy: and that is so that the cupping glass, a large one, is filled with plain hot water, or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The method of cupping administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two spread fingers, according to what we have described: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be on its side, at a point about halfway down, a small hole, the size of which a needle could enter: let it be made from thick, smooth, even, polished bronze or brass: so that it does not injure the limb when it is placed upon it: and let there be in the middle of it a transverse rod of bronze or iron, where a lit candle is placed. 
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we have described, and a little smaller than that, depending on the illnesses and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the cupping glasses of children, and thin people are different than the cupping glasses of men, and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The way to place this cupping glass with fire on a limb is as follows: light a wick of linen properly with fire, or a small wax candle: and place it on the middle of the transverse rod that is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the lit fire is near the lower part of the cupping glass, so as not to burn the patient's body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it should be placed upon the limb: and a finger should be over the hole which I mentioned, as long as we are holding the cupping glass: when we need to, we remove the finger, and the vapor will escape through that hole, and the cupping glass will immediately release. 
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then ignite the wick according to its proper method, and repeat this if you need to.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	The cupping glass, however, which is used in cases of pleurisy, with water, does not have a transverse rod, nor a hole: and it is only used by filling it with water, and placing it on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this cupping glass, the larger it is, so that it may hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ On the application of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not administered in many places, except in those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their smallness, such as the lip, and the gum, and similar things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb denuded of flesh, like a finger, and a nose, and similar things.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the way to use them is this: that you should obtain leeches which are in fresh waters, free from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be left for a day and a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their belly.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should first be evacuated with phlebotomy, and with cupping glasses.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wipe the limb of the patient until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterwards, they should be placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and they fall, and suction of the place with a cupping glass is possible, then it is most effective in aid: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it should be rubbed, and squeezed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	But if the flow of blood continues after the fall of the bloodsuckers, and it does so by oozing: then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the oozing is stopped.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the blood increases, then sprinkle on it ground alum, or gallnuts, and similar styptics: until the blood is stopped.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or peeled halves of beans may be placed over the area: and left until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if repetition of the bloodsuckers is required, when possible, to change them. 
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then the area should be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or stick a needle in places until some of the blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be placed, for when they sense some blood, they adhere immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When, therefore, you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some ground aloe, or salt, or ash: and they will fall off immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	The End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	The Third Part of Albucasis's Book of Surgery.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A general discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of medicine, and it concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones. 
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that foolish physicians and common people, and those who have never looked into a book of the ancients, nor read a letter of it, boast about this chapter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it happens that this method from among the sciences is unknown in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never encountered anything good at all in it, and I did not obtain from it what I obtained except through long reading of ancient books, and study upon their understanding, until I extracted its knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experience and study for the duration of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described for you in this chapter all that my knowledge contains: and upon which my experience has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the work of prolongation, and shortened it with the utmost brevity, and shown it without digression: and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments which are used in it, with the addition of digression, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections on the nature of bone fractures, of those whose premise is necessary, before we begin the discussion of fractured limbs, and the different [types] of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter, the main points of the discussion, and the headings, to whose understanding the practitioner is first compelled for establishing their truth: namely so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or sprain, or fall happens to someone: then it is necessary that you hasten first to phlebotomize him, and loosen him, or both together: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength: or the one to whom something of these has happened is a boy, or a decrepit old man: or it is a time of intense heat, or very intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content in his food with cold vegetables, and the meat of birds and goats, and avoid wine and rich meats, and being filled with foods and any food that fills the veins with blood. 
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until, when you are safe from a hot abscess, and you do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the patient return to his first regimen with which his habit has run.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the patient be nourished with very nourishing, rich, heavy foods, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and things like these.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better. 
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they be joined and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their limbs: and those of them that are at the extreme of softness, like the bones of small children, are consolidated and joined.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Nevertheless, nature attaches over the broken bone from every side something like glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together, and tied together, until it comes to the point of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its functions: and for this reason it is necessary that you place as the patient's nourishment foods in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said. 
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull: and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of a vertebra: and similarly all the other limbs differ from each other: and I will come with a description of every type of fracture explained in its own Chapter distinct from the other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fracture are also diverse in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Since its fracture may be curved, besides splinters occurring in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and there are pointed fractures of it, that is, splinters, and protruding additions, just as they are in a reed when it is prepared with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not protruding: and there is a fracture with a wound and a break in the head: and there is a fracture, a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each type has a specific character, or instrument for its restoration, according to what will be recalled about it, distinguished in its own place.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this the fracture of the bone is recognized, its crookedness and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When, therefore, there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor sound at your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the patient feel great pain: then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there may be crookedness, or a small fissure: therefore you should not move it at all with your hand and pressure, but instead put on it some of the medicines, which will be mentioned, after the appropriate time for the place: then it should be bound with a tight bandage. 
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place is bent and split in two, besides the fact that inflammations occur in it, nevertheless every part is moved from its counterpart: then you must begin immediately to straighten it, making it even before a hot abscess develops.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot abscess develops, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then straighten it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and straightening are easier than in a bone in which fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it as you see fit.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from both sides, if it is a hand, or a foot: either with your hand, if the limb is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb on a level place, according to its natural shape, until the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then endeavor to restore those fractured parts with all skill, and in any way you can to their places: and beware according to your strength, lest pain or injury befall the weak person through your work: and endeavor according to your strength to join one of the two bones with its companion, in the best possible manner.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And at that time it is necessary that you test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If, therefore, you see anything amiss there, correct it, and adjust it according to your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of forceful extension, and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often cause by their procedure a hot abscess, or contraction in the limb, as we have seen often from their work.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after the setting and proper procedure and bandaging of that limb, connect rest and quiet, and advise the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him take care not to move it during his waking hours and his sleep, in turning and moving, and when relieving himself, and in all his movements with the utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And let him beware lest the position of the limb be a position which causes pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is because, when he feels pain or injury from the position of the limb, then it is necessary to change it to another position that does not cause pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him, so that his position is even and straight, so that crookedness may not occur in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the manner of binding a fractured limb is as I describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs differ in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them which are small, such as the arm, and finger, and radius, and similar to them, then it is necessary that the wrapping of soft, thin cloth be used.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Those of them which are thick, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that a wide, hard wrapping be used on them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a wide bandage connects a large limb and binds it on all sides with an even tightness, so that no spot is missed.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin, after your evacuation, with the setting, to place a suitable ointment on soft tow over the place of the fracture itself. 
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the fracture itself with three or four turns, according to what the limb requires, and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with it to the part above the place of the fracture, and tighten less than your tightening with which you tightened the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then move away with the wrapping from the place of the fracture a little, and gradually soften the tightening until you take in a large part of the healthy area.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the fractured place with turns.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards, go with the bandaging to the part below the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your work in the tightening of the bandaging, and its loosening, be according to what we said about the first upper bandaging.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the bandages some soft tow, or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture is leveled, if there is crookedness in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another bandage over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then neatly arrange suitably made splints over these bandages immediately, if there is no swelling in the area, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is swelling in it, or an abscess: then put on it something that settles that abscess and removes the swelling: and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then at that time tighten the splints over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the splints should be from halves of a broad reed, smoothed, skillfully shaped: or they should be from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or palm branches, or reeds: and let the width of every splint be according to this form, and this same shape. 
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be a little thicker and wider than the other splints: and the length of the splint should be according to what is allowed by the limb in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten over the splints with another bandage, in the same way as the first bandaging.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie over it neatly with threads, according to what we have said about the bandaging: and it is so that your bandaging is more over the place of the fracture: and the further it is extended from the fracture, the less the bandaging.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the work of fools placing their threads from twisted cords of linen, it is a great error: because the bandaging turns out improperly with them. 
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads again are not suitable: because you will not achieve through the bandaging with them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not appropriate that there be less than a finger's breadth between splint and splint.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	But if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after bandaging in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow, or carded wool, until he is not injured at all by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a laceration happens in the skin, I will come to the discussion of it in the second chapter individually.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb should be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Because, when the limb is large, it is not appropriate to place splints on it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your certainty about the outcome of a hot abscess. 
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, which the ancients restored, which are placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	¶ The method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children: because it is of a kind not overcome by heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the marrow of the flour hanging on the walls of the mill from the motion of the millstone, and prepare it as it is, except that you sift it with egg white; and make the mixture neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	¶ The method of another plaster, restoring a fracture, and dislocation, and sprain.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almese, and laudanum, and acacia, and elecampane, and mugwort: and the juice, of each ten drams; myrrh, and aloes, of both five drams each; and wild carrot twenty drams; let all be ground, and sifted, and mixed with wild carrot water: or with egg white, if the patient's complexion is heated. 
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and is suitable for many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	¶ The method of another plaster, which is also suitable for fracture and sprain.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mugwort, and mastich, and white marshmallow, of each ten drams; myrrh, and aloes, of both five drams each; acacia six drams; Armenian bole twenty drams; let all be ground very finely, and sifted, and prepared with water, or egg white: and let them be administered.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	¶ The method of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain affecting them, and the splitting of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take greasy wool, and soak it in vinegar and boiled oil: and place it over the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster, indeed, there is no power of restoration, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess: and it properly expels pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	¶ The method of a plaster which restores a fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of the deaf fig and leaves of the wild poppy, and grind them all up, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	¶ The method of a shortened plaster, administered for the restoration of a bone fracture: and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take root of marshmallow, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and grass meal, one part of each: let all be ground, and prepared with wine, if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if it is heated, then prepare it with the water of fresh coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	¶ The method of another plaster, stronger in resolution than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take marshmallow root, and linseed, and pomegranate rind, and melilot, and elderflower, and violet flower, and chamomile, one part of each, let all be ground, and prepared with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of this according to the heat of the limb, and the subsiding of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, except a cerate made of wax and oil: nothing else: and he explained that it should be medium between thickness and thinness. 
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	It seemed to Galen, however, that things which dry out heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and things similar to them from among those which we have mentioned, should be placed upon the fractured limb during its restoration.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The Method of a Plaster Which Benefits Injury and Pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take equal parts of gum acacia, chickpeas, cut human hair, or bird feathers, marshmallow, and salt: let them be ground, sifted, and mixed: and let a plaster be made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The length of time it should remain bandaged, before being loosened, is such that you should then consider if the patient experiences no pain, nor itching, nor is the fractured bone moved from its place: then you should not unbind it for many days. 
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if there occurs in that place intense itching, or troubling pain, or swelling, then hurry and unbind it immediately, and remove the plaster from it, and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, wet it, and soak it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain is soothed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then allow the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it clipped wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight, until you are sure of no hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then return to a light bandaging and a small plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as your first bandaging, and continue with light bandages until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	But if you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the symptoms are now completely gone, and you need a plaster and bandaging, then repeat it just as you did in the beginning, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	But if none of the things we have mentioned happen to the limb, then do not unwrap it for three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And sometimes it is left for a full twenty days, according to what you see from the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh grows over it: then tighten the bandaging more than your first bandaging: and also increase the richness of the patient's food, as was mentioned before.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see the site of the fracture drying out and becoming thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore bathe it with warm water every time you unwrap it, and do this for three days, and loosen the bandaging a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this procedure, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	What foolish bone-setters do, setting a limb a second time when it was not properly set the first time, and setting it crookedly, is an error in their practice, and a great danger: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said so in their books and would have practiced it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have nowhere seen any trace of them doing so at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning a fracture occurring in the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fracture are diverse, and its forms are many: and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture which is made by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the entire bone until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and for that reason this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts some of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to its deepest part: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a scraping away, absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large, or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a crushing or a grinding: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the membrane, which is under the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone with the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Hairline.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And among them is a fracture, which is made by a fall, or a blow from a stone, and similar things, which cause the layer of bone to go inwards, and a concavity is made in the place: as happens to copper kettles, when a blow strikes them, and part of them goes inwards.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed this happens most often in the heads with moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And for all these types of fractures, separate techniques are employed, and I will come with a complete account of that in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures by examining over it, and investigating them with probes, and removing the corrupted flesh which is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	But the hairline type is recognized by this, that it is uncovered over the bone, and it is cleaned, and ink is smeared over it: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms that they clearly indicate grounds for fear, such as vomiting of bile, and stretching, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and fainting, and high fever, and bulging of the eyes, and redness of them, and things like these among the symptoms in many cases, without doubt he will not be healed: and if you see that the symptoms do not frighten you, and you hope for recovery, then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	Which is, if a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded: and that is in the winter days, then it is necessary that you endeavor to remove the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from the membrane is corrupted, and those symptoms that we have described occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	But if the fracture of the bone now reaches the membrane touching the brain, and it is with small pieces, and pulling: then it is necessary that you cut out the comminuted and damaged part, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, that you shave the head of the wounded man: and expose it over the bone in whatever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	But if there happens to you during the exposure of the bone a flow of blood, or a hot abscess: then treat it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and you allow the wound to rest, until the abscess settles, and you are safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is that you cut the bone with a sharp-edged incisor: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then manage another incisor after the incisors a little wider than it: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also manage another incisor even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you have a number of different incisors: some of which are wider than others, and some of them shorter than others: and let them be at the utmost sharpness of their extremities, and let them be of Indian steel, or steel: and use gentleness in striking upon the incisor, so that it does not shake the head, and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is strong, hard: then it is necessary that you perforate around its circumference, before you manage the incisors, with drills which are called non-penetrating drills: and they are not so named except because they do not pass the limit of the fleshy bone to that which is behind it: because the drill has a round extremity above that which is under its sharp head, like a margin, and a small circle prevents it from being submerged, and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a large number, each of which corresponds to the size of the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull: whose sharp extremity's size in length and shortness is according to the size of the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	But the method of perforating around the fractured bone is this: that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and put between each hole a space the size of a radius' thickness, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with chisels what is between each hole of the bone: and make it thinner, as much as you can, over that end with lightness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand, or with any other of certain instruments, which you have prepared for that: such as forceps and fine scissors. 
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you take every precaution so that the drill, or chisel, does not touch any of the meninges.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When, therefore, you have gone around the bone by drilling, and it has been separated from the meninges, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth the end of that which remains in the bone with another instrument similar to a chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thin and finer than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	But if any small bones and fragments remain, then remove them easily, with whatever instruments you have at hand.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound afterwards with bandages and ointments that we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, completely free from danger, which Galen described and greatly praised: and this is his account.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin to expose the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and more evident: until you expose that part and place beneath it the tip of this lenticular chisel, whose form is this.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular, smooth part does not cut anything: and its sharp part on its two sides going lengthwise, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests on the membrane, its sharp face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike upon the chisel on one side with a small mallet, until you cut the whole bone easily, as it turns: and you will be certain about the membrane, that no accident will happen to it that you would fear at all.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not the most foolish of men, and the most ignorant of it, nor were sleeping, then if any part of the membrane should remain attached to the bone in some places, he would cut it away from it with the tip of the same lenticular chisel, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it: then it is necessary that you scrape that roughness, and eradicate those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of various sizes, so that it is possible for you to use from them in every place the more suitable of them, and the most appropriate of them, according to what the operation leads you to, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you employ in your scraping, with which you first scrape the bone, the widest of those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this continuously, until you come to using the thinnest and finest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small hair-like fissures, and in a fine fracture, you must administer care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter which is not hidden from anyone who has any interest in this art, and who has considered what we have written and shown concerning large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if exposed membrane is retained when you scrape the bone, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, folded double or triple, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as gently as you can on it, so that the patient is not burdened.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a wide bandage over it: and do not tighten it, except to the extent that it only holds the wound: and leave it with this treatment for one day, or two days, until you are safe from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and afterwards apply medicines with which there is superfluous dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and things similar to them: and you should make a powder from these medicines, which is sprinkled on the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And generally apply to it every medicine whose property is to cleanse and not bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean: and that there be no dirt of ointment nor filth in it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not allow any pus to collect in it at all: because when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it, and makes it putrefy, and after that a great harm befalls the patient: and now it happens in the skull sutures, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Consider therefore then, if the accidents which we have mentioned happen to the patient, know that it is undoubtedly pernicious.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness does not occur, unless from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and smear the cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on the suture: afterwards treat it with the types of treatments which are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter 4.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that of the nose, only its upper two parts are broken together, or one of them: because they are two bones: since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and nothing happens to it except abrasion, and twisting, and crookedness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into the opening of the nose and adjust that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and let this be done skillfully, with ease. 
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware lest pain happen to the patient from your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it: then it is necessary that it be adjusted with the end of a probe, which should be of small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	But if the fracture is in both parts, then do the same thing: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the cessation of hot swelling.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a tent of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two tents if the fracture is in two parts: and let the tent be of such a thickness that it fills the opening of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient surgeons said that the tents should be soaked in butter, and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That, however, does not seem right to me; rather, the tent should be soaked in egg white, mixed with miller's dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the tent until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of a tent, after a soft cloth is wrapped around it: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, make tents.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	But if a hot abscess happens to the nose again while you are operating, plaster the nose with spurge, or with quince infused in rose oil, or with a little diachylon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and frankincense powder prepared with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft tow on it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture, or are shattered, then it is necessary that you cut over them and extract them with instruments suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the incision, and treat it with that which promotes flesh growth and strengthens from plasters suitable for it, or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if a wound occurs within the nose, then it is necessary that you treat it with tents and administer a small lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter 5
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not with a wound: then examine if its fracture is only external, and not broken in two, and curved inwards: then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	It is necessary, therefore, if its fracture is on the right side, that you insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth: similarly if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the hump of the fracture gently from the inside to the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone fittingly, and with it level it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	But if the fracture of the jaw is already separated in two, then it is necessary that you perform extension from both sides, according to straightness: until its setting is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, shaking or disruption has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those you hope will remain with a thread of gold, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place cerate over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a folded cloth over it, and place over the cloth a large, properly made splint: or a piece of shoe leather of equal size, the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bandage it from above, according to how its bandaging is prepared for you, and its application is suitable, until it is not dislodged: and order the patient to use tranquility and rest: and make his food mild sips.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you judge that the shape has changed in some way, then hurry and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been altered, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cerate: and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	Therefore, while that plaster remains attached to it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it alone, do not loosen it, until it is healed: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is very often tightened in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	But if in the meantime a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often described for reducing it, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	For if a fragment is already separated from the bone, or from an arrowhead, then be meticulous in this, so that you remove those fragments of the arrowhead with that which is suitable for you in removing them from the instruments. 
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed those arrowheads, and nothing of them remains, sew then the opening of the wound, if it is large: and if not, place upon it from among the plasters which are suitable for it, and cause it to heal, until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	On the restoration of the Clavicle, when it is fractured.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The Clavicle is very often broken from the front part on the side of the shoulder, and its fracture occurs according to one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For either it is broken and separated in two, besides which punctures occur in it: and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, that punctures happen in the bone: and this is more difficult for restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, that there is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the procedure on it when the fracture is without a wound, is that you make two assistants present, so that one of them holds a support which follows the broken Clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then align the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary: and let there be in it neither a protrusion nor a depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	But if you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's armpit a ball of cloth, or wool: and let its size be according to the amount of your need: and extend, and elevate the Clavicle, and compress the ball with your hand, until you align the fracture, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	But if you cannot draw the end of the Clavicle outwards: because it has gone deep: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back on his neck: and you place under his shoulder a cushion, middling in size, and let the assistant press his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the Clavicle which is deep is raised upwards: and then straighten the fracture, and align it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a splinter of bone from the Clavicle, and it moves: then it is necessary that you cut down upon it, and extract the splinter with care.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If, however, it is retained in the bone, then contrive its incision with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the Clavicle the instrument that protects the membrane: and it is an instrument of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon without a bowl.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to what you need of it from the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And let it have two ends, as you see: and let one end be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	But if the tearing of the wound that you cut when you extracted the fractured bone is wide, and you are safe from a hot abscess, then join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the tear is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and cushions according to the size of the cut of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A fracture of the bone, however, when it is without a wound and without a cut, is that you should place over the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft tow over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under his armpit if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a *himamatem*, that is, a wheel that the Saracens hold, which should be very long, and its width should be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled cushion over the tow and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width should be three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the splint on the place of the *alhimatem* which falls over the fracture and the area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the *alhimatem* over the fracture as it is rolled, and wrap it over his neck, and under his sound armpit, and under his injured armpit: and bring it back over every part, and how you see that the bandaging holds the fracture with a proper tightness: and that is what is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that the splint is not moved from over the fractured bone. 
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And on account of this it is necessary that you examine the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, as often as the bandage loosens and you see the splint now moved: then adjust it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient to sleep on his back, and put a small cushion under his armpit next to his bed at night, so that with it his shoulder may be elevated on his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the bandage, unless something occurs in the place from itching, or from an abscess, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface needs it. 
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And tighten the bandaging, and leave him until it is restored and healed.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed a fracture of the clavicle is usually consolidated and strengthened in twenty-eight days: and sometimes in certain men in less than that. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Regarding the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder blade is rarely broken, and in its broad area; and only its edges are broken. 
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When, therefore, a place in it is fractured, and it is fractured in its middle, and that is not recognized except by touch: then, according to what the form of the fracture is, attempt its treatment.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And bring it back to its natural shape in every ingenious way that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the area mill dust with egg white, and soft tow, and place over it a small cushion made of folded cloth. 
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place upon it a broad splint made of thin wood according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or a little larger than it.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if there is a concavity beneath the splint in any place of the shoulder blade, then level that concavity with soft tow, until the splint settles evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bandage over it with long, moderately tight, and firm bandages, until it does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And check the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Therefore, whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it moves from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the shoulder blade is indeed restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When, therefore, this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and you may be without worry. 
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is among the bones whose joining is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if a fragment projects from the bone, and pricks under the skin, then cut down upon it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we have described in the fracture of the clavicle concerning the calming of a hot abscess, if something of that sort should happen.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone is sometimes broken in its middle, and that happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Indeed, its extremities are most often broken, and shattered from accidents affecting it. 
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle, which slopes toward the lower parts, is broken, and severe pain happens to it, and difficulty in breathing, and a cough: and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity is evident in the broken bone, and is not hidden from the senses, its restoration is as follows: that the sick person be laid on his back: and place a cushion between his shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with the hands: and be subtle in setting it, in every way that is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone returns, as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and padding over it, and place over it a splint of a thin board of willow, or of tin, and similar light materials, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then take care in binding it over the broken bone, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it with a moderate tightness.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandaging at every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if necessity compels its loosening due to itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or an abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with the appropriate method of treating it.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reapply the plaster, if you see a need for it: and apply the bandaging to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ On the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur, except in the thick places which follow the back, and at their ends on the front side. 
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they are not subject to wearing down, except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the recognition of it is not hidden from the senses upon examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done thus, that you adjust the fracture with the fingers in the most feasible manner, until the shape is made even, as is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint, if it requires it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inwards: then the patient experiences severe pain, and a pricking sensation, like the pricking that occurs in someone who has pleurisy: because the bone punctures the membrane, and also he experiences difficulty breathing, and coughing, and vomiting much blood: and this is difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And indeed the ancients devised many ingenious methods for it: and among them are those who say that you should give the patient foods which generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly may be inflamed, and distended, and push the fracture outwards. 
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, shrink from this, lest it quickly cause a hot abscess, if one has not already occurred.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if one has already occurred, then it adds to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a cupping glass be placed over the area, then let it suck strongly, and this is more similar to reason.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass may attract excess fluids to the area, due to its weakened state.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: the area must be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil, and cushions should be placed between the ribs until it is filled out, so that the bandaging is even when you wrap it around.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the patient should be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	But if something severe constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pricks the covering with a painful prick, and we fear for the patient, then we must cut over the area and uncover the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place over it the instrument that preserves the periosteum, which was mentioned earlier: and we should cut the bone gently, and incise it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, and treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	But if in the meantime a hot abscess develops, then hurry and soak small cushions in rose oil and place them over the area, and the patient should be treated as is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, he should also lie on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	On the restoration of a fracture of the dorsal and cervical vertebrae.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, sometimes a fracture happens to the bones of the neck, and rubbing/chafing rarely happens to them: and similarly also to the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you want to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, numb, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor clench them: and when you clench them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and he does not feel pain in them: then you should know that he will not be healed, and in most cases it is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels in them the clenching with the fingers and the pricking: then know that the nape of the neck/spinal cord is safe, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if something similar to this happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you want to know whether it will also be healed or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happened in the hands happens in them: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and excrement come out involuntarily: and when he is turned over onto his stomach, excrement comes out involuntarily: and when he is turned onto his back, and he wants to urinate, and he cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not work on his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	But if none of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from it is that you try the soothing of a hot abscess: in such a way that you place only crushed rose oil on the vertebra: or with the yolks of a roasted egg.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that on it several times a day, until such a time as the hot abscess subsides: then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters on the area, and bandage it firmly: and tell the patient to employ rest and quiet.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And he should not sleep on the side where he experiences the pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	But if, in the fractured bone, a fragment occurs, or something that has already separated from it, then you must cut through the skin, and remove it. 
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some promoting-flesh unguent, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the end of the coccyx bone is broken, and it is the end of the tailbone, then you must insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and straighten the fractured bone with your other hand, as best you can, and after proper alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then put a dressing over it, and remove it, and treat the wound with the aforementioned treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Hip bones are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	But if they are broken, then their fracture is nothing other than a shattering at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and they bend inwards: and the patient suffers pain in the area, and a pricking sensation: and the broken leg becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed, that you extend your hand upon it, until you determine the shape of the fracture.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the fracture is only at its extremities, then adjust that fracture, according to what is available to you for setting, until its natural shape is restored.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	However, if the fracture is lengthwise, or now bends inwards, then have the patient lie on his stomach, until you can reduce that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have set it, then apply a plaster on it: then place a splint made of wood or leather upon it: and bind it firmly, but not so tightly that you fear displacement of the fracture or movement of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And fill their hollow with something that will fill it, until the bandage holds it evenly: and tell the patient to sleep on his back, or on his uninjured side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if a hot abscess develops, then stop extending and setting it until the hot abscess subsides; and apply something to it which soothes it, as described previously, then return to setting it, and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if it happens in the sagittal suture, or it is shattered, extract it. 
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the Repair of a Fracture of the Shoulder Blade.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The shoulder blade is that which is between the elbow and the head of the scapula. 
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If, therefore, it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to the following shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And at the two ends two straps are tied.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from a high place: and the patient sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he places his broken arm upon the wood, until he comes to the armpit, in the middle of which the curve of the wood should be located.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then you hang something heavy above him so that the assistant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor sets the fracture with his hands at the same time, until the fracture returns as it should.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the patient lies on his back: and you suspend his hand from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two assistants, so that one of them holds what is above the fracture with his hands: and so that the other holds what is below it, and each of them extends it to his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind beneath the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and let each of the two assistants extend it to their two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If, therefore, the fracture is near the end of the shoulder, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the armpit, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. 
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a bandage be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then adjust the fracture with ease without force, until when the fracture is adjusted as is necessary, and it is applied with a good application: then bind it, if a hot swelling does not occur. 
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if a hot swelling occurs, then loosen the bandaging until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put upon it greasy wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the swelling subsides: then bind it: and the way of binding it is, that you put a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then support the arm on a helper, and let him place his hand spread open on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And put a cloth, and bind the arm upon the support, so that the arm stays in the place of the splints: unless something prevents you from that, or something from the broken bone changes for the worse on you. 
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something from the broken bone will shift on you, then use splints: and this is how, you place over the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And put between each splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splints with the binding that I described in the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And your binding should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture extends, the less tight the binding should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	Therefore, if you see the placement of the splints and the bandaging, as we have described, at the time when you immediately restore the limb, then proceed: and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the bandaging and splints until the seventh day, as we have described.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then examine the bandaging every three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in that place, or food is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive tightness of the bandaging.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, correct all of that, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not loosen the bandage, except after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his stomach: and place under the armpit a cushion evenly filled with wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And take care, at every hour of the night or day, that the shape of the fractured limb is not disturbed, or the bandage loosened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, correct all of that with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And arrange the patient's food according to the order we have previously described, so that the food is light at first, until the bone begins to knit: then it is necessary that you increase the richness of his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the usual practice for the humerus and the leg to knit in forty days: then it is necessary that it be unbandaged, and a bath administered, and medicated with ointments which strengthen it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	But if the fracture was severe, crushed: then do not remove the bandage and splints from it for up to fifty days, and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two radius bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of which is small: and that is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps, therefore, the larger radius bone is broken alone, or the small one: and perhaps they are broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When, therefore, the small radius is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower radius is broken, its fracture is bad and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If, therefore, the bone that is broken is the small radius above, then it is fitting for the physician, at its restoration, to apply a little extension gently until he makes it even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if it is the large radius that is broken, then it is necessary that he apply much stronger binding.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he place the form of the hand at its restoration, and its extension extended over a cushion. 
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be below all the fingers, or the rest; and the patient sits squarely upon himself, and let the cushion be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height, so that the patient does not experience difficulty. 
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the assistant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And let another assistant extend it from above in a similar manner.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then let the physician align the bone until he restores it to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	But if in the fracture of the bone there are fragments, then endeavor to return each fragment to its place with your skill. 
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if a separated fragment appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for you in its restoration: then cut down upon it, and remove it according to the method we have described in the things that have been mentioned before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	However, if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, so take the treatment for it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	But if at the beginning of your restoration a hot swelling should occur, then smear a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth upon it with a light bandage, until when the swelling subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then apply splints, and let the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be a little wider, and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most situations, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together. 
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandaging over the site of the fracture more strongly and firmly, and somewhat more so with the bandaging above the fracture, or below it: or place the bandaging a little more loosely than its bandaging, according to what was mentioned previously at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths, and not hard, rough ones.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be specifically of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have explained.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And examine the limb and the bandaging after [some] days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	But if something happens which needs correcting, such as an itching that occurs in the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with warmed water, until that itching subsides, and you leave the limb unbandaged, until it rests, then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	But if the bandaging has now loosened, and the bone has now shifted, and things similar to these: then correct all of it by your skill, and examine [it] again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of excessive tightness of the bandaging, then it is necessary that you loosen it a little, and leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, then bandage it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if none of those things which we have mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary that it be unbandaged, except after twenty days, or approximately that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient should be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be level, and let him be guarded by his own strength from agitated movements. 
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the dispositions of constitutions, and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that a fracture rarely happens to the metacarpus of the hand, and to the knuckles of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to it, unless by frequent rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, therefore, a fracture or bruise happens to the metacarpus, then it is necessary that the patient sit squarely, and that a seat be before him at an equal height.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it outstretched.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician align them, until they are joined together in a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and tow, unless a hot abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint over it according to the size of the area, and you have now wrapped it in a linen cloth. 
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	But if the fracture is in the lower part near the arch of the foot, then make something like a ball from cloth, and instruct the patient to press upon it with his fractured foot; then it should be bandaged with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And the splint should be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the sole of the foot, and tighten it as needed. 
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	However, if the fracture is on the outer side, then it is necessary to put a splint on top, and another splint below on the sole of the foot; and the hand should be open and straight. 
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a bandage, as the hand is turned, and extend between the fingers with a tie.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	But if a fracture of any of the joints of the fingers happens, then if it is the thumb, it should be set as needed.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it should be bandaged with a splint; and if you wish, apply a small, straight splint to it, so that the fracture is elevated and is not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, and index, or little, and ring fingers, then it should be set, and bound with the neighboring healthy finger: or they may all be bound together in a row: and that is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place upon it a small splint, as we said regarding the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your treatment, and after it, the possibility of a hot abscess, and treat it accordingly, when something like that occurs, according to what has repeatedly been explained.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ On the treatment of a fracture of the hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is frequently broken, and this is evident to the senses, since it turns inward and backward.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its treatment is done thus: that a bandage is tightened above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient is laid on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then let each bandage be extended by the assistant to his side in an even manner; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	But if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let there be a bandage at the area of the pubis so that the extension is made upward: and another bandage below the fracture. 
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let there be a bandage near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician aligns the bone with both his hands, until he restores it according to the likeness of its natural shape: and the bone is joined with a good joining.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandaging, if an abscess does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for a few days until the hot abscess subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	Moreover, its bandaging should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a stiff linen cloth, that is, a bandage, over the fracture: and fold it twice, or three times: and let some excess remain.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg until you reach the heel at the base of the buttock.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part on both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap what remains of the linen cloth over the leg and the hip.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place splints over the hip at the location of the fracture itself, and place one of these splints over the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the empty spaces between the leg and the hip with soft cloths, so that the bandaging is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with tight bandaging from the middle over the location of the fracture with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you extend with the bandage from the location of the fracture, the less tight, softer, and gentler your bandaging should be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pull on the two ends of the thread, which you inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore, tie the three splints that are on top with both (ends).
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with the two ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both (ends), also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side: so that the bandage is not moved from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then loosen the tightening over it, while it remains, so that neither corrosion, nor abscess, nor swelling, and things similar to them, happen to the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	But if any of those things happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, hurry with its loosening, and completely correct that which resulted from it, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if there is a fragment of bone in the bone that pricks: then it is necessary that you smooth it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, cut over it, and remove it: and treat it with that whose account preceded, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides splints being added to it, as we have said regarding the forearm and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of it thus broken, lameness does not happen to the patient.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored by itself, besides the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is subtracted: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions, and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely happens, but a bruise happens to it very often.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if a fracture does happen to it, then it is nothing other than either a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And all of this is observed with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that what has been broken apart of its parts is made even with the fingers, until it is gathered together, and joined according to what is possible of alignment and ease, and making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster of sesame flour, or of a mill, with egg white: and put upon it a round splint, if you need it: and bind over it a bandage suitable for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the conditions that we have described in the other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and things similar to it: thus, so that you may oppose each incident with that which suits it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	On the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, of which one is thick, and is called by the name of the leg: and the other is thin, and is called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of them from the types of fracture what happens to the two bones of the arm: and because of that its restoration is done, just as the restoration of the arm equally, and the procedure is one. 
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	But if the two bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned to all sides.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg turns to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it lower: and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and setting, and binding of splints accordingly, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a severe fracture, having much inflammation, that the extension be less and more gentle with your alleviation.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed in the leg there is something in the procedure beyond the arm: and it is, that when you set the splints, and complete all your work, then take two strips from pine wood, which is used in making the ceilings that are placed under the boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from those that are of small thickness, and yet not from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap upon each one cloth with two windings along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one on one side of the leg, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips in three places, at the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when tightening is prevented, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a splint of wood be prepared according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it preserves it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed it is mostly necessary that you do this in a fracture when it is accompanied by a wound specifically.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then examine the leg every day, and attend to it with the utmost care regarding an abscess, or swelling, or other such things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If, therefore, any of these things occur, then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed, God willing.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of the bones of the foot, and of the toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel bone, indeed, is not completely fractured.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot are sometimes fractured, and the toes are also rarely fractured: and they suffer no more than a bruise in most cases. 
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	But if a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see those bones raised above each other, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand, and place your foot on that which is raised up from those bones: then press, or tread on it: and adjust it until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster, and tow on top: and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the foot with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things which it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	Therefore, when three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The procedure for them, therefore, is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if any of the toes are broken, then restore them and align them according to what I have told you regarding the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place on your toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider than it: then place under the foot this board which I told you about, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place upon each toe a splint of its size, wrapped in a linen cloth: and bind the board to the bottom of the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the arch of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you not to forget to consider everything that I told you in the other fractures from the accidents which we have discussed: and oppose every accident with what is necessary. 
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Regarding the fracture of the woman's vulva, and the pubic bone, and the man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then have her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her somewhat toward the part of her back, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until she fills it: and let it be made in the vulva from it like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back little by little.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton comes out, until it becomes before the opening of the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small cushion upon her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When, therefore, she wants to urinate, let her remove the cotton with ease, then let her urinate: and replace it in the same way that you inserted it initially: then let her return to her first cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep, and tighten on its opening a small tube of reed, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the small tube forcefully until the bladder is inflated within the vulva, for the fracture returns (to place). 
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with cotton, and let it remain for several days, according to what we have described, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the pubic bone of a man, or of a woman, is broken, then employ for its restoration, and its setting, what we have described for the hip bone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially to one who has some knowledge or experience.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself shows you in most cases the right way to restore and bind it: therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the penis of a man is fractured, take the neck of a goose and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and left for three days, or about that, and it will be healed, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of bones when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is fitting for him who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or shoulder blade, or similar to it, that you hurry and phlebotomize him immediately, if the conditions for phlebotomy are favorable, as we have stated before. 
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	But if the wound is flowing with blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to staunch it, so that you sprinkle over it ground alum, if you do not have anything else at hand.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not postpone it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for you would cause bad complications to occur.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the broken bone is protruding above the exposed skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it and level it with your hands, with ease and gentle extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	But if its extension and leveling cannot be achieved with your hands, then reduce it with this instrument. 
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length is the measure of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason, it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity that he needs for the treatment in each kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round, and let it have a slight thickness so that it will not bend when compressed during the operation, and let it have a pointed tip with an edge at its extremity.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be thick from its middle down to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary that its curved pointed end be placed on the end of the protruding bone: and push it with this once, until the bone returns and is leveled somewhat.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to align the ends of the fracture together.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	But if its broken end is thin, and the instrument does not grip it well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If, however, you are completely unable to reduce them with what we have described, then cut it with a suitable knife from among the cutting instruments we have mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way you can. 
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape off whatever roughness and small fragments remain on the bone.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When, therefore, the bone is reduced, and the patient experiences severe, distressing pain after its reduction, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you render great assistance to the patient, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak a cloth in dark, astringent wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not put carrot or anything containing oil on the wound, lest it cause putrefaction and decay.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then apply splints when you have finished the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered: however, you should cut a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every precaution not to constrict the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For foolish physicians have often done this and have caused either death, or corrosion, or pus in their patients. 
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your bandaging be soft, gentle, unlike the bandaging of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some of the bad complications concerning it which we have described, and you find the pain in the area suspended: then you should not put splints on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them bandages from hard cloths in place of splints and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	However, when it is after one day or two days and you see the wound already beginning to generate pus, then remove from it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and things similar to it. 
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it heals and is cured.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be arranged in such a way that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	But if many days pass by the wound, and it neither heals nor is the pus cut off from it, then you should know that there are small chips of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary that you examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	And however many of those small bone fragments are loose, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them which are not loose, and prick the limb, and cause pain, try to cut into them and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if there should occur in the wound erysipelas or a malignant ulcer, that is, a corroding ulcer, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of them with the appropriate cure, the account of which has preceded in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And on which it is necessary that my discussion should dwell, and to which you should give your present attention, when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone and the shoulder blade, and similar large limbs, is that you do not attempt its extraction, for death often occurs from that, but rather leave it until it rots. 
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems good to you, and if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the treatment of a knot in the track of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This knot often occurs in the track of the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially one that is near the joints: and the shape of the limb is made ugly by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider then, if the node is recent: apply to it medications that have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and put them on the node in tow, and bind them tightly upon it with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the node is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tighten a lead plate appropriately over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing anything harmful from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the node has already turned into stone, and is hard, and necessity urgently compels its removal: then cut into it from the upper part of it, and incise the protruding excess: or scrape it with certain scrapers, until it is removed: and treat it, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	¶ On the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains afterward thin, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb remains afterward thin, weak: then that does not happen except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is, excessive loosening of the bandage and its tying not as it should be: or because of excessive tightness of the bandages, so that nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb: or because of excessive embrocation at the wrong time: or because of a lack of blood in the patient's body, and his weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for this is to nourish the patient, and to soften his body, until the blood in him increases.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch upon the limb: so that the pitch may attract much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And he should diligently apply a fomentation of it with tepid water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When crookedness and a protrusion or knot occurs in a limb already restored after its healing to a fractured bone, and the form of the limb is disfigured by it, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function: then you should not accept the opinion of him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And already there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters, who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this procedure is indeed very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, that it may be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knot are recent, then it is necessary that it be fomented with tepid water, in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as leaves of marshmallow, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a plaster should be made for it with a softening plaster, such as diachylon properly made.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or, mucilage of marshmallow root should be taken, and shaken with chicken fat or sesame oil, and it should be plastered with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or, ripe figs should be taken and ground with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among the medications that reduce solidification.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened with frequent, long-standing, and gentle rubbing, which is done with moistened hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb should be administered in every direction at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the crookedness has already been present and has become strong, and has turned into bone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has been brought about: then it is necessary that above it be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and what is superfluous of the knot or bone be cut away with fine scalpels: and that ease in that be administered with care and attention. 
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning the discussion on dislocation. 
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prevented from its motion, and the shape of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pains and injuries to happen to the patient.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hurry to its restoration, and not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place will fester, and perhaps with it, the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	For that reason, therefore, it is not appropriate for it to be moved, nor extended at the time of its festering.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it very often causes spasms and harmful pains to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary for you to hurry to the phlebotomy of the patient.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone, until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be fomented with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with that whose recollection will come in its place. 
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, also according to what preceded concerning fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are moved from their places by a small displacement, and are softened a little.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, until they are loosened toward the chest, until the patient's saliva runs, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is hampered in speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	However, when the dislocation is minor, then in many situations it returns by itself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete, total, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and the assistant should hold the patient's head: and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the dislocated jaw inside his mouth if the dislocation is on one side. 
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert both thumbs at the same time if the dislocation is on both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he applies even pressure.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And instruct the patient to exercise his jaws, and move them to chew in every direction.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should align the jaw, and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are [dislocated] at the same time: then administer steaming with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed, and they are not loose: then place over them small cushions of cloth, with cerate which is made from wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then they should be bound gently with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient's sleep be on his back: and let his head be positioned between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor try, or be forced to chew anything: rather let his food be a smooth soup, until, when the pains are removed, and the jaw is strengthened: then he may eat what he wants, and this should be administered with care.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not exert his mouth while eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is strengthened and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some point, and they do not return to their places: then fevers and continuous hiccups often occur from this: and perhaps the patient's bowels loosen, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, then know that it is fatal, and often he to whom this happens dies within ten days. 
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The clavicle is indeed not dislocated from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated outwardly, and this is clear to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is thus: that the patient lie on his back and extend his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then compress the place with your palm firmly, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place upon it a plaster and pads and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities, however, which follow the elbow and are continuous with it are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it is dislocated someday, then it is necessary that it be reduced and set according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put on it a plaster, and pads, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And order the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest, until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the extremity of the shoulder is reduced, when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the shoulder.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder is not dislocated, except according to three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is, that it be dislocated towards the armpit downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it be dislocated towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And sometimes it is dislocated towards the upper part of the shoulder: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated backwards, because of the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the sinews/tendons.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed it is mostly dislocated and comes out downwards toward the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it comes out in them quickly, and goes in quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of that, namely because it comes out with difficulty, and goes in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps a blow or a fall happens to some men, and the Humerus is infected with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of that, that it is now dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary, therefore, that you examine it until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is recognized when it is below toward the armpit: and you should distinguish between the dislocated Humerus and the healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a manifest difference between them, and you find a concavity in the head of the Humerus, and under the armpit, to the touch, the head of the humerus is as if it were an egg: and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all ways.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you will find the touch manifest, nor is it hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And the reduction of this dislocation is indeed easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that the assistant raises his hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and strongly raise the joint upwards to its place: and let the assistant raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should place it lower, for it will return quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient is laid on his back, and a ball of wool, which is between soft and tight, is placed under his armpit.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel upon the ball, and forcefully raise the head of the humerus, and draw the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant should hold the patient's head so that it is not moved downwards: for it will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: have present a man who is taller than the patient, and let him stand at the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift his armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant should pull the patient's hand down towards his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, to weigh him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: that is, a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, the top of which is round in shape: like the handle of a pestle: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then it should be placed under the patient after soft cloths have been placed over the top of the wood, and the patient stands along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then his hand is extended downwards on one side, and his body is extended forcefully on the other side: for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if its reduction is difficult by all the methods we have described, then use this treatment: namely, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers, which has a round head, so that its entry into the depths of the armpit is eased, according to this form. 
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are tied over the rounded head so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then it is placed under the patient's armpit, so that the hand, or arm, is extended over the wood downwards: and the wood is tied over the upper arm and forearm and the extremity of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is placed over the step of a ladder widthwise, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint goes in immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When, therefore, its entry is completed in whatever way possible, then it is necessary that you place a ball of wool of equal size under the armpit.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with frankincense, and egg white over the whole shoulder, just as it turns over on itself. 
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind moderately tightly under the armpit, and the bandage is rolled over the plaster from above, and his hand is tied to his neck, and it is left, and his hand is not moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the patient, until the limb is strengthened: since this is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven days, or five, a larger bandage is put on, and is exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it becomes firm and is not softened, then it is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture which occurs in it, or because of some other cause: then it is necessary that it be treated with a cautery with three holes, according to what was stated previously in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandaging are replaced on it several times, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and he cannot raise it to the upper parts: then know that its sinews which are at the head of the shoulder, are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The reduction, however, of a dislocation which occurs toward the chest and breast, or toward the back, is done with pressing and extending with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining bandaging and treatment is administered to it, until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	But if heaviness occurs in the limb after healing, and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use the bath frequently, until that heaviness is relieved, and it returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty: and it is indeed dislocated to all sides, and especially to the front, or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it is falling under sight, and under touch, in whatever way it is dislocated. 
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you compare the dislocated elbow with a healthy one, it is clearly revealed to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you must hurry, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess happens to it. 
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess happens to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not healed at all, especially when it is to the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is the worst of all kinds of dislocation, and of more vehement pain to them: and often death comes down with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is among those that are possible to reduce, is that his hand be extended with two hands: and his arm be stretched out, and the physician's hands be above the elbow and below it, and he himself push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles the hand with his hand, until he strikes with the base of his palm the elbow that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	But if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong, very forceful extension: and it is that two assistants extend the arm: and two assistants also hold it, so that it is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is rotated in every direction after a long, doubled cloth, or a broad bandage, is wrapped around his hand. 
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it may be among those things which assist in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then let him push the joint with a strong push, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, in which there is astringency and desiccation with egg white: and it is bandaged with a suitable bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm is suspended from the patient's neck, and left for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If, therefore, the joint is firm in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint is not well joined, then repeat the plaster and the bandaging, and leave it for several days, until it is joined. 
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if heaviness happens to it after the reduction of the joint, and the disposition is to move: then administer moistening by bathing, and gentle rubbing, and compression, until it is relieved, or place upon the joint of the ilium, that is, the fat of a ram's buttock.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be bandaged, and leave it on it for a day and a night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and put him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When, therefore, he sweats, then rub the joint with a moderate rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on it the ram's buttock once, and a second time, and a third time with entry into the bath, until it is relieved.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, put on it moist cow dung, warmed with butter, and bind it on it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is relieved and returns to its proper condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	On the treatment of dislocation of the jaw.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The wrist is frequently dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the forearm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike the other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be swiftness in the reduction of its dislocation at the time in which it is dislocated, before the place swells up, or a hot swelling occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation in it is as follows: you should place the wrist of the weak hand on a board, and an assistant should extend its hand, and the physician should place his palm upon the prominence of the joint, and press it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm now recedes toward the inside of the hand: then the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board at the time of extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inward upon the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed upon the board, so that the hand of the physician falls upon the prominence itself of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster that soothes swelling, and leave it alone, and do not repeat the procedure.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate it, and you are not able to reduce it, after some days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains in its crooked state: and it does not harm the patient at all, except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything: then you should know that the nerves have been severed, or worn away.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no remedy in this case, except to cauterize it near the site of the injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps this will not be of any benefit.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When, therefore, the setting does not reset, then place upon it the plaster that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be bound, and left for five days: afterwards it should be unbound and left free, and the hand exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if its movement is hindered, and some serious condition occurs in it: then soften it with warm water and rubbing several times, until it is relieved.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When one of the fingers is dislocated in any direction, either backwards towards the back of the hand, or forwards towards the palm: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns (to its place).
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the tip of the finger, and stretch it towards the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it like this for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it becomes straight again on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When night comes, bandage it as described previously, and don't fail to unbind it during the day; and exercise it with movement, and bandage it again at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days, until it is strengthened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do likewise with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bandage it to that side, and perform your initial procedure on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly, do so with it when it is dislocated to the other sides.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When a complete dislocation of the dorsal vertebrae or neck happens to someone, or many vertebrae are moved from their places, then there is no cure in it, because death comes quickly to the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of that is that the patient's excrement comes out involuntarily, and they cannot hold it: and often some of their limbs are weakened because of it, or both their legs, or both their arms, or one of them: or one vertebra is moved from its place. 
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Indeed, it is often dislocated, because their dislocation often occurs in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is dislocated posteriorly is called a hump.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it, indeed, is that you then consider if the hump arises from childhood: then there is no treatment in it, nor any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in that which happens from a fall, or a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy discourse. 
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Most of which does not return with benefit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have now abbreviated from that, a little of which excuses much of it from its proximity to my purpose: and by my explanation by which I have explained it, and have fashioned its instrument in a different way from that by which they showed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, therefore, that in a hump which happens from the front part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which happens to both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And none of them are treated, except that which occurs on the back properly, with what I describe: and that is, that the patient be stretched out on his face on a level platform near a wall: and damp straw be spread under him so that his chest is not injured.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood, fixed in a hole in the ground, should be placed at the end of the platform, near his head: and another piece of wood near his feet at the other end of the platform: and an assistant should hold the wood, and it should not be fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another assistant should hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap a soft, strong bandage over the patient's head and under his armpits: and extend the end of the bandage to the piece of wood that is at his head: and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another bandage above his hips, and above his knees, and around his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages, and tie them to the other piece of wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then each assistant should stretch the bandage towards the end of the piece of wood, and the two pieces of wood should not be moved from the places in which they are fixed: however, they should not be fixed, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should place his palms on the vertebra with force, until it returns (to place): or place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he ties his feet over the board until it returns (to place).
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And hollow out in the wall, which we mentioned is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board over the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him press firmly, until the vertebra is compressed, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, work with a winch which is turned with your hand: and it is thus, that you fix in the ground near the patient's head at the foot of the support two pieces of wood, whose length is one cubit: and near his head at the foot of the support two pieces of wood. 
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length which is between each piece of wood be one palm: and now in each place a hole is made, in which the winch runs: and let each piece of wood be fixed firmly in the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted: and it is a winch on which a cord is wound in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which is fixed a piece of wood, whose length is a palm including that which is turned: and in the two other pieces of wood it is similarly the same.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the cords which you tightened on the patient's chest with the winch which is at his head: and the cords which you tightened on his legs with the winch which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let an assistant stand at each winch, who turns his hand with the handle with which the winch is turned: and let the physician set the vertebra straight, as we have described.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the winch, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the vertebra returns and the place is made even, then it is necessary that you place a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then tow.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards place over the plaster a splint made from a board, whose width should be three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length an amount that covers the place of the hump, and over part of the healthy vertebra.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is bandaged with the bandage that we spoke of.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the patient should use a light diet until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	But if some amount of protrusion remains at the site at the end of healing: then it is necessary that softening and soothing medications be administered, with the application of the board that we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a sheet of lead is applied to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a protrusion occurs at the last of the dorsal vertebrae: and a dislocation is thought to exist because of it, and it is this bone which is now prominent.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, this treatment should not be attempted on him, for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder experience only dislocation: and they do not experience what happens to other joints from slight displacement and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the hip joint is dislocated in four directions.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated forwards and backwards.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is most often dislocated inwards; and it is rarely dislocated forwards and backwards.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inwards is this: when you join the leg of the unwell person level with the unwell leg, it is longer: and their knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the unwell person cannot bend their foot at the groin: and the place that follows the groin is swollen with a hot swelling, because the head of the hip has now arrived there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation outwards is that his symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation forwards is that he extends the healthy leg fully; nevertheless he does not bend it without pain, which is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot on it forwards: and his urine is retained, and his groin swells, and when walking he treads on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him who has suffered a dislocation backwards is that he does not extend the knee, nor can he bend it before he bends the groin: and his leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at the location of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction, however, of this kind of dislocation is that you then consider, if the dislocation is old, which has now become chronic in the person who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no cure in it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, no attempt at all should be made on it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in him whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you rotate the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left: for perhaps it will return, and will not need other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he should extend his leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied on his leg above the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand from above, so that he inserts his hands under his armpits. 
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie it with a soft bandage over the top of the hip, and hold the end of another bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And its extension should be either from the front part of the groin to the part of the fork, or from the back to the part of the back. 
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And the extension of all of them should be at the same time, until the patient is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this type of extension is a common type of the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If, therefore, the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then every type needs what I will say about its own treatment. 
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In its proper reduction when the dislocation is inwards, it is necessary that the patient be laid on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place the bandage over the root of the hip, in the part that is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin area to the higher part of the body, to the area of the collarbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong attendant should take his arms and reduce the swollen place of the weakened hip, and extend it outwards with strong extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is the easiest of the remaining types of treatment by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it gives you trouble, and it does not yield to you at all with this type of treatment: then it is necessary that the two feet of the weakened [patient] be tied together with a strong, soft bandage, above the two heels, and above the two knees: and let the length of each [leg] from its counterpart be the amount of four fingers: and let the weakened leg be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weakened [patient] should be suspended above the top of a beam, which is in the house: and its length from the ground should be the amount of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then order a strong young man to secure the head of the hip: and let another young man be suspended with the weakened [patient]: and let another young man push, securing the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	However, in its proper resetting, when the dislocation is outwards, it is necessary that the weakened [patient] lie on a table, according to what we described in the one having a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a bandage be tightened on his weakened leg, specifically, and on his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let an additional piece of wood be placed in the middle of the table, firmly fixed: over which damp cloths should be wrapped so that it does not injure the weakened [patient]: and let the piece of wood be between his thighs, so that he is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let each assistant extend toward his own side, and the physician guide the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to the resetting, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place him upon the board, and press upon it, just as we have said regarding a hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the patient lie upon his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is toward the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the patient be extended quickly: and this is according to the same description, upon a platform: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand upon the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he should squeeze it with the other hand, and with that squeezing, extend it downwards toward the part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is toward the back, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, and be raised above the ground: rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon something hard, just as is necessary if his hip is dislocated outwardly, according to what we have said about his lying upon both hips: and this is with him on his face, and the ligaments extended, according to what we have said just now. 
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that pressure be applied with a board also upon the place to which the joint protrudes, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return will not be hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the patient: and when you see them equal, and the patient flexes his leg and extends it without hesitation: then you will know that the limb has now returned as it should: then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to either side: and let the patient adhere to rest for three or four days. 
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now healed: then release the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening, then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and have him delay walking on both for a few days, until he is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Regarding dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and downwards, that is, to the back. 
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to bring his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not connect with the hip, then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all its manners of dislocation is that you have the patient sit upright, so that he now extends his leg if he can upon it, and your back connects to his face: and you place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his knee connect with your palms, and straighten them with your fingers upon his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then press with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And let another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg connects with the hip smoothly, not with difficulty.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a plaster to it and bind the leg to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bandage them together with a band for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the patient not walk for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if its reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with bandages, the description of which preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone is sometimes moved a little, and sometimes dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, extending to the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment for its displacement is easy to restore: and it is that it be extended gently with the hands and adjusted until it returns (to its place).
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In treating it when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and a very strong assistant should hold him from the back of his back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then you hold with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left (hand) twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the top of the foot with the right towards the leg without force.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the top of the foot toward the leg on the third time, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If, therefore, it returns in one time, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot straightened, it is good: and if not, then repeat the procedure upon it: because it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if its reduction is prevented for you by that which we have described, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg firmly in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs: and you will have already wrapped cloth around it, so that it does not injure the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let an assistant take hold of his thigh: afterwards, let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands, or with a bandage which he binds above the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let each assistant extend against the extension of his partner: and let the peg stand between the two thighs of the patient, holding him, so that his body is not drawn downwards at the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the physician correct the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the healthy leg below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When therefore the dislocation returns, and the soundness of its reduction is apparent to you, then apply a plaster and tow, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you take care or beware of the tendons which are above the heel posteriorly, that the bandaging not be too tight upon them, and injure them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	But if the bandaging loosens, tighten it: then loosen it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he attempts to walk before that time, there is no assurance that the dislocation will not recur, and become worse, and after that will not receive a cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	But if a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary that you administer for its relief what we have previously described in another place concerning its treatment and fomentation, until it is removed. 
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning dislocation of the toes, and treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated of them be set with a little extension without force: and that indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the top of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient place his foot on a place level with the ground, or on a board: and he stands as if walking. 
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press upon it with your foot forcefully until it returns, and you see it already set, and no protrusion appears in the area.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the sole of his foot a board which encompasses the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it firmly for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and have him abstain from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from relapse.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning the types of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When any of these things happen, and you attempt its treatment and its restoration, death often results; and because of this no one ought to presume upon the treatment of such a case unless he is skilled in the art, of long experience, compassionate, pious, cautious, not bold, nor presumptuous, and unless he uses, at the beginning, medicines which only soothe hot abscesses; and he should leave the patient to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you foresee or hope for recovery from destruction with mildness of the illness, and in which some hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If, therefore, the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess; and treat the wound with a suitable drying ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	But if the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate bone fragments occur, then attempt their removal, and do with it what we have said about simple ailments of this kind in their respective places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be cautious according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, as I have previously advised you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and safer for your body among those in your time.
