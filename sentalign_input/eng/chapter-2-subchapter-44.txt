 CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR.
On cutting down upon the tumour which occurs on the outside of the throat, and is called 'Elephant of the throat'.
 This tumour which is called 'Elephant of the throat' is a large tumour of the colour of the body; it commonly occurs in women.
It is of two kinds, congenital and acquired.
As to the congenital, there is no treatment for it.
The acquired is of two kinds: one resembles a sebaceous cyst, the other resembles the tumour arising from an arterial aneurysm, and it is dangerous to incise it, so on no account must you apply a knife to the latter kind, except any that are small; if you try and explore them with a probe and you find they are like sebaceous cysts and not adherent to any blood-vessel, then immediately cut down upon them as you would a cyst and remove them with whatever capsule may surround them, if they are contained within a capsule; and if not, dissect away the whole accurately; then treat the place with suitable remedies.
