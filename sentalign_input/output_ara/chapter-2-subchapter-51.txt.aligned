On the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen.	On the amputation of warts occurring on the belly.	0.8927659
Often, many people have warts on their abdomens and on other parts of their bodies. These warts are called "fungating" because they resemble mushrooms: their stalks are thin and their heads thick, and their lips are transformed. Some of them are small, and some become very large.	Some people often get warts on the belly and on the rest of the body, called fungous warts, because of their resemblance to fungi. They have a slender pedicle and a broad head, the edges of which are sometimes inverted ; and some are small, whereas others of them grow very big.	0.79504013
I have seen a man with two warts on his abdomen that were very similar to mushrooms, no difference, white with thin stalks and transformed, cracked lips, from which moisture constantly seeped. I excised them, and the weight of one was about eighteen ounces, and the other about six ounces.	I myself once saw a man who had two warts on his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else; they were white and had thin pedicles. Their edges were inverted and had split open, and a humour flowed continually from them. I amputated them both and weighed them: one came to about eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces.	0.87152636
The procedure for excising them is as follows: observe; if the patient has a moist humor, and if the wart is white, moist, and thin-stalked, then excise it with a wide scalpel. Have cauteries ready in the fire, because often much blood gushes out when they are excised.	This is the operation for amputating them: examine the patient carefully, and if he be of a humid temperament and the colour of the warts be white, and if they are soft, with a thin stalk, amputate them with a broad scalpel. But you should also have at hand cauteries in a fire; for often in amputating them there is much haemorrhage.	0.8622497
Therefore, be prepared, and if the bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it.  If you see that the patient is cowardly and frightened of being cut with iron, then take a strong lead thread and tightly tie it around the wart that has these characteristics. Leave it for two days, then tighten the lead thread further, and continue tightening the lead thread.	So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them. On the other hand if you see that the patient is frightened and dreads the cutting of them with the scalpel, take a wire of stout lead, and ligature this type of wart and leave for two days.	0.84715164
Do this every time it affects the wart until it is severed and falls off by itself without trouble. If the wart has a thick stalk, there is some danger and risk in excising it, especially those on the abdomen. However, it may be possible to excise half of it or part of it.	Then increase the stricture by the lead wire and go on doing this as it sinks into the wart, until the wart is cut through and spontaneously falls away with no trouble. But if the warts have stout pedicles there is some risk and fear in the cutting of them, especially those that occur on the belly. Sometimes, however, you can cut away the half, or some part, and then cauterize to prevent recurrence.	0.79553205
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to excise a wart that is dark in color, minimally sensitive, and has an unpleasant appearance, for it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer after this.	Then dress until the wound is healed. But beware of trying to cut away growths that are dark in colour, with little sensation and hideous in appearance, for they are cancerous tumours. I shall soon be mentioning cancer.	0.79105407
