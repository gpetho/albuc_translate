of the fracture of the mandible/jaw
When the mandible/jaw is broken underneath, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is internal only, and is not broken in two, except for internal fragments, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth;
And if the fracture is in the left mandible/jaw, put your right index finger in, and gently push the fracture inwards, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the fracture of the mandible/jaw is separated in two, then you must apply traction from both sides until it is even.
And if loosening or breaking of the teeth occurs, secure them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then apply a plaster to the broken mandible/jaw, and put on a double bandage;
And put over the bandage a well-made large splint, or a piece of leather evenly shaped, long and wide according to the jaw, and tie it on as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then reset what has changed;
and apply a plaster, made from mill dust with plenty of egg or sesame flour, after you have removed the previous plaster;
and put light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed;
often he is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses develop, then administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, see if any piece of bone has been removed;
then carefully remove it with instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a lancet according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, stitch the wound, if it is large, and apply one of the plasters suitable for this, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
