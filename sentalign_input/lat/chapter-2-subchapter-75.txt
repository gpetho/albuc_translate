Teachings for Midwives, on how to treat live embryos, when they emerge in an unnatural position.
Chapter 75.
It is necessary for the midwife first to know the form of natural birth.
Among the signs of this is that when you see the woman bearing down, and she desires to smell fresh air, and the pressure from labor lessens over her, and the embryo's exit hastens, then you know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head-first with the afterbirth, either attached or hanging from the umbilical cord.
When you see these signs, it is then necessary to press on her abdomen so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends head-first, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of these impurities with good purification.
But any other birth than this is unnatural and unfavorable.
For sometimes the fetus emerges feet-first, or its body exits before its head, with one foot or hand, or one foot alone; or its head and hand emerge; or its abdomen appears; and perhaps it turns on its neck, and other such unfavorable presentations.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise, precise in all these matters, and cautious of error and deception; and I am showing every one of these forms and how to manage each, and it shall be explained and demonstrated.
When the fetus emerges head-first in its natural exit, and this becomes intense for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or have other women hold her, and steam her vulva with a fenugreek decoction and moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert between her fingers a small spatula and split the afterbirth with it, cutting it with her fingernail until the moisture contained within flows out; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the enema to bear down; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
The fetus will then emerge immediately.
But if the two hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to gently and gradually push them back.
If it does not go back easily, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet upwards; then shake the seat over the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall during the shaking.
If, however, the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them off and extract the rest of the fetus; bind its hand with cloth and draw it out steadily, and it will emerge.
_When the fetus emerges feet-first_
When the fetus emerges feet-first, it is necessary to push the feet upward, then gradually turn the fetus, and then adjust its position.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When the fetus emerges up to the hips, instruct the woman to bear down, and make her sneeze with a condiment; then the fetus will emerge, God willing.
If the fetus does not emerge with this approach, then gradually push it back until it is in the natural position.
Then it will emerge easily.
But if it is still prevented from emerging with all that we have described, then take marshmallow mucilage, sesame oil, and dissolved gum; pound everything thoroughly in a mortar, then apply it to the woman’s vulva and lower abdomen.
Next, have her sit in warm water until her lower abdomen relaxes.
When you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then prepare a suppository of myrrh and place it.
When she has held the suppository for an hour, then have her sit on a seat.
Next, make her sneeze, and gently press her mouth and nose, and apply gentle pressure on her lower abdomen.
The fetus will then emerge immediately.
_When the fetus emerges on its knees and hands_
When the fetus emerges in this way, she must carefully insert her hands gradually.
Then the woman should be laid back on her neck, with her legs hanging down, lying on the bed with her hands folded.
Then gently press on her abdomen.
Then remove what is beneath her feet from the cushions, so that she is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, take its feet and shake them with firm motion.
Next, press gradually above the lower abdomen until the fetus moves upward.
Then insert her hands, gradually aligning the fetus, and instruct the woman to bear down until the fetus emerges.
_When the fetus is hanging laterally by its arms_
Carefully attempt to reposition its hand.
If this is not possible, then lift the woman and have her walk.
If she cannot walk, then lay her on the bed and shake her legs firmly.
Next, apply the liniment prepared from mucilage.
If labor seizes her, then have her sit on a seat.
Then work on repositioning its hand and align the fetus in the natural position, and make the woman sneeze, instructing her to bear down until the fetus emerges.
_When the fetus emerges head-down, with arms extended, and its face toward the mother's back_
The midwife must hold the fetus’s hand, then turn it gently and adjust it with ease.
When it is properly aligned, then apply the mixture of oil and mucilage on her vulva as we described.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When you have done this, have her sit on a seat and instruct her to lean to her right side.
Then instruct her to bear down and make her sneeze with condiments.
_When the fetus is positioned sideways_
When the fetus descends to the mouth of the uterus in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is released.
If it then hangs over the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the umbilical cord, so it does not hold it back and cause death.
Then push the fetus back inward until it is in the appropriate position, and instruct the woman to bear down several times; then it will emerge with ease.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
But five is something unnatural, and they do not survive at all; even if they are multiple, they are contained in one membrane, and are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them a ligament in each of their umbilici.
And sometimes they emerge as one fetus does, with a natural, easy exit; and they emerge with a difficult exit, as we have described.
But if any of them are difficult at birth, and they come to the situation we mentioned with unnatural positions, then care for them as we have described, and let the midwife be skillful, and let her act with ease and patience, and use her ingenuity in every position with what is prepared for her, guided toward safety.
Recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and is aborted.
Sometimes one is formed in the womb, or two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven, or more, up to ten; and it has been verified by me that a woman in aborting expelled seven, and another fifteen, all fully formed.
Which was accomplished by the measurement of a glorious sage.
Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife.
For perhaps something similar to that may come to her; let her, therefore, apply to it whatever is necessary.
