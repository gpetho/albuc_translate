Chapter eighty-six on the treatment of colds and fistulas.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and old, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly suppurates without ceasing, is called in general, in any organ it may be, a fistula, and we call it zakam.
And the fistula is in reality a hard, white, solidified knot without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather, and therefore some have called it a feather.
And it is sometimes moist, constantly suppurating, and perhaps the moisture ceases at times, and this moisture may be abundant or little, thick or thin.
And I have already presented in the section on wounds that every ulcer that does not heal and in which no flesh grows is due to one of nine causes, one of which is either due to a lack of blood in the body, or to its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its lips that prevents the growth of good flesh, or because it is full of damage and dirt, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter that suppurates it is of poor quality, or because the medicine is not suitable for its treatment, or because of corruption that has occurred in the town, such as a plague, or because of a peculiarity in the town, as happened in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of swellings is slow by nature, or because there is one bone or several bones in it.
And I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the section, and it is necessary for me here to acquaint you with the treatment of fistula and zakam, which is by way of manual work.
Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, and among them are fistulas that end in large veins and arteries, or in a nerve, or in the peritoneum, or in the intestines, or in the bladder, or in a rib, or in a vertebra of the back, or in a joint of the complex joints, such as the hand and foot, and among them are those that lead to the vicinity of a vital organ, and so on.
So whatever of these fistulas are of this description, they are among the diseases that are difficult to heal, which do not accept treatment, and working on them is hardship and ignorance.
So if there are fistulas that do not reach these places that I have mentioned, and you hope and desire to treat them, and you want to arrive at the knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron if the fistula passes straight, and explore it with it.
But if there is a curvature in the fistula, then explore it with a probe of thin lead, because the lead softens its body, so it slips in easily and bends towards the curvature.
And if the fistula has many openings that you cannot trace with the probe, then inject one of its openings, for the moisture that you inject into it will pass towards the other openings and flow from them, then complete the examination in any way possible for you to know if there is a bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is one fistula with many openings, and ascertain all of that with the extent of your ability by inquiring of the patient about the presence of pain when you press your hand on the place, and so on, from the signs and causes incidental to the swelling.
So if you have ascertained all of that with certainty, then proceed to the treatment with confidence, which is that you look, and if the fistula is apparent and near, or in a healthy place far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have mentioned to you, then incise the fistula according to what I have previously described, and extract what is in it of solidified matter, corrupted flesh, excess flesh, and what grows in its opening of flesh, or wart, and so on, and treat it until it heals.
But if the fistula is deep-bottomed and straight, then you should incise it in depth as much as you can, then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh, then use threads soaked in sharp medicines and insert them into the bottom of the fistula that you reach with the iron.
Do that to it several times until that sharp medicine eats away all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption, then treat it with ointments that grow healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal with that, then cauterize it according to what has been previously described.
And if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and that is confirmed to you, then examine it and incise it as I have told you, unless you are prevented by an obstacle of a vein or nerve or vital organ, as we have said.
And if the bone is exposed to you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals.
And if it does not heal and suppurates as it used to do, then know that you have not reached all of the eradication of the corruption, so expose all of it again, and complete its scraping and cleansing with your utmost effort, then dress it.
If it heals, otherwise, know that the corruption is in a deep recess of corruption. Expose all of what is on it again, and fully scrape it and cleanse it with your best effort if the corrupted bone was a small bone and you were able to pull it, pull it with the gentle hooks that are suitable for that. If there were many bones, try to pull them all and don't leave anything from it with your best effort. If something from the ligaments obstructs you before it, and there's no danger in cutting it, then cut those ligaments and the flesh, if it is there, and free the bones.
If you can't extract the bones at your time, then apply to the wound what putrefies it, and leave it for days until what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments putrefies. Keep the wound from healing, the incision that you made during your work. Rather, put on it, if you fear that, cotton dipped in powdered sulfur with oil or cotton dipped in the Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments putrefy and the bones become bare, it will be easy to extract and pull them.
And if it is one large bone, such as the tibia or femur bone and the like, and what is corrupted of it is only its surface, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption are gone, then dress the wound.
But if what is corrupted of it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it all to where the corruption ends, then treat it until it heals.
And I will tell you about a zakam that occurred to a man in his leg, so that you may take it as an example and an aid in your treatment.
This man was young, about thirty years old, and he had a pain in his leg due to a cause that moved upon him from within the body until the matter reached the leg and it swelled a great swelling, and there was no external cause. Then time passed with the error of the physicians until the swelling opened and many matters flowed from it, and his treatment was mishandled until the leg became zakam and there were many openings in it, all of which suppurated pus and body fluids. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one among them skilled in the craft of the hand, until they came to me. I saw his leg, and the matters were flowing from those openings profusely, and the man's body had become thin and his color yellow. I inserted the probe into one of those openings, and the probe led to the bone. Then I examined all the openings and found that they led to each other from all sides of the leg. So I hastened and incised one of those openings until I exposed some of the bone, and I found it corrupted, eaten away, blackened, putrefied, and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow. So I sawed what was exposed to me and what I could reach of the corrupted bone, and I thought that there was no corruption in the bone other than that which I had cut and sawed, and that I had eradicated it. Then I proceeded to dress the wound with healing medicines for a longer period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and exposed the bone again, above the first exposure, and I found the corruption connected to the bone. So I sawed what appeared to me also of that corruption, then I tried to dress it, but it did not dress or heal. Then I exposed it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and tried to dress it, but it did not dress until I cut about a span of the bone and removed it with its marrow. Then I dressed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and recovered.
And this repetition in his operation and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness and his low tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because he used to have at all times, from excessive vomiting, a bad faint. So he recovered completely, and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and he was not afflicted in walking with any harm that would harm him at all.
And if a protruding bone in a place of the body is broken, then it is necessary to saw it in this manner: Take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone and order someone to pull it upwards, and make another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage, then tie it to the flesh that is under the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is pulled downwards, and you expose the flesh from the place that you want to saw so that the saw does not harm the flesh, and you place a piece of wood or a board under the bone from below tightly, because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone.
And the sawing should be a little above the place of the corruption, so that there is no corruption in the cavity of the bone, so it does not appear on its surface to the senses, and you are forced to saw it again.
And if the bone is corrupted and not protruding, but connected to each other, and the corruption is in its middle or in some of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides, then place the wood from below, then saw it from the first side where the corruption is, and when you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little away from the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in a joint, you cut the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
And if the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then there is no solution but scraping.
And if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or the metatarsus of the foot, then the matter of its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel the corruption however it appears to you, and scrape it and cleanse it in any way you can, and by any trick that is right for you, as long as you are not obstructed by a vein or nerve.
And know that the cutters and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, their erection, their thickness and thinness, their largeness and smallness, their hardness and porosity, therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work a tool similar to that work.
And know that the works themselves may guide you to the type of tool that you need if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because whoever is skilled in the craft and has witnessed various types of diseases may deduce for himself similar tools for each disease. And I have illustrated for you at the end of this chapter several tools that you may take as examples to follow and as a measure to compare with others, God willing.

The head of this probe is shaped like the head of a nail, rounded.
And its engraving is like the engraving of the scalpel.
It is only suitable for scraping the heads of joints if they are corrupted or a large, wide bone.

And similarly, all that we have mentioned of scalpels and lancets should be made.
